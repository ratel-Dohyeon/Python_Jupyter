E-mail: rf.dusp-u@dnarud.euqinimod","While the crucial role of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) in the cell cycle is now recognized, deciphering their molecular mode of action at the structural level still remains highly challenging and requires a combination of many biophysical approaches. Among them, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) has been extremely successful in the last decade and has become an indispensable technique for addressing many of the fundamental questions regarding the activities of IDPs. After introducing some experimental issues specific to IDPs and in relation to the latest technical developments, this article presents the interest of the theory of polymer physics to evaluate the flexibility of fully disordered proteins. The different strategies to obtain 3-dimensional models of IDPs, free in solution and associated in a complex, are then reviewed. Indeed, recent computational advances have made it possible to readily extract maximum information from the scattering curve with a special emphasis on highly flexible systems, such as multidomain proteins and IDPs. Furthermore, integrated computational approaches now enable the generation of ensembles of conformers to translate the unique flexible characteristics of IDPs by taking into consideration the constraints of more and more various complementary experiment. In particular, a combination of SAXS with high-resolution techniques, such as x-ray crystallography and NMR, allows us to provide reliable models and to gain unique structural insights about the protein over multiple structural scales. The latest neutron scattering experiments also promise new advances in the study of the conformational changes of macromolecules involving more complex systems.",Denatured state;ensemble of conformations;induced folding;protein folding;random coil;small angle x-ray scattering;unstructured protein;wormlike chain.

However, the quantitative implications of this behavior have remained unclear, largely because the effective theta-state, the central reference point for the underlying polymer collapse transition, has eluded experimental determination. Here, we used single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy and two-focus correlation spectroscopy to determine the theta points for six different proteins. While the scaling exponents of all proteins converge to 0.62 ± 0.03 at high denaturant concentrations, as expected for a polymer in good solvent, the scaling regime in water strongly depends on sequence composition. The resulting average scaling exponent of 0.46 ± 0.05 for the four foldable protein sequences in our study suggests that the aqueous cellular milieu is close to effective theta conditions for unfolded proteins. In contrast, two intrinsically disordered proteins do not reach the Θ-point under any of our solvent conditions, which may reflect the optimization of their expanded state for the interactions with cellular partners. Sequence analyses based on our results imply that foldable sequences with more compact unfolded states are a more recent result of protein evolution.",protein folding;single-molecule FRET;coil-globule transition;polymer theory

PP1 achieves its biological specificity by forming holoenzymes with more than 200 known regulatory proteins. Interestingly, most of these regulatory proteins (≥70%) belong to the class of IDPs (intrinsically disordered proteins). Thus structural studies highlighting the interaction of these IDP regulatory proteins with PP1 are an attractive model system because it allows general parameters for a group of diverse IDPs that interact with the same binding partner to be identified, while also providing fundamental insights into PP1 biology.

Without hydration water, proteins would not fold correctly and would lack the conformational flexibility that animates their three-dimensional structures. Motions in globular, soluble proteins are thought to be governed to a certain extent by hydration-water dynamics, yet it is not known whether this relationship holds true for other protein classes in general and whether, in turn, the structural nature of a protein also influences water motions. Here, we provide insight into the coupling between hydration-water dynamics and atomic motions in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP), a largely unexplored class of proteins that, in contrast to folded proteins, lack a well-defined three-dimensional structure. We investigated the human IDP tau, which is involved in the pathogenic processes accompanying Alzheimer disease. Combining neutron scattering and protein perdeuteration, we found similar atomic mean-square displacements over a large temperature range for the tau protein and its hydration water, indicating intimate coupling between them. This is in contrast to the behavior of folded proteins of similar molecular weight, such as the globular, soluble maltose-binding protein and the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin, which display moderate to weak coupling, respectively. The extracted mean square displacements also reveal a greater motional flexibility of IDP compared with globular, folded proteins and more restricted water motions on the IDP surface. The results provide evidence that protein and hydration-water motions mutually affect and shape each other, and that there is a gradient of coupling across different protein classes that may play a functional role in macromolecular activity in a cellular context.",

However, the experimental quantification of internal friction and its contribution to folding dynamics has remained challenging. Here we use the combination of single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer, nanosecond fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and microfluidic mixing to determine the reconfiguration times of unfolded proteins and investigate the mechanisms of internal friction contributing to their dynamics. Using concepts from polymer dynamics, we determine internal friction with three complementary, largely independent, and consistent approaches as an additive contribution to the reconfiguration time of the unfolded state. We find that the magnitude of internal friction correlates with the compactness of the unfolded protein: its contribution dominates the reconfiguration time of approximately 100 ns of the compact unfolded state of a small cold shock protein under native conditions, but decreases for more expanded chains, and approaches zero both at high denaturant concentrations and in intrinsically disordered proteins that are expanded due to intramolecular charge repulsion. Our results suggest that internal friction in the unfolded state will be particularly relevant for the kinetics of proteins that fold in the microsecond range or faster. The low internal friction in expanded intrinsically disordered proteins may have implications for the dynamics of their interactions with cellular binding partners.",energetic roughness;Kramers theory;protein folding;Rouse model;single-molecule FRET

Here we review experimental and computational studies on the binding kinetics of IDPs. Experiments have yielded both the binding rate constants and the binding mechanisms, the latter via mutation and deletion studies and NMR techniques. Most computational studies have aimed at qualitative understanding of the binding rate constants or at mapping the free energy surfaces after the IDPs are engaged with their targets. The experiments and computation show that IDPs generally gain structures after they are engaged with their targets; that is, interactions with the targets facilitate the IDPs’ folding. It also seems clear that the initial contact of an IDP with the target is formed by just a segment, not the entire IDP. The docking of one segment to its sub-site followed by coalescing of other segments around the corresponding sub-sites emerges as a recurring feature in the binding of IDPs. Such a dock-and-coalesce model forms the basis for quantitative calculation of binding rate constants. For both disordered and ordered proteins, strong electrostatic attraction with their targets can enhance the binding rate constants by several orders of magnitude. There are now tremendous opportunities in narrowing the gap in our understanding of IDPs relative to ordered proteins with regard to binding kinetics.",

In most cases, intrinsic disorder manifests itself in segments or domains of an IDP, called intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), but fully disordered IDPs also exist. Although IDRs can be detected as missing residues in protein structures determined by X-ray crystallography, no protocol has been developed to identify IDRs from structures obtained by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Here, we propose a computational method to assign IDRs based on NMR structures. We compared missing residues of X-ray structures with residue-wise deviations of NMR structures for identical proteins, and derived a threshold deviation that gives the best correlation of ordered and disordered regions of both structures. The obtained threshold of 3.2 Å was applied to proteins whose structures were only determined by NMR, and the resulting IDRs were analyzed and compared to those of X-ray structures with no NMR counterpart in terms of sequence length, IDR fraction, protein function, cellular location, and amino acid composition, all of which suggest distinct characteristics. The structural knowledge of IDPs is still inadequate compared with that of structured proteins.

However, the frequent requirement of peptide folding in specific interactions of IDPs could impose a kinetic bottleneck, which could be overcome only by efficient folding upon encounter. Intriguingly, existing kinetic data suggest that specific binding of IDPs is generally no slower than that of globular proteins. Here, we exploited the cell cycle regulator p27Kip1 (p27) as a model system to understand how IDPs might achieve efficient folding upon encounter for facile recognition. Combining experiments and coarse-grained modeling, we demonstrate that long-range electrostatic interactions between enriched charges on p27 and near its binding site on cyclin A not only enhance the encounter rate (i.e., electrostatic steering), but also promote folding-competent topologies in the encounter complexes, allowing rapid subsequent formation of short-range native interactions en route to the specific complex. In contrast, nonspecific hydrophobic interactions, while hardly affecting the encounter rate, can significantly reduce the efficiency of folding upon encounter and lead to slower binding kinetics. Further analysis of charge distributions in a set of known IDP complexes reveals that, although IDP binding sites tend to be more hydrophobic compared to the rest of the target surface, their vicinities are frequently enriched with charges to complement those on IDPs. This observation suggests that electrostatically accelerated encounter and induced folding might represent a prevalent mechanism for promoting facile IDP recognition.",

Our understanding of how intrinsic disorder mediates biological function is, however, incomplete. Here, we review disorder-mediated cell cycle regulation by two intrinsically disordered proteins, p21 and p27. A structural adaptation mechanism involving a stretchable, dynamic linker helix allows p21 to promiscuously recognize the various Cdk/cyclin complexes that regulate cell division. Disorder within p27 mediates transmission of an N-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation signal to a C-terminal threonine phosphorylation, constituting a signaling conduit. These mechanisms are mediated by folding upon binding p21/p27’s regulatory targets. However, residual disorder within the bound state contributes critically to these functional mechanisms. Our studies provide insights into how intrinsic protein disorder mediates regulatory processes and provide opportunities for designing drugs that target cancer-associated IDPs.",Cell cycle regulator;intrinsically disordered proteins;p21;p27;tyrosine phosphorylation

","Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and proteins with long disordered regions are highly abundant in various proteomes. Despite their lack of well-defined ordered structure, these proteins and regions are frequently involved in crucial biological processes. Although in recent years these proteins have attracted the attention of many researchers, IDPs represent a significant challenge for structural characterization since these proteins can impact many of the processes in the structure determination pipeline. Here we investigate the effects of IDPs on the structure determination process and the utility of disorder prediction in selecting and improving proteins for structural characterization. Examination of the extent of intrinsic disorder in existing crystal structures found that relatively few protein crystal structures contain extensive regions of intrinsic disorder. Although intrinsic disorder is not the only cause of crystallization failures and many structured proteins cannot be crystallized, filtering out highly disordered proteins from structure-determination target lists is still likely to be cost effective. Therefore it is desirable to avoid highly disordered proteins from structure-determination target lists and we show that disorder prediction can be applied effectively to enrich structure determination pipelines with proteins more likely to yield crystal structures. For structural investigation of specific proteins, disorder prediction can be used to improve targets for structure determination. Finally, a framework for considering intrinsic disorder in the structure determination pipeline is proposed.",Proteomics;Structural genomics;Structural proteomics;Intrinsically disordered protein

Intrinsically disordered regions that undergo a stimulus-dependent disorder-to-order transition are common to a large number of signaling proteins. However, little is known about the functionality of intrinsically disordered regions in plant proteins. Here we investigated intrinsic disorder in a plant-specific remorin protein that has been described as a signaling component in plant-microbe interactions. Using bioinformatic, biochemical, and biophysical approaches, we characterized the highly abundant remorin AtREM1.3, showing that its N-terminal region is intrinsically disordered. Although only the AtREM1.3 C-terminal domain is essential for stable homo-oligomerization, the N-terminal region facilitates this interaction. Furthermore, we confirmed the stable interaction between AtREM1.3 and four isoforms of the importin α protein family in a yeast two-hybrid system and by an in planta bimolecular fluorescent complementation assay. Phosphorylation of Ser-66 in the intrinsically disordered N-terminal region decreases the interaction strength with the importin α proteins. Hence, the N-terminal region may constitute a regulatory domain, stabilizing these interactions.",Intrinsically Disordered Proteins;Membrane Proteins;Plant Biochemistry;Protein Phosphorylation;Protein-Protein Interactions;Signaling;Remorin

Pih1 and the R2TP complex are required for the box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) assembly and ribosomal RNA processing. Purified Pih1 tends to aggregate in vitro. Molecular chaperone Hsp90 and its cochaperone Tah1 are required for the stability of Pih1 in vivo. We had shown earlier that the C terminus of Pih1 destabilizes the protein and that the C terminus of Tah1 binds to the Pih1 C terminus to form a stable complex. Here, we analyzed the secondary structure of the Pih1 C terminus and identified two intrinsically disordered regions and five hydrophobic clusters. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that one predicted intrinsically disordered region IDR2 is involved in Tah1 binding, and that the C terminus of Pih1 contains multiple destabilization or degron elements. Additionally, the Pih1 N-terminal domain, Pih11–230, was found to be able to complement the physiological role of full-length Pih1 at 37 °C. Pih11–230 as well as a shorter Pih1 N-terminal fragment Pih11–195 is able to bind Rvb1/Rvb2 heterocomplex. However, the sequence between the two disordered regions in Pih1 significantly enhances the Pih1 N-terminal domain binding to Rvb1/Rvb2.

To help in this endeavor, several Protein Structure Initiative Centers were asked to send samples of both crystallizable proteins and proteins that failed to crystallize. The abundance of intrinsic disorder in these proteins was evaluated via computational analysis using Predictors of Natural Disordered Regions (PONDR®) and the potential cleavage sites and corresponding fragments were determined. Then, the target proteins were analyzed for intrinsic disorder by their resistance to limited proteolysis. The rates of tryptic digestion of sample target proteins were compared to those of lysozyme/myoglobin, apo-myoglobin and α-casein as standards of ordered, partially disordered and completely disordered proteins, respectively. At the next stage, the protein samples were subjected to both far-UV and near-UV circular dichroism (CD) analysis. For most of the samples, a good agreement between CD data, predictions of disorder and the rates of limited tryptic digestion was established.

However, the mechanisms by which such intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) recognize their targets are not well understood. Here, we report the first experimental investigation of the interaction kinetics of the nuclear co-activator binding domain of CREB-binding protein and the activation domain from the p160 transcriptional co-activator for thyroid hormone and retinoid receptors. Both protein domains are intrinsically disordered in the free state and synergistically fold upon binding each other. Using the stopped-flow technique, we found that the binding reaction is fast, with an association rate constant of 3 × 107
m−1 s−1 at 277 K. Mutation of a conserved buried intermolecular salt bridge showed that electrostatics govern the rapid association. Furthermore, upon mutation of the salt bridge or at high salt concentration, an additional kinetic phase was detected (∼20 and ∼40 s−1, respectively, at 277 K), suggesting that the salt bridge may steer formation of the productive bimolecular complex in an intramolecular step. Finally, we directly measured slow kinetics for the IDP domains (∼1 s−1 at 277 K) related to conformational transitions upon binding. Together, the experiments demonstrate that the interaction involves several steps and accumulation of intermediate states. Our data are consistent with an induced fit mechanism, in agreement with previous simulations. We propose that the slow transitions may be a consequence of the multipartner interactions of IDPs.",Kinetics;Protein Domains;Protein Folding;Protein Stability;Protein-Protein Interactions;Binding Mechanism;Coupled Folding and Binding;Intrinsically Disordered Proteins

In one-to-many binding, a single MoRF binds to two or more different partners individually. MoRF-based one-to-many protein–protein interaction (PPI) examples were collected from the Protein Data Bank, yielding 23 MoRFs bound to 2–9 partners, with all pairs of same-MoRF partners having less than 25% sequence identity. Of these, 8 MoRFs were bound to 2–9 partners having completely different folds, whereas 15 MoRFs were bound to 2–5 partners having the same folds but with low sequence identities. For both types of partner variation, backbone and side chain torsion angle rotations were used to bring about the conformational changes needed to enable close fits between a single MoRF and distinct partners. Alternative splicing events (ASEs) and posttranslational modifications (PTMs) were also found to contribute to distinct partner binding. Because ASEs and PTMs both commonly occur in disordered regions, and because both ASEs and PTMs are often tissue-specific, these data suggest that MoRFs, ASEs, and PTMs may collaborate to alter PPI networks in different cell types. These data enlarge the set of carefully studied MoRFs that use inherent flexibility and that also use ASE-based and/or PTM-based surface modifications to enable the same disordered segment to selectively associate with two or more partners. The small number of residues involved in MoRFs and in their modifications by ASEs or PTMs may simplify the evolvability of signaling network diversity.",molecular recognition feature;MoRF;linear motif;hub protein;binding site;protein–protein interaction;intrinsically disordered protein

They probably facilitate cellular signal transduction by direct interaction with signaling proteins such as receptor-like kinases and may dynamically modulate their lateral segregation within plasma membranes. Recent evidence suggests such functions of remorins during plant–microbe interactions and innate immune responses, where differential phosphorylation of some of these proteins has been described to be dependent on the perception of the microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) flg22 and the presence of the NBS–LRR resistance protein RPM1. A number of specifically phosphorylated residues in their highly variable and intrinsically disordered N-terminal regions have been identified. Sequence diversity of these evolutionary distinct domains suggests that remorins may serve a wide range of biological functions.

Analysis of NMR secondary chemical shifts plays an important role in such studies, but the output of such analyses depends on the accuracy of reference random coil chemical shifts. Although uniform perdeuteration of IDPs can dramatically increase spectral resolution, a feature particularly important for the poorly dispersed IDP spectra, the impact of deuterium isotope shifts on random coil values has not yet been fully characterized. Very precise 2H isotope shift measurements for 13Cα, 13Cβ, 13C’, 15N, and 1HN have been obtained by using a mixed sample of protonated and uniformly perdeuterated -synuclein, a protein with chemical shifts exceptionally close to random coil values. Decomposition of these isotope shifts into one-bond, two-bond and three-bond effects as well as intra- and sequential residue contributions shows that such an analysis, which ignores conformational dependence, is meaningful but does not fully describe the total isotope shift to within the precision of the measurements. Random coil 2H isotope shifts provide an important starting point for analysis of such shifts in structural terms in folded proteins, where they are known to depend strongly on local geometry.",chemical shift;IDP;IUP;protein NMR;2H;random coil;triple resonance NMR

Although a wide variety of roles for protein disorder have been proposed, establishing that disorder is functionally important, particularly in vivo, is not a trivial task. Several molecular chaperones have now been identified as conditionally disordered proteins; fully folded and chaperone-inactive under non-stress conditions, they adopt a partially disordered conformation upon exposure to distinct stress-conditions. This disorder appears to be vital for their ability to bind multiple aggregation-sensitive client proteins and to protect cells against the stressors. The study of these conditionally disordered chaperones should prove useful in understanding the functional role for protein disorder in molecular recognition.",

CKIs perform their inhibitory effect by the formation of ternary complexes with a target kinase and its cognate cyclin. These regulators generally belong to the class of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which lack a well-defined and organized three-dimensional (3D) structure in their free state, undergoing folding upon binding to specific partners. Unbound IDPs are not merely random-coil structures, but can present intrinsically folded structural units (IFSUs) and collapsed conformations. These structural features can be relevant to protein function in vivo. The yeast CKI Sic1 is a 284-amino acid IDP that binds to Cdk1 in complex with the Clb5,6 cyclins, preventing phosphorylation of G1 substrates and, therefore, entrance to the S phase. Sic1 degradation, triggered by multiple phosphorylation events, promotes cell-cycle progression. Previous experimental studies pointed out a propensity of Sic1 and its isolated domains to populate both extended and compact conformations. The present contribution provides models for compact conformations of the Sic1 kinase-inhibitory domain (KID) by all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit solvent and in the absence of interactors. The results are integrated by spectroscopic and spectrometric data. Helical IFSUs are identified, along with networks of intramolecular interactions. The results identify a group of putative hub residues and networks of electrostatic interactions, which are likely to be involved in the stabilization of the globular states.",intrinsically disordered proteins;Sic1;electrostatic interactions;cyclin-dependent kinase;molecular dynamics simulations;electrospray ionization mass spectrometry

If an IDP could somehow be divided into smaller fragments and reconstructed later, theoretical and spectroscopic studies could probe its conformational variability in detail. Here, we used replica molecular-dynamics simulations and network theory to explore whether such a divide-and-conquer strategy is feasible for α-synuclein, a prototypical IDP. We characterized the conformational variability of α-synuclein by conducting >100 unbiased all-atom molecular-dynamics simulations, for a total of >10 μs of trajectories. In these simulations, α-synuclein formed a heterogeneous ensemble of collapsed coil states in an aqueous environment. These states were stabilized by heterogeneous contacts between sequentially distant regions. We find that α-synuclein contains residual secondary structures in the collapsed states, and the heterogeneity in the collapsed state makes it feasible to split α-synuclein into sequentially contiguous minimally interacting fragments. This study reveals previously unknown characteristics of α-synuclein and provides a new (to our knowledge) approach for studying other IDPs.",

While disordered in their unbound states, IDPs often, but not always, fold upon binding with their protein interaction partners. Here, we discuss how a class of IDPs directs the targeting, specificity and activity of Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1). PP1 is major ser/thr phosphatase that plays a critical role in a broad range of biological processes, from muscle contraction to memory formation. In the cell, PP1 is regulated through its interaction with more than 200 regulatory proteins, the majority of which are IDPs. Critically, these PP1:regulatory protein holoenzyme complexes confer specificity to PP1 and are thus the functional forms of the PP1 enzyme in vivo. Furthermore, we discuss the distinct modes of interaction utilized by IDPs to complex with their protein binding partners. We subsequently show, by integrating multiple biophysical tools, that the majority of IDPs that regulate PP1, prefer a conformational selection model.",Intrinsically disordered proteins;proteins;protein phosphatase 1;folding

Understanding the conformational characteristics of the monomeric state of α-synuclein is necessary for understanding the role of the monomer conformation in aggregation. Polymer theories have been applied to investigate the statistical properties of homopolymeric IDPs. Here we use Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (REMD) simulations using temperature as a proxy for solvent quality to examine how well these theories developed for homopolymeric chains describe heteropolymeric α-synuclein. Our results indicate that α-synuclein behaves like a homopolymer at the extremes of solvent quality, while in the intermediate solvent regime, the uneven distribution of charged residues along the sequence strongly influences the conformations adopted by the chain. We refine the ensemble extracted from the REMD simulations of α-synuclein, which shows the best qualitative agreement with experiment, by fitting to the experimental NMR Residual Dipolar Couplings (RDCs) and Paramagnetic Relaxation Enhancements (PREs).

By extending away from the partner and sweeping out large molecules, EBs can enable the target protein to fold free from interference. Using both naturally-occurring and artificial polypeptides we demonstrate the successful implementation of intrinsically disordered fusions as protein solubilizers. The artificial fusions discussed herein have low sequence complexity and high net charge, but are diversified by means of distinctive amino acid compositions and lengths. Using 6xHis fusions as controls, soluble protein expression enhancements from 65% (EB60A) to 100% (EB250) were observed for a 20-protein portfolio. Additionally, these EBs were able to more effectively solubilize targets compared to frequently-used fusions such as maltose-binding-protein, glutathione S-transferase, thioredoxin, and N utilization substance A. Finally, although these EBs possess very distinct physio-chemical properties they did not perturb the structure, conformational stability nor function of the green fluorescent protein or the glutathione S-transferase protein. This work thus illustrates the successful de novo design of intrinsically-disordered fusions, and presents a promising technology and complementary resource for researchers attempting to solubilize recalcitrant proteins.",intrinsic disorder;protein;solubility;aggregation;translational fusion

Like other steroid hormone receptors, the regulation of target genes by GR is mediated by two transactivation domains: activation function 1 (AF1) in the N-terminal domain and AF2 in the C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD). Full receptor activity requires both AF1 and -2 plus assorted coregulatory proteins. Crystal structures of the ligand-bound LBD have provided insight regarding how AF2 interacts with specific coactivators. However, despite its being the major activation domain of GRs, knowledge of AF1 structure/function has languished. This is mainly because of the highly disorganized structure of the GR N-terminal domain. This lack of AF1 structure is shared by all members of the steroid/nuclear receptor superfamily for which it has been examined and AF1 is thought to allow productive interactions with assorted cofactors via protein-induced changes in secondary/tertiary structures. To date, there are no reports of a classical coactivator altering the secondary/tertiary structure of the GR AF1 domain. Earlier, we reported an N-terminal fragment of the p160 coactivator TIF2, called TIF2.0, that binds the GR N-terminal domain and alters GR transcriptional activity. We therefore proposed that TIF2.0 binding to AF1 changes both its conformation and transcriptional activity. We now report that TIF2.0 interacts with the GR AF1 domain to increase the amount of α-helical structure in the complex. Furthermore, TIF2 coactivator activity is observed in the absence of the GR LBD in a manner that requires the AF1 domain. This contrasts with previous models where TIF2 receptor interaction domains binding to GR LBD somehow alter AF1 conformation. Our results establish for the first time that coactivators can modify the structure of the AF1 domain directly via the binding of a second region of the coactivator and suggest a molecular explanation for how coactivators increase the transcriptional activity of GR-agonist complexes.",Glucocorticoid Receptor;Intrinsically Disordered Proteins;Protein Folding;Steroid Hormone Receptor;Transcription Coactivators

Current efforts in interdisciplinary protein modeling are in their infancy and the state-of-the art of such models is described. Beyond the relationship between amino acid substitution and static protein structure, protein function, and corresponding organismal fitness, other considerations are also discussed. More complex mutational processes such as insertion and deletion and domain rearrangements and even circular permutations should be evaluated. The role of intrinsically disordered proteins is still controversial, but may be increasingly important to consider. Protein geometry and protein dynamics as a deviation from static considerations of protein structure are also important. Protein expression level is known to be a major determinant of evolutionary rate and several considerations including selection at the mRNA level and the role of interaction specificity are discussed. Lastly, the relationship between modeling and needed high-throughput experimental data as well as experimental examination of protein evolution using ancestral sequence resurrection and in vitro biochemistry are presented, towards an aim of ultimately generating better models for biological inference and prediction.",evolutionary modeling;domain evolution;sequence-structure-function relationships;protein dynamics;protein thermodynamics;gene duplication;protein expression;ancestral sequence reconstruction

The structural features of this key region of the supervillin polypeptide are unknown. Here, we utilize Circular Dichroism (CD) and bioinformatics sequence analysis to demonstrate that the N-terminal part of supervillin forms an extended intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Our combined data indicate that the N-terminus of human and bovine supervillin sequences (positions 1–830) represents an intrinsically disordered region, which is the largest IDR known to date in the villin/gelsolin family.

Their overexpression is toxic in many organisms, but the causes of toxicity are opaque. In this paper, we exploit yeast technologies to determine the root of toxicity for one such protein, the yeast prion Rnq1. This protein is profoundly toxic when overexpressed but only in cells carrying the endogenous Rnq1 protein in its [RNQ+] prion (amyloid) conformation. Surprisingly, toxicity was not caused by general proteotoxic stress. Rather, it involved a highly specific mitotic arrest mediated by the Mad2 cell cycle checkpoint. Monopolar spindles accumulated as a result of defective duplication of the yeast centrosome (spindle pole body [SPB]). This arose from selective Rnq1-mediated sequestration of the core SPB component Spc42 in the insoluble protein deposit (IPOD). Rnq1 does not normally participate in spindle pole dynamics, but it does assemble at the IPOD when aggregated. Our work illustrates how the promiscuous interactions of an intrinsically disordered protein can produce highly specific cellular toxicities through illicit, yet highly specific, interactions with the proteome.",

These +TIPs control microtubule dynamics and microtubule interactions with other intracellular structures. Here, we use cytoplasmic linker-associated protein 2 (CLASP2) binding to EB1 to determine how multisite phosphorylation regulates interactions with EB1. The central, intrinsically disordered region of vertebrate CLASP proteins contains two SXIP EB1 binding motifs that are required for EB1-mediated plus-end-tracking in vitro. In cells, both EB1 binding motifs can be functional, but most of the binding free energy results from nearby electrostatic interactions. By employing molecular dynamics simulations of the EB1 interaction with a minimal CLASP2 plus-end-tracking module, we find that conserved arginine residues in CLASP2 form extensive hydrogen-bond networks with glutamate residues predominantly in the unstructured, acidic C-terminal tail of EB1. Multisite phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) sites near the EB1 binding motifs disrupts this electrostatic “molecular Velcro.” Molecular dynamics simulations and 31P NMR spectroscopy indicate that phosphorylated serines participate in intramolecular interactions with and sequester arginine residues required for EB1 binding. Multisite phosphorylation of these GSK3 motifs requires priming phosphorylation by interphase or mitotic cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and we find that CDK- and GSK3-dependent phosphorylation completely disrupts CLASP2 microtubule plus-end-tracking in mitosis.",CDK (Cyclin-dependent Kinase);Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3;Intrinsically Disordered Proteins;Microtubules;Mitosis;Molecular Dynamics;CLASP2;EB1;Multisite Phosphorylation

Photocrosslinking methods rely on use of metabolic engineering or genetic code expansion to incorporate photocrosslinking analogs of amino acids or sugars into cellular biomolecules. Immunological and mass spectrometry techniques are used to analyze crosslinked complexes, thereby defining specific interactomes. Because photocrosslinking can be conducted in native, cellular settings, it can be used to define context-dependent interactions. Photocrosslinking methods are also ideally suited for determining interactome dynamics, mapping interaction interfaces, and identifying transient interactions in which intrinsically disordered proteins and glycoproteins engage.

In particular, we focus on two sequences, one with 16 and one with 35 amino acids, which make a stable dimeric three-helix bundle at low temperatures. Three distinct binding mechanisms are realized by altering the stabilities of the individual monomers: docking, coupled folding-binding of a single α-helix, and synergistic folding and binding. Compared to docking, the free-energy barrier for binding is reduced when the single α-helix is allowed to fold upon binding, but only marginally. A greater reduction is found for synergistic folding, which in addition results in a binding transition state characterized by very few interchain contacts. Disordered flanking chain segments attached to the α-helix sequence can, despite a negligible impact on the dimer stability, lead to a downhill free-energy surface in which the barrier for binding is eliminated.",

Activation of Hsp33 is triggered by the oxidative unfolding of its own redox-sensor domain, making Hsp33 a member of a recently discovered class of chaperones that require partial unfolding for full chaperone activity. Here we address the long-standing question of how chaperones recognize client proteins. We show that Hsp33 uses its own intrinsically disordered regions to discriminate between unfolded and partially structured folding intermediates. Binding to secondary structure elements in client proteins stabilizes Hsp33’s intrinsically disordered regions, and this stabilization appears to mediate Hsp33’s high affinity for structured folding intermediates. Return to nonstress conditions reduces Hsp33’s disulfide bonds, which then significantly destabilizes the bound client proteins and in doing so converts them into less-structured, folding-competent client proteins of ATP-dependent foldases. We propose a model in which energy-independent chaperones use internal order-to-disorder transitions to control substrate binding and release.",

The redox switch CP12 is an intrinsically disordered protein that can form two disulfide bridges. In the dark oxidized CP12 forms an inactive supramolecular complex with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and phosphoribulokinase, two enzymes of the carbon assimilation cycle. Here we show that binding of CP12 to GAPDH, the first step of ternary complex formation, follows an integrated mechanism that combines conformational selection with induced folding steps. Initially, a CP12 conformation characterized by a circular structural motif including the C-terminal disulfide is selected by GAPDH. Subsequently, the induced folding of the flexible C-terminal tail of CP12 in the active site of GAPDH stabilizes the binary complex. Formation of several hydrogen bonds compensates the entropic cost of CP12 fixation and terminates the interaction mechanism that contributes to carbon assimilation control.",Disulfide;Photosynthesis;Protein Dynamics;Protein-Protein Interactions;X-ray Crystallography;Calvin-Benson Cycle;GAPDH-CP12 Binary Complex;Intrinsically Disordered Proteins

To date, little is known about the presumed redox activity of VIMP, its structure and how these features might relate to the function of the protein in ERAD. Here, we use the recombinantly expressed cytosolic region of VIMP where the selenocysteine (Sec) in position 188 is replaced with a cysteine (a construct named cVIMP-Cys) to characterize redox and structural properties of the protein. We show that Cys-188 in cVIMP-Cys forms a disulfide bond with Cys-174, consistent with the presence of a Cys174-Sec188 selenosulfide bond in the native sequence. For the disulfide bond in cVIMP-Cys we determined the reduction potential to −200 mV, and showed it to be a good substrate of thioredoxin. Based on a biochemical and structural characterization of cVIMP-Cys using analytical gel filtration, CD and NMR spectroscopy in conjunction with bioinformatics, we propose a comprehensive overall structural model for the cytosolic region of VIMP. The data clearly indicate the N-terminal half to be comprised of two extended α-helices followed by a C-terminal region that is intrinsically disordered. Redox-dependent conformational changes in cVIMP-Cys were observed only in the vicinity of the two Cys residues. Overall, the redox properties observed for cVIMP-Cys are compatible with a function as a reductase, and we speculate that the plasticity of the intrinsically disordered C-terminal region allows the protein to access many different and structurally diverse substrates.",Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress;Endoplasmic Reticulum(ER);Protein Degradation;Protein Misfolding;Redox;Endoplasmic Reticulum-associated Degradation (ERAD);Selenoprotein S (SelS);VCP-interacting Membrane Protein (VIMP);p97

Kinesin motor domains, which hydrolyze ATP to produce a directed mechanical force along a microtubule, are well conserved throughout the entire superfamily. Outside of the motor domains, kinesin sequences diverge along with their transport functions. The non-motor regions, particularly the tails, respond to a wide variety of structural and molecular cues that enable kinesins to carry specific cargoes in response to particular cellular signals. Here, we demonstrate that intrinsic disorder is a common structural feature of kinesins. A bioinformatics survey of the full-length sequences of all 43 human kinesins predicts that significant regions of intrinsically disordered residues are present in all kinesins. These regions are concentrated in the non-motor domains, particularly in the tails and near sites for ligand binding or post-translational modifications. In order to experimentally verify these predictions, we expressed and purified the tail domains of kinesins representing three different families (Kif5B, Kif10, and KifC3). Circular dichroism (CD) and NMR spectroscopy experiments demonstrate that the isolated tails are disordered in vitro, yet they retain their functional microtubule-binding activity. Based on these results, we propose that intrinsic disorder is a common structural feature that confers functional specificity to kinesins.",kinesin;tail domain;structure prediction;intrinsic disorder;circular dichroism;NMR spectroscopy

A number of these IDPs have been shown to undergo coupled folding and binding reactions whereby they can gain structure upon association with an appropriate partner protein. In general, these systems display weaker binding affinities than do systems with association between completely structured domains, with micromolar Kd values appearing typical. One such system is the association between α- and β-spectrin, where two partially structured, incomplete domains associate to form a fully structured, three-helix bundle, the spectrin tetramerization domain. Here, we use this model system to demonstrate a method for fitting association and dissociation kinetic traces where, using typical biophysical concentrations, the association reactions are expected to be highly reversible. We elucidate the unusually slow, two-state kinetics of spectrin assembly in solution. The advantages of studying kinetics in this regime include the potential for gaining equilibrium constants as well as rate constants, and for performing experiments with low protein concentrations. We suggest that this approach would be particularly appropriate for high-throughput mutational analysis of two-state reversible binding processes.",

An essential PcG complex, PRC1, compacts chromatin and inhibits chromatin remodeling. In Drosophila melanogaster, the intrinsically disordered C-terminal region of PSC (PSC-CTR) mediates these noncovalent effects on chromatin, and is essential for viability. Because the PSC-CTR sequence is poorly conserved, the significance of its effects on chromatin outside of Drosophila was unclear. The absence of folded domains also made it difficult to understand how the sequence of PSC-CTR encodes its function. To determine the mechanistic basis and extent of conservation of PSC-CTR activity, we identified 17 metazoan PSC-CTRs spanning chordates to arthropods, and examined their sequence features and biochemical properties. PSC-CTR sequences are poorly conserved, but are all highly charged and structurally disordered. We show that active PSC-CTRs—which bind DNA tightly and inhibit chromatin remodeling efficiently—are distinguished from less active ones by the absence of extended negatively charged stretches. PSC-CTR activity can be increased by dispersing its contiguous negative charge, confirming the importance of this property. Using the sequence properties defined as important for PSC-CTR activity, we predicted the presence of active PSC-CTRs in additional diverse genomes. Our analysis reveals broad conservation of PSC-CTR activity across metazoans. This conclusion could not have been determined from sequence alignments. We further find that plants that lack active PSC-CTRs instead possess a functionally analogous PcG protein, EMF1. Thus, our study suggests that a disordered domain with dispersed negative charges underlies PRC1 activity, and is conserved across metazoans and plants.",intrinsically disordered protein;protein evolution

The fundamental premise of classical models that describe allostery is that structure mediates ‘action at a distance’. Recently, this paradigm has been challenged by the enrichment of IDPs (intrinsically disordered proteins) or ID (intrinsically disordered) segments in transcription factors and signalling pathways of higher organisms, where an allosteric response from external signals is requisite for regulated function. This observation strongly suggests that IDPs elicit the capacity for finely tunable allosteric regulation. Is there a set of transferable ground rules that reconcile these disparate allosteric phenomena? We focus on findings from the human GR (glucocorticoid receptor) which is a nuclear transcription factor in the SHR (steroid hormone receptor) family. GR contains an intrinsically disordered NTD (N-terminal domain) that is obligatory for transcription activity. Different GR translational isoforms have various lengths of NTD and by studying these isoforms we found that the full-length ID NTD consists of two thermodynamically distinct coupled regions. The data are interpreted in the context of an EAM (ensemble allosteric model) that considers only the intrinsic and measurable energetics of allosteric systems. Expansion of the EAM is able to reconcile the paradox that ligands for SHRs can be agonists and antagonists in a cell-context-dependent manner. These findings suggest a mechanism by which SHRs in particular, and IDPs in general, may have evolved to couple thermodynamically distinct ID segments. The ensemble view of allostery that is illuminated provides organizing principles to unify the description of all allosteric systems and insight into ‘how’ allostery works.",allostery;conformational fluctuation;ensemble;glucocorticoid receptor;intrinsic disorder;protein stability

Osmolytes are small-molecule compounds that can act as chemical chaperones by altering the environment in a cellular context. Despite their importance, detailed studies on the role of these chemical chaperones in modulating structure and dimensions of intrinsically disordered proteins have been limited. Here, we used single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer to test the counteraction hypothesis of counterbalancing effects between the protecting osmolyte trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) and denaturing osmolyte urea for the case of α-synuclein, a Parkinson’s disease-linked protein whose monomer exhibits significant disorder. The single-molecule experiments, which avoid complications from protein aggregation, do not exhibit clear solvent-induced cooperative protein transitions for these osmolytes, unlike results from previous studies on globular proteins. Our data demonstrate the ability of TMAO and urea to shift α-synuclein structures towards either more compact or expanded average dimensions. Strikingly, the experiments directly reveal that a 2∶1 [urea]∶[TMAO] ratio has a net neutral effect on the protein’s dimensions, a result that holds regardless of the absolute osmolyte concentrations. Our findings shed light on a surprisingly simple aspect of the interplay between urea and TMAO on α-synuclein in the context of intrinsically disordered proteins, with potential implications for the biological roles of such chemical chaperones. The results also highlight the strengths of single-molecule experiments in directly probing the chemical physics of protein structure and disorder in more chemically complex environments.",Parkinson’s disease;protein folding;urea-TMAO counteraction;smFRET

Using this method we show that the isolated AD1 and AD2 binding motifs, derived from the intrinsically disordered N-terminal transactivation domain of the tumor suppressor p53, both interact with the TAZ2 domain of the transcriptional coactivator CBP at two binding sites. Simulations of titration curves and lineshapes show that a primary dissociation constant as small as 1~10 nM can be accurately estimated by NMR titration methods, provided that the primary and secondary binding processes are coupled. Unexpectedly, the site of binding of AD2 on the hydrophobic surface of TAZ2 overlaps with the binding site for AD1, but AD2 binds TAZ2 more tightly. The results highlight the complexity of interactions between intrinsically disordered proteins and their targets. Furthermore, the association rate of AD2 to TAZ2 is estimated to be 1.7 × 1010 M−1 s−1, approaching the diffusion-controlled limit and indicating that intrinsic disorder plus complementary electrostatics can significantly accelerate protein binding interactions.",

These proteins are dynein, a large motor complex that moves machinery inside cells, and two of its regulators: a protein complex called dynactin, that is a dynein activator, and a protein called NudE whose depletion in mice produces a small brain and mental retardation. What is intriguing about the dynein/dynactin/NudE interplay is that dynactin and NudE bind to a common segment of dynein that is intrinsically disordered. Elucidating differences in their binding modes may explain how one regulator can be selected over the other even when both are present in the same cellular compartment. These results have far reaching impact not only in our understanding of processes essential for formation and orientation of the spindle but also offer a novel role for protein disorder in controlling cellular processes, and highlight the advantages of NMR spectroscopy in elucidating atomic level characterization of extremely complex dynamic cellular assemblies.",

The predominant technology requires fast digestion at pH 2–3 to retain deuterium label. Pepsin is used almost exclusively, but it provides relatively low efficiency under the constraints of the experiment, and a selectivity profile that renders poor coverage of intrinsically disordered regions. In this study we present nepenthesin-containing secretions of the pitcher plant Nepenthes, commonly called monkey cups, for use in HDX-MS. We show that nepenthesin is at least 1400-fold more efficient than pepsin under HDX-competent conditions, with a selectivity profile that mimics pepsin in part, but also includes efficient cleavage C-terminal to “forbidden” residues K, R, H, and P. High efficiency permits a solution-based analysis with no detectable autolysis, avoiding the complication of immobilized enzyme reactors. Relaxed selectivity promotes high coverage of disordered regions and the ability to “tune” the mass map for regions of interest. Nepenthesin-enriched secretions were applied to an analysis of protein complexes in the nonhomologous end-joining DNA repair pathway. The analysis of XRCC4 binding to the BRCT domains of Ligase IV points to secondary interactions between the disordered C-terminal tail of XRCC4 and remote regions of the BRCT domains, which could only be identified with a nepenthesin-based workflow. HDX data suggest that stalk-binding to XRCC4 primes a BRCT conformation in these remote regions to support tail interaction, an event which may be phosphoregulated. We conclude that nepenthesin is an effective alternative to pepsin for all HDX-MS applications, and especially for the analysis of structural transitions among intrinsically disordered proteins and their binding partners.",

However, how these proteins direct the specificity of PP1 is not well understood. More than 1/3 of the nuclear pool of PP1 forms a holoenzyme with the nuclear inhibitor of PP1, NIPP1, to regulate chromatin remodeling, among other essential biological functions. Here, we show that the PP1-binding domain of NIPP1 is an intrinsically disordered protein, which binds PP1 in an unexpected manner. NIPP1 forms an α-helix that engages PP1 at a novel interaction site, using polar rather than hydrophobic contacts. Importantly, the structure also reveals the first shared PP1 interaction site outside of the RVxF motif, the ΦΦ motif. Finally, we show that NIPP1:PP1 substrate selectivity is determined by altered electrostatics and enhanced substrate localization. Together, our results provide the molecular basis by which NIPP1 directs PP1 substrate specificity in the nucleus.",protein phosphatase 1 (PP1);structural biology;enzyme regulation;enzyme specificity;nuclear phosphatases

Dyn2 is proposed to dimerize and stabilize the Nup82-Nsp1-Nup159 complex of the nuclear pore assembly through its interaction with nucleoporin Nup159. Nup159 has six LC8 recognition motifs separated by short linkers. NMR experiments reported here show that the Dyn2 binding domain of Nup159 is intrinsically disordered and that binding of one equivalent of Dyn2 dimer aligns two Nup159 chains along the full Dyn2 binding domain to form a bivalent scaffold that promotes binding of other Dyn2 dimers. Isothermal titration calorimetry of Dyn2 binding to Nup constructs of increasing lengths determine that the third LC8 recognition motifs does not bind Dyn2. A new approach to identifying active LC8 recognition motifs based on NMR-detected β-sheet propensities is presented. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments also show that, due to unfavorable entropy changes, a Nup-Dyn2 complex with three Dyn2 dimers is more stable than the wild-type complex with five Dyn2 dimers. The calorimetric results argue that, from a thermodynamics perspective, only three Dyn2 dimers are needed for optimal stability and suggest that the evolutionary adaptation of multiple tandem LC8 recognition motifs imparts to the complex other properties such as rigidity and a kink in the rod-like structure.

We previously identified the cellular WD40 repeat-containing protein p80/UAF1 as a novel interaction partner of E1 from anogenital human papillomavirus (HPV) types. p80 was found to interact with the first 40 residues of HPV type 31 (HPV31) E1, and amino acid substitutions within this domain abrogated the maintenance of the viral episome in keratinocytes. In this study, we report that these p80-binding substitutions reduce by 70% the ability of E1 to support transient viral DNA replication without affecting its interaction with E2 and assembly at the origin in vivo. Microscopy studies revealed that p80 is relocalized from the cytoplasm to discrete subnuclear foci by E1 and E2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further revealed that p80 is recruited to the viral origin in an E1- and E2-dependent manner. Interestingly, overexpression of a 40-amino-acid-long p80-binding peptide, derived from HPV31 E1, was found to inhibit viral DNA replication by preventing the recruitment of endogenous p80 to the origin. Mutant peptides defective for p80 interaction were not inhibitory, demonstrating the specificity of this effect. Characterization of this E1 peptide by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) showed that it is intrinsically disordered in solution, while mapping studies indicated that the WD repeats of p80 are required for E1 interaction. These results provide additional evidence for the requirement for p80 in anogenital HPV DNA replication and highlight the potential of E1-p80 interaction as a novel antiviral target.",

The activity, stability and sub-cellular localization of p27 are regulated by phosphorylation. We illustrate how p27 integrates regulatory signals from several non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs) to activate Cdk4 and initiate cell cycle entry. Unmodified p27 potently inhibits Cdk/cyclin complexes, including Cdk4/cyclin D (IC50, 1 nM). Some NRTKs (e.g. Abl) phosphorylate p27 on Tyr 88, which facilitates a 2nd modification on Tyr 74 by another NRTK (e.g., Src). Importantly, this second modification causes partial reactivation of Cdk4 within ternary complexes containing doubly Tyr phosphorylated p27. Partial activation of Cdk4 initiates entry into the cell division cycle. Therefore, p27’s disordered features enable NRTKs to sequentially promote a phosphorylation cascade that controls cell fate. Beyond cell cycle control, these results illustrate general concepts regarding why IDPs are well-suited for roles in signaling and regulation in biological systems.",

A major class of disordered interaction interfaces are the compact and degenerate modules known as short linear motifs (SLiMs). As a result of the difficulties associated with the experimental identification and validation of SLiMs, our understanding of these modules is limited, advocating the use of computational methods to focus experimental discovery. This article evaluates the use of evolutionary conservation as a discriminatory technique for motif discovery. A statistical framework is introduced to assess the significance of relatively conserved residues, quantifying the likelihood a residue will have a particular level of conservation given the conservation of the surrounding residues. The framework is expanded to assess the significance of groupings of conserved residues, a metric that forms the basis of SLiMPrints (short linear motif fingerprints), a de novo motif discovery tool. SLiMPrints identifies relatively overconstrained proximal groupings of residues within intrinsically disordered regions, indicative of putatively functional motifs. Finally, the human proteome is analysed to create a set of highly conserved putative motif instances, including a novel site on translation initiation factor eIF2A that may regulate translation through binding of eIF4E.",

However, their structural characterization by traditional biophysical methods, for the purposes of understanding their function and dysfunction, has proved challenging. Here, we investigate the model IDPs α-Synuclein (αS) and tau, that are involved in major neurodegenerative conditions including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, using excluded volume Monte Carlo simulations constrained by pairwise distance distributions from single-molecule fluorescence measurements. Using this, to our knowledge, novel approach we find that a relatively small number of intermolecular distance constraints are sufficient to accurately determine the dimensions and polymer conformational statistics of αS and tau in solution. Moreover, this method can detect local changes in αS and tau conformations that correlate with enhanced aggregation. Constrained Monte Carlo simulations produce ensembles that are in excellent agreement both with experimental measurements on αS and tau and with all-atom, explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations of αS, with much lower configurational sampling requirements and computational expense.",AAMD;all-atom molecular dynamics; ECMC;experimentally constrained Monte Carlo; ETeff;energy transfer efficiency; (sm)FRET;(single molecule) Förster resonance energy transfer; IDP;intrinsically disordered protein; LJ;Lennard-Jones; MC;Monte Carlo; MD;molecular dynamics; PRE;paramagnetic relaxation enhancement; SAX(N)S;small-angle x-ray (neutron) scattering; UMC;unconstrained Monte Carlo

We performed all-atom multicanonical molecular dynamics simulations of pKID with and without KIX in explicit solvents to generate conformational ensembles. Although the unbound pKID was disordered overall, αA and αB exhibited a nascent helix propensity; the propensity of αA was stronger than that of αB, which agrees with experimental results. In the bound state, the free-energy landscape of αB involved two low free-energy fractions: native-like and non-native fractions. This result suggests that αB folds according to the induced-fit mechanism. The αB-helix direction was well aligned as in the NMR complex structure, although the αA helix exhibited high flexibility. These results also agree quantitatively with experimental observations. We have detected that the αB helix can bind to another site of KIX, to which another protein MLL also binds with the adopting helix.

The N-terminal region of c-Myc coordinates a wealth of protein interactions involved in transformation, differentiation and apoptosis. We have characterized in detail the intrinsically disordered properties of Myc-1–88, where hierarchical phosphorylation of S62 and T58 regulates activation and destruction of the Myc protein. By nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shift analysis, relaxation measurements and NOE analysis, we show that although Myc occupies a very heterogeneous conformational space, we find transiently structured regions in residues 22–33 and in the Myc homology box I (MBI; residues 45–65); both these regions are conserved in other members of the Myc family. Binding of Bin1 to Myc-1–88 as assayed by NMR and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) revealed primary binding to the S62 region in a dynamically disordered and multivalent complex, accompanied by population shifts leading to altered intramolecular conformational dynamics. These findings expand the increasingly recognized concept of intrinsically disordered regions mediating transient interactions to Myc, a key transcriptional regulator of major medical importance, and have important implications for further understanding its multifaceted role in gene regulation.",

Toretsky, ude.nwotegroeg@24taj","Oncogenic fusion proteins, such as EWS-FLI1, are excellent therapeutic targets as they are only located within the tumor. However, there are currently no agents targeted toward transcription factors, which are often considered to be ‘undruggable.’ A considerable body of evidence is accruing that refutes this claim based upon the intrinsic disorder of transcription factors. Our previous studies show that RNA Helicase A (RHA) enhances the oncogenesis of EWS-FLI1, a putative intrinsically disordered protein. Interruption of this protein-protein complex by small molecule inhibitors validates this interaction as a unique therapeutic target. Single enantiomer activity from a chiral compound has been recognized as strong evidence for specificity in a small molecule-protein interaction. Our compound, YK-4-279, has a chiral center and can be separated into two enantiomers by chiral HPLC. We show that there is a significant difference in activity between the two enantiomers. (S)-YK-4-279 is able to disrupt binding between EWS-FLI1 and RHA in an immunoprecipitation assay and blocks the transcriptional activity of EWS-FLI1, while (R)-YK-4-279 cannot. Enantiospecific effects are also established in cytotoxicity assays and caspase assays, where up to a log-fold difference is seen between (S)-YK-4-279 and the racemic YK-4-279. Our findings indicate that only one enantiomer of our small molecule is able to specifically target a protein-protein interaction. This work is significant for its identification of a single enantiomer effect upon a protein interaction suggesting that small molecule targeting of intrinsically disordered proteins can be specific. Furthermore, proving YK-4-279 has only one functional enantiomer will be helpful in moving this compound towards clinical trials.",YK-4-279;EWS-FLI1;RHA

Using multicanonical molecular dynamics (McMD) simulations with realistic expressions, i.e., all-atom protein models and an explicit solvent, free-energy landscapes have been computed for several systems, such as the folding of peptides/proteins composed of a few amino acids up to nearly 60 amino-acid residues, protein–ligand interactions, and coupled folding and binding of intrinsically disordered proteins. Recent progress in conformational sampling and its applications to biophysical systems are reviewed in this report, including descriptions of several outstanding studies. In addition, an algorithm and detailed procedures used for multicanonical sampling are presented along with the methodology of adaptive umbrella sampling. Both methods control the simulation so that low-probability regions along a reaction coordinate are sampled frequently. The reaction coordinate is the potential energy for multicanonical sampling and is a structural identifier for adaptive umbrella sampling. One might imagine that this probability control invariably enhances conformational transitions among distinct stable states, but this study examines the enhanced conformational sampling of a simple system and shows that reasonably well-controlled sampling slows the transitions. This slowing is induced by a rapid change of entropy along the reaction coordinate. We then provide a recipe to speed up the sampling by loosening the rapid change of entropy. Finally, we report all-atom McMD simulation results of various biophysical systems in an explicit solvent.",Molecular dynamics;Enhanced sampling;Generalized ensemble;Multicanonical;Canonical ensemble;Free-energy landscape

These traits are essential in signaling and regulation that require reversibility. Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) exploit this situation by commandeering host cytoskeletal signaling to stimulate actin assembly beneath bound bacteria, generating ‘pedestals’ that promote intestinal colonization. EHEC translocates into the host cell two proteins, EspFU and Tir, which form a complex with the host protein IRTKS. The interaction of this complex with N-WASP triggers localized actin polymerization. We show that EspFU is an IDP that contains a transiently α-helical N-terminus and dynamic C-terminus. Our structure shows that single EspFU repeat is capable of forming a high-affinity trimolecular complex with N-WASP and IRTKS. We demonstrate that bacterial and cellular ligands interact with IRTKS SH3 in a similar fashion but the bacterial protein has evolved to outcompete cellular targets by utilizing a tryptophan switch that offers superior binding affinity enabling EHEC-induced pedestal formation.",

Huntingtin, a large (347 kDa) protein containing multiple HEAT repeats, acts as a scaffold for protein-protein interactions. Huntingtin-induced toxicity is believed to be mediated by a conformational change in expanded huntingtin, leading to protein misfolding and aggregation, aberrant protein interactions and neuronal cell death. While many non-systematic studies of huntingtin interactions have been reported, they were not designed to identify and quantify the changes in the huntingtin interactome induced by polyglutamine expansion. We used tandem affinity purification and quantitative proteomics to compare and quantify interactions of normal or expanded huntingtin isolated from a striatal cell line. We found that proteins preferentially interacting with expanded huntingtin are enriched for intrinsically disordered proteins, consistent with previously suggested roles of such proteins in neurodegenerative disorders. Our functional analysis indicates that proteins related to energy production, protein trafficking, RNA post-transcriptional modifications and cell death were significantly enriched among preferential interactors of expanded huntingtin. Expanded huntingtin interacted with many mitochondrial proteins, including AIFM1, consistent with a role for mitochondrial dysfunction in HD. Furthermore, expanded huntingtin interacted with the stress granule-associated proteins Caprin-1 and G3BP and redistributed to RNA stress granules under ER-stress conditions. These data demonstrate that a number of key cellular functions and networks may be disrupted by abnormal interactions of expanded huntingtin and highlight proteins and pathways that may be involved in HD cellular pathogenesis and that may serve as therapeutic targets.",huntingtin;Huntington Disease mechanism;neurodegeneration;protein interactions;RNA processing

Because ID regions commonly fold as part of their intracellular function, it is crucial to understand the folded states as well as the transitions between the unfolded and folded states. Specifically, it is important to determine 1) whether large ID segments contain different thermodynamically and/or functionally distinct regions, 2) whether any ID regions fold upon activation, 3) the degree of coupling between the different ID regions, and 4) whether the stability of ID domains is a determinant of function. In this study, we thermodynamically characterized the full-length ID N-terminal domain (NTD) of human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and two of its naturally occurring translational isoforms. The protective osmolyte trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) was used to induce folding transitions. Each of the three NTD isoforms was found to undergo a cooperative folding transition that is thermodynamically indistinguishable (based on m-values) from that of a globular protein of similar size. The extrapolated stabilities for the NTD isoforms showed clear correlation with the known activities of their corresponding GR translational isoforms. The data reveal that the full-length NTD can be viewed as having at least two thermodynamically coupled regions, a functional region, which is indispensable for GR transcriptional activity, and a regulatory region, the length of which serves to regulate the stability of NTD and thus the activity of GR. These results suggest a new functional paradigm whereby steroid hormone receptors in particular and ID proteins in general can have multiple functionally distinct ID regions that interact and modulate the stability of important functional sites.",Allosteric Regulation;Intrinsically Disordered Proteins;Protein Folding;Signaling;Steroid Hormone Receptor;Ensemble;Thermodynamic Coupling

We searched for evolutionarily conserved sequences within disordered regions according to the hypothesis that conservation would indicate functional residues. Using a phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM), we made accurate, specific predictions of functional elements in disordered regions even when these elements are only two or three amino acids long. Among the conserved sequences that we identified were previously known and newly identified short linear motifs, and we experimentally verified key examples, including a motif that may mediate interaction between protein kinase Cbk1 and its substrates. We also observed that hub proteins, which interact with many partners in a protein interaction network, are highly enriched in these conserved sequences.

The NTAIL region involved in binding coupled to folding has been mapped to a conserved region (Box2) encompassing residues 489–506. In the previous studies published in this journal, we obtained experimental evidence supporting a KD for the NTAIL–XD binding reaction in the nM range and also showed that an additional NTAIL region (Box3, aa 517–525) plays a role in binding to XD. In striking contrast with these data, studies published in this journal by Kingston and coworkers pointed out a much less stable complex (KD in the μM range) and supported lack of involvement of Box3 in complex formation. The objective of this study was to critically re-evaluate the role of Box3 in NTAIL–XD binding. Since our previous studies relied on NTAIL-truncated forms possessing an irrelevant Flag sequence appended at their C-terminus, we, herein, generated an NTAIL devoid of Box3 and any additional C-terminal residues, as well as a form encompassing only residues 482–525. We then used isothermal titration calorimetry to characterize the binding reactions between XD and these NTAIL forms. Results effectively argue for the presence of a single XD-binding site located within Box2, in agreement with the results by Kingston et al., while providing clear experimental support for a high-affinity complex. Altogether, the present data provide mechanistic insights into the replicative machinery of MeV and clarify a hitherto highly debated point.",isothermal titration calorimetry;intrinsically disordered proteins;folding coupled to binding;entropic penalty;entropic stabilization;paramyxoviruses;nucleoprotein;phosphoprotein

Binding of P to nucleocapsid is mediated by the X domain of P (XD) and a conserved sequence (Box-2) within the C-terminal domain of the nucleoprotein (NTAIL). XD binding induces NTAIL α-helical folding, which in turn has been proposed to stabilize the polymerase-nucleocapsid complex, with cycles of binding and release required for transcription and genome replication. The current work directly assessed the relationships among XD-induced NTAIL folding, XD-NTAIL binding affinity, and polymerase activity. Amino acid substitutions that abolished XD-induced NTAIL α-helical folding were created within Box-2 of Edmonston MeV NTAIL. Polymerase activity in minireplicons was maintained despite a 35-fold decrease in XD-NTAIL binding affinity or reduction/loss of XD-induced NTAIL alpha-helical folding. Recombinant infectious virus was recovered for all mutants, and transcriptase elongation rates remained within a 1.7-fold range of parent virus. Box-2 mutations did however impose a significant cost to infectivity, reflected in an increase in the amount of input genome required to match the infectivity of parent virus. Diminished infectivity could not be attributed to changes in virion protein composition or production of defective interfering particles, where changes from parent virus were within a 3-fold range. The results indicated that MeV polymerase activity, but not infectivity, tolerates amino acid changes in the XD-binding region of the nucleoprotein. Selectional pressure for conservation of the Box-2 sequence may thus reflect a role in assuring the fidelity of polymerase functions or the assembly of viral particles required for optimal infectivity.",Intrinsically Disordered Proteins;Negative Strand RNA Viruses;Protein Complexes;Protein Conformation;Protein Structure;Induced Folding;Minireplicon;Nucleoprotein;Phosphoprotein;Reverse Genetics

Histone tails, which are the terminal segments of the histone proteins, are prominent IDPs that are implicated in a variety of signaling processes, which control chromatin organization and dynamics. Although a large body of work has been done on elucidating the roles of posttranslational modifications in functional regulation of IDPs, molecular mechanisms behind the observed behaviors are not fully understood. Using extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we found in this work that H4 tail mono-acetylation at LYS-16, which is a key covalent modification, induces a significant reorganization of the tail’s conformational landscape, inducing partial ordering and enhancing the propensity for alpha-helical segments. Furthermore, our calculations of the potentials of mean force between the H4 tail and a DNA fragment indicate that contrary to the expectations based on simple electrostatic reasoning, the Lys-16 mono-acetylated H4 tail binds to DNA stronger than the unacetylated protein. Based on these results, we propose a molecular mechanism for the way Lys-16 acetylation might lead to experimentally observed disruption of compact chromatin fibers.",histone tails;atomistic simulations;polyelectrolytes

We determined the structure of the AF9 AHD in complex with the elongation factor AF4, and show that aliphatic residues which are conserved in each of the AF9 binding partners form an integral part of the hydrophobic core of the complex.

When reconfiguration is fast, bimolecular association is not stable, but as reconfiguration slows, association is more stable and subsequent aggregation is faster. To investigate this hypothesis, we have measured the rate of intramolecular diffusion in α-synuclein, a protein involved in Parkinson’s disease, under solvent conditions that accelerate or decelerate aggregation. Using the method of tryptophan-cysteine (Trp-Cys) quenching, the rate of intramolecular contact is measured in four different loops along the chain length. This intrinsically disordered protein is highly diffusive at low temperature at neutral pH, when aggregation is slow, and compacts and diffuses more slowly at high temperature or low pH, when aggregation is rapid. Diffusion also slows with the disease mutation A30P. This work provides unique insights into the earliest steps of α-synuclein aggregation pathway and should provide the basis for the development of drugs that can prevent aggregation at the initial stage.",unfolded state;Alzheimer’s disease;amyloid

The structural and molecular bases of such effects are unknown. Previously, we demonstrated how the folding of intrinsically disordered (ID) protein sequences, in particular, and population shifts, in general, could be used to mediate allosteric coupling between different functional domains, a model that has subsequently been validated in several systems. Here it is shown that population redistribution within allosteric systems can be used as a mechanism to tune protein ensembles such that a given ligand can act as both an agonist and an antagonist. Importantly, this mechanism can be robustly encoded in the ensemble, and does not require that the interactions between the ligand and the protein differ when it is acting either as an agonist or an antagonist. Instead, the effect is due to the relative probabilities of states prior to the addition of the ligand. The ensemble view of allostery that is illuminated by these studies suggests that rather than being seen as switches with fixed responses to allosteric activation, ensembles can evolve to be “functionally pluripotent,” with the capacity to up or down regulate activity in response to a stimulus. This result not only helps to explain the prevalence of intrinsic disorder in transcription factors and other cell signaling proteins, it provides important insights about the energetic ground rules governing site-to-site communication in all allosteric systems.",allostery;conformational fluctuations;ensemble;population shift

Typically, one samples a wide range of structures in an attempt to obtain an ensemble that agrees with some pre-specified set of experimental data. However, models that contain more structures than the available experimental restraints are problematic as the large number of degrees of freedom in the ensemble leads to considerable uncertainty in the final model. We introduce a computationally efficient algorithm called Variational Bayesian Weighting with Structure Selection (VBWSS) for constructing a model for the ensemble of an IDP that contains a minimal number of conformations and, simultaneously, provides estimates for the uncertainty in properties calculated from the model.

Mutations in these proteins have been implicated in many forms of cancer. The intrinsically disordered p53TAD contains two subdomains, TAD1 and TAD2. Using NMR spectroscopy, site-directed mutagenesis, and molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that TAD2 directly interacts with MDM2, adopting transient structures that bind to the same hydrophobic pocket of MDM2 as TAD1. Our data show that binding of TAD1 and TAD2 to MDM2 is competitive, which is further supported by the observation that the interaction of TAD2 with MDM2 can be blocked by the small molecule inhibitor nutlin-3. Our data further indicate that TAD2 interacts with MDMX in a fashion very similar to MDM2. Because TAD2 is known to have transcriptional activity, the interaction of TAD2 with MDM2/MDMX may play a direct role in the inhibition of p53 transactivation.",Biophysics;Intrinsically Disordered Proteins;Molecular Dynamics;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance;p53;MDM2;MDMX

Split inteins are expressed in two separated halves, and the recognition and association of two halves are the first crucial step for initiating trans-splicing. In the present study, we carried out the structural and thermodynamic analysis on the interaction of two halves of DnaE split intein from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Both isolated halves (IN and IC) are disordered and undergo conformational transition from disorder to order upon association. ITC (isothermal titration calorimetry) reveals that the highly favourable enthalpy change drives the association of the two halves, overcoming the unfavourable entropy change. The high flexibility of two fragments and the marked thermodynamic preference provide a robust association for the formation of the well-folded IN/IC complex, which is the basis for reconstituting the trans-splicing activity of DnaE split intein.",disordered protein;intein;NMR spectroscopy;protein folding

We explored the potential utility of this species as a polyhydroxybutyrate production strain, correlating the effects of glucose, nitrogen availability, dissolved oxygen concentration, and extracellular pH with polyhydroxybutyrate production and changes in the Y88 proteomic profile. Using two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry, we identified 217 unique proteins from six growth conditions. We observed reproducible, characteristic proteomic signatures for each of the physiological states we examined. We identified proteins that changed in abundance in correlation with either nitrogen fixation, dissolved oxygen concentration, or acidification of the growth medium. The proteins that correlated with nitrogen fixation were identified either as known nitrogen fixation proteins or as novel proteins that we predict play roles in aspects of nitrogen fixation based on their proteomic profiles. In contrast, the proteins involved in central carbon and polyhydroxybutyrate metabolism were constitutively abundant, consistent with the constitutive polyhydroxybutyrate production that we observed in this species. Three proteins with roles in detoxification of reactive oxygen species were identified in this obligate aerobe. The most abundant protein in all experiments was a polyhydroxyalkanoate granule-associated protein, phasin. The full-length isoform of this protein has a long, intrinsically disordered Ala/Pro/Lys-rich N-terminal segment, a feature that appears to be unique to sphingomonad phasins. The data suggest that Y88 has potential as a PHB production strain due to its aerobic tolerance and metabolic orientation toward polyhydroxybutyrate accumulation, even in low-nitrogen growth medium.",

The actions of these small lipophilic molecules are mediated by intracellular receptor proteins. It is just over 25 yr since the first cDNA for steroid receptors were cloned, a development that led to the birth of a superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors: the nuclear receptors. The receptor proteins share structurally and functionally related ligand binding and DNA-binding domains but possess distinct N-terminal domains and hinge regions that are intrinsically disordered. Since the original cloning experiments, considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the structure, mechanisms of action, and biology of this important class of ligand-activated transcription factors. In recent years, there has been interest in the structural plasticity and function of the N-terminal domain of steroid hormone receptors and in the allosteric regulation of protein folding and function in response to hormone, DNA response element architecture, and coregulatory protein binding partners. The N-terminal domain can exist as an ensemble of conformers, having more or less structure, which prime this region of the receptor to rapidly respond to changes in the intracellular environment through hormone binding and posttranslation modifications. In this review, we address the question of receptor structure and function dynamics with particular emphasis on the structurally flexible N-terminal domain, intra- and interdomain communications, and the allosteric regulation of receptor action.",

The interactions are deeply influenced by host immune molecules and anti-viral compounds, as well as by mutations in viral proteins. To understand how these interactions proceed mechanically and how they are influenced by mutations, one needs to know the structures and dynamics of the proteins. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a powerful computational method for delineating motions of proteins at an atomic-scale via theoretical and empirical principles in physical chemistry. Recent advances in the hardware and software for biomolecular simulation have rapidly improved the precision and performance of this technique. Consequently, MD simulation is quickly extending the range of applications in biology, helping to reveal unique features of protein structures that would be hard to obtain by experimental methods alone.

Domains A and B located in the N-terminal half of the protein are characterized by glutamine-rich (Q-rich) sequences. These Q-rich domains have been shown to be involved in the interaction between Sp1 and different classes of nuclear proteins, such as TATA-binding protein associated factors. Furthermore, the self-association of Sp1 via Q-rich domains is also important for the regulation of transcriptional activity. It has been considered that an Sp1 molecule bound to a “distal” GC-box synergistically interacts with another Sp1 molecule at a “proximal” binding site. Although the formation of multimers via Q-rich domains seems functionally important for Sp1, little is known about the structural and physicochemical nature of the interaction between Q-rich domains. We analyzed the structural details of isolated glutamine-rich B (QB) domains of Sp1 by circular dichroism (CD), analytical ultracentrifugation, and heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). We found the isolated QB domains to be disordered under all conditions examined. Nevertheless, a detailed analysis of NMR spectra clearly indicated interaction between the domains. In particular, the C-terminal half was responsible for the self-association. Furthermore, analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrated weak but significant interaction between isolated QB domains. The self-association between QB domains would be responsible, at least in part, for the formation of multimers by full-length Sp1 molecules that has been proposed to occur during transcriptional activation.",transcription factor;glutamine-rich domain;molecular interaction;intrinsically disordered protein;nuclear magnetic resonance

Small molecules can freely exchange through the NPC, but macromolecules larger than ∼40 kDa must be aided across by transport factors, most of which belong to a related family of proteins termed karyopherins (Kaps). These transport factors bind to the disordered phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat domains in a family of NPC proteins termed FG nups, and this specific binding allows the transport factors to cross the NPC. However, we still know little in terms of the molecular and kinetic details regarding how this binding translates to selective passage of transport factors across the NPC. Here we show that the specific interactions between Kaps and FG nups are strongly modulated by the presence of a cellular milieu whose proteins appear to act as very weak competitors that nevertheless collectively can reduce Kap/FG nup affinities by several orders of magnitude. Without such modulation, the avidities between Kaps and FG nups measured in vitro are too tight to be compatible with the rapid transport kinetics observed in vivo. We modeled the multivalent interactions between the disordered repeat binding sites in the FG nups and multiple cognate binding sites on Kap, showing that they should indeed be sensitive to even weakly binding competitors; the introduction of such competition reduces the availability of these binding sites, dramatically lowering the avidity of their specific interactions and allowing rapid nuclear transport.",

To understand the mechanism of the structural adaptability in the nuclear coactivator binding domain (NCBD), we have compared the dynamics of the hydrophobic core of NCBD in the ligand-free state and in a well-folded complex with the ligand activator for thyroid hormone and retinoid receptors using multiple NMR methods including methyl chemical shifts, coupling constants, and methyl order parameters. From all NMR measures, the aliphatic side chains in the hydrophobic core are slightly more dynamic in the free protein than in the complex, but have mobility comparable to the hydrophobic cores of average folded proteins. Urea titration monitored by NMR reveals that all parts of the protein, including the side-chain packing in the hydrophobic core, denatures in a single cooperative process. The molten globule characteristics of NCBD are thus restricted to a slowly fluctuating tertiary structure. Consequently, the conformational plasticity of the protein is most likely related to its low overall stability rather than an intrinsically flexible protein structure. The well-defined structure supports a model of molecular recognition dominated by conformational selection, whereas only minor structural adjustments are necessary after the association.",

Within the nuclear pore complex, this underlies how transport receptors known as karyopherins proceed through a tethered layer of intrinsically disordered nucleoporin domains containing Phe-Gly (FG)-rich repeats (FG domains) that otherwise hinder passive transport. Here, we use nonspecific proteins (i.e., BSA) as innate molecular probes to explore FG domain conformational changes by surface plasmon resonance. This mathematically diminishes the surface plasmon resonance refractive index constraint, thereby providing the means to acquire and correlate height changes in a surface-tethered FG domain layer to Kap binding affinities in situ with respect to their relative spatial arrangements. Stepwise measurements show that FG domain collapse is caused by karyopherin β1 (Kapβ1) binding at low concentrations, but this gradually transitions into a reextension at higher Kapβ1 concentrations. This ability to self-heal is intimately coupled to Kapβ1-FG binding avidity that promotes the maximal incorporation of Kapβ1 into the FG domain layer. Further increasing Kapβ1 to physiological concentrations leads to a “pileup” of Kapβ1 molecules that bind weakly to unoccupied FG repeats at the top of the layer. Therefore, binding avidity does not hinder fast transport per se. Revealing the biophysical basis underlying the form–function relationship of Kapβ1-FG domain behavior results in a convergent picture in which transport and mechanistic aspects of nuclear pore complex functionality are reconciled.",biointerface;molecular crowding;multivalent binding;nucleocytoplasmic transport;polymer brush

Because IDPs often have the propensity to become locally ordered, we tested whether full-length MeCP2 and its constituent domains would gain secondary structure in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE), a cosolvent that stabilizes intramolecular hydrogen bonding in proteins. The α-helix, β-strand/turn, and unstructured content were determined as a function of TFE concentration by deconvolution of circular dichroism data. Results indicate that approximately two-thirds of the unstructured residues present in full-length MeCP2 were converted to α-helix in 70% TFE without a change in β-strand/turn. Thus, much of the MeCP2 polypeptide chain undergoes coil-to-helix transitions under conditions that favor intrachain hydrogen bond formation. The unstructured residues of the N-terminal (NTD) and C-terminal (CTD) domains were partially converted to α-helix in 70% TFE. In contrast, the central transcription regulation domain (TRD) became almost completely α-helical in 70% TFE. Unlike the NTD, CTD, and TRD, the unstructured content of the methyl DNA binding domain and the intervening domain did not change with increasing TFE concentration. These results indicate that the coil-to-helix transitions that occur in full-length MeCP2 are localized to the NTD, CTD, and TRD, with the TRD showing the greatest tendency for helix formation. The potential relationships between intrinsic disorder, coil-to-helix transitions, and MeCP2 structure and function are discussed.",intrinsically disordered;natively unstructured;disorder-to-order transition;circular dichroism;domain;2;2;2-trifluoroethanol

crowded and selective transport conduit inside the NPC that can only be transited with the
help of nuclear transport receptors (NTRs). It has been shown in vitro that FG Nups
can assemble into two distinct appearances, amyloids and hydrogels. If and how these
phenomena are linked and if they have a physiological role still remains unclear. Using a
variety of high-resolution fluorescence and electron microscopic (EM) tools, we reveal that
crowding conditions mimicking the NPC environment can accelerate the aggregation and amyloid
formation speed of yeast and human FG Nups by orders of magnitude. Aggregation can be
inhibited by NTRs, providing a rationale on how the cell might control amyloid formation of
FG Nups. The superb spatial resolving power of EM also reveals that hydrogels are enlaced
amyloid fibres, and these findings have implications for existing transport models and for
NPC assembly.",intrinsically disordered protein;amyloid fibres;electron microscopy;fluorescence spectroscopy;nuclear pore complex

BER/SSBR in mammalian cells is complex, with preferred and backup sub-pathways, and is linked to genome replication and transcription. The early BER/SSBR enzymes, namely, DNA glycosylases (DGs) and the end-processing proteins such as abasic endonuclease 1 (APE1), form complexes with downstream repair (and other noncanonical) proteins via pairwise interactions. Furthermore, a unique feature of mammalian early BER/ SSBR enzymes is the presence of a disordered terminal extension that is absent in their Escherichia coli prototypes. These nonconserved segments usually contain organelle-targeting signals, common interaction interfaces, and sites of posttranslational modifications that may be involved in regulating their repair function including lesion scanning. Finally, the linkage of BER/SSBR deficiency to cancer, aging, and human neurodegenerative diseases, and therapeutic targeting of BER/SSBR are discussed.",

The Aβ monomers and oligomers are the building blocks of the aggregates. In this work, we report the structures and free energy landscapes of the monomeric zinc(II)-bound Aβ40 (Zn:Aβ40) and zinc(II)-bound Aβ42 (Zn:Aβ42) intrinsically disordered fibrillogenic metallopeptides in an aqueous solution by utilizing an approach that employs first principles calculations and parallel tempering molecular dynamics simulations. The structural and thermodynamic properties, including the secondary and tertiary structures and conformational Gibbs free energies of these intrinsically disordered metallopeptide alloforms, are presented. The results show distinct differing characteristics for these metallopeptides. For example, prominent β-sheet formation in the N-terminal region (Asp1, Arg5, and Tyr10) of Zn:Aβ40 is significantly decreased or lacking in Zn:Aβ42. Our findings indicate that blocking multiple reactive residues forming abundant β-sheet structure located in the central hydrophobic core and C-terminal regions of Zn:Aβ42 via antibodies or small organic molecules might help to reduce the aggregation of Zn(II)-bound Aβ42. Furthermore, we find that helix formation increases but β-sheet formation decreases in the C-terminal region upon Zn(II) binding to Aβ. This depressed β-sheet formation in the C-terminal region (Gly33–Gly38) in monomeric Zn:Aβ42 might be linked to the formation of amorphous instead of fibrillar aggregates of Zn:Aβ42.",Intrinsically disordered metalloprotein;Molecular dynamics simulations;Amyloid-β;Zinc

Among alternatively spliced exons, tissue-specific exons play a critical role in maintaining tissue identity. This raises the question of how tissue-specific protein-coding exons influence protein function. Here we investigate the structural, functional, interaction, and evolutionary properties of constitutive, tissue-specific, and other alternative exons in human. We find that tissue-specific protein segments often contain disordered regions, are enriched in posttranslational modification sites, and frequently embed conserved binding motifs. Furthermore, genes containing tissue-specific exons tend to occupy central positions in interaction networks and display distinct interaction partners in the respective tissues, and are enriched in signaling, development, and disease genes. Based on these findings, we propose that tissue-specific inclusion of disordered segments that contain binding motifs rewires interaction networks and signaling pathways. In this way, tissue-specific splicing may contribute to functional versatility of proteins and increases the diversity of interaction networks across tissues.",

How do cellular systems balance the detrimental and beneficial effect of protein aggregation? We reveal that aggregation-prone proteins are subject to differential transcriptional, translational, and degradation control compared to nonaggregation-prone proteins, which leads to their decreased synthesis, low abundance, and high turnover. Genetic modulators that enhance the aggregation phenotype are enriched in genes that influence expression homeostasis. Moreover, genes encoding aggregation-prone proteins are more likely to be harmful when overexpressed. The trends are evolutionarily conserved and suggest a strategy whereby cellular mechanisms specifically modulate the availability of aggregation-prone proteins to (1) keep concentrations below the critical ones required for aggregation and (2) shift the equilibrium between the monomeric and oligomeric/aggregate form, as explained by Le Chatelier’s principle. This strategy may prevent formation of undesirable aggregates and keep functional assemblies/aggregates under control.",

A recently revised version of the additive CHARMM protein force field, which includes optimization of the backbone CMAP potential to achieve good balance between different types of secondary structure, correcting the α-helical bias present in the former CHARMM22/CMAP energy function, is shown to result in improved cooperativity for the helix-coil transition. This is due to retention of the empirical corrections introduced in the original CMAP to reproduce folded protein structures—corrections that capture many-body effects missing from an energy surface fitted to gas phase calculations on dipeptides. The experimental temperature dependence of helix formation in (AAQAA)3 and parameters for helix nucleation and elongation are in much better agreement with experiment than those obtained with other recent force fields. In contrast, CMAP parameters derived by fitting to a vacuum quantum mechanical surface for the alanine dipeptide do not reproduce the enhanced cooperativity, showing that the empirical backbone corrections, and not some other feature of the force field, are responsible. We also find that the cooperativity of β-hairpin formation is much improved relative to other force fields we have studied. Comparison with (ϕ,ψ) distributions from the Protein Data Bank further justifies the inclusion of many-body effects in the CMAP. These results suggest that the revised energy function will be suitable for both simulations of unfolded or intrinsically disordered proteins and for investigating protein-folding mechanisms.",

As the common thread in the expanded polyglutamine repeat diseases, it is important to understand the structure and properties of simple polyglutamine sequences. At the same time, experience has shown that sequences attached to polyglutamine, whether in artificial constructs or in disease proteins, can influence structure and properties. The two major contenders for the molecular source of the neurotoxicity implicit in polyglutamine expansion within disease proteins are a populated toxic conformation in the monomer ensemble and a toxic aggregated species.

Now, the availability of large interactomes for several model organisms permits exploration of the role of disorder in protein interaction networks not only at the level of the interacting proteins but of the interactions themselves. By comparing the interactomes of human, fly, and yeast, we discovered that, despite being much more abundant, disordered interactions are significantly less conserved than their ordered counterparts. Furthermore, our analyses provide evidence that this happens not only because disordered proteins are less conserved but also because they display a higher capacity to rewire their interaction neighborhood through evolution. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that conservation of disorder gives a clear evolutionary advantage, facilitating the change of interaction partners during evolution. Moreover, this mechanism is not exclusive of a few anecdotal cases but a global feature present in the interactome networks of entire organisms.",

By combining a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments, we reveal that TP recognition is determined by sequence-independent interactions and vectorial-specific recognition domains. Using both native and reversed TPs for two well-studied precursors, small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bis-phosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, and ferredoxin, we exposed these two modes of recognition. Toc34 receptor (34-kD subunit of the translocon of the outer envelope) recognition in vitro, preprotein binding in organellar, precursor binding in vivo, and the recognition of TPs by the major stromal molecular motor Hsp70 are specific for the physicochemical properties of the TP. However, translocation in organellar and in vivo demonstrates strong specificity to recognition domain organization. This organization specificity correlates with the N-terminal placement of a strong Hsp70 recognition element. These results are discussed in light of how individual translocon components sequentially interact with the precursor during binding and translocation and helps explain the apparent lack of sequence conservation in chloroplast TPs.",

The biochemical significance of proteins that lack stable tertiary structure, however, is not clearly understood, largely owing to an inability to assign well-defined structures to specific biological tasks. In an attempt to investigate the structural character of ID protein, we have measured the circular dichroism spectrum of the N-terminal region of p53 over a range of temperatures and solution conditions. p53 is a well-studied transcription factor that has a proline-rich N-terminal ID region containing two activation domains. High proline content is a property commonly associated with ID, and thus p53 may be a good model system for investigating the biochemical importance of ID. The spectra presented here suggest that the N-terminal region of p53 may adopt an ordered structure under physiological conditions and that this structure can be thermally unfolded in an apparent two-state manner. The midpoint temperature for this thermal unfolding of the N-terminal region of p53 was at the near-physiological temperature of 39°C, suggesting the possibility of a physiological role for the observed structural equilibrium.",p53;intrinsically disordered protein;ID;thermal unfolding

For proteins such as tau in Alzheimer’s disease and α-synuclein in Parkinson’s disease, aggregation involves a transition from an intrinsically disordered monomer to a highly structured fiber. While understanding the role of these proteins in neurodegeneration requires elucidation of the structural basis of self-association, the conformational heterogeneity of disordered proteins makes their structural characterization inherently challenging. Here we use single molecule Förster resonance energy transfer to measure the conformational ensemble of tau in the absence and presence of heparin to identify critical conformational changes relevant to the initiation of aggregation. We find that different domains of tau display distinct conformational properties that are strongly correlated with their degree of disorder and which may relate to their roles in aggregation. Moreover, we observe that heparin binding induces a distinct two-state structural transition in tau described by a loss of long-range contacts and a concomitant compaction of the microtubule binding domain. Our results describe a conformational intermediate of tau that precedes the formation of aggregates and could serve as a target for tau-focused therapeutics.",microtubule binding protein;tauopathies;neurofibrillary tangles

Osteopontin has diverse effects on hydroxyapatite (HA) mineral crystallite formation and growth depending on the extent of phosphorylation. We hypothesized that different regions of full-length OPN would also have distinct effects on the mineralization process. Thrombin fragmentation of milk OPN (mOPN) was used to test this hypothesis. Three fragments were tested in a de novo HA formation assay; an N-terminal fragment (aa 1–147), a central fragment (aa 148–204) denoted SKK-fragment and a C-terminal fragment (aa 205–262). Compared to intact mOPN the C- and N-terminal fragments behaved comparably, promoting HA formation and growth, but the central SKK-fragment acted as a mineralization inhibitor. In a seeded growth experiment all fragments inhibited mineral proliferation, but the SKK-fragment was the most effective inhibitor. These effects, seen in HA-formation and seeded growth assays in a gelatin gel system and in a pH-stat experiment were lost when the protein or fragments were dephosphorylated. Effects of the fully phosphorylated protein and fragments were also altered in the presence of fibrillar collagen. The diverse effects can be explained in terms of the intrinsically disordered nature of OPN and its fragments which enable them to interact with their multiple partners.",Osteopontin;hydroxyapatite;SIBLING proteins;mineralization mechanisms

In this work, we report that recombinant 100% N-terminal acetylated α-synuclein purified under mild physiological conditions presents as a primarily monomeric protein, and that the N-terminal acetyl group affects the transient secondary structure and fibril assembly rates of the protein. Residue-specific NMR chemical shift analysis indicates substantial increase in transient helical propensity in the first 9 N-terminal residues, as well as smaller long-range changes in residues 28–31, 43–46, and 50–66: regions in which the three familial mutations currently known to be causative of early onset disease are found. In addition, we show that the N-terminal acetylated protein forms fibrils that are morphologically similar to those formed from nonacetylated α-synuclein, but that their growth rates are slower. Our results highlight that N-terminal acetylation does not form significant numbers of dimers, tetramers, or higher molecular weight species, but does alter the conformational distributions of monomeric α-synuclein species in regions known to be important in metal binding, in association with membranes, and in regions known to affect fibril formation rates.",α-synuclein;N-terminal acetylated α-synuclein;NMR;mass spectrometry;aggregation;Parkinson's disease;fluorescence;amyloid fibril

NCBD:TCA intermolecular recognition has challenged traditional investigation as both NCBD and several of its corresponding TCAs are intrinsically disordered. Using 40µs of explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations, we relate the conformational diversity of ligand-free NCBD to its bound configurations. We introduce two novel techniques to quantify the conformational heterogeneity of ligand-free NCBD, dihedral quasi-anharmonic analysis (dQAA) and hierarchical graph-based diffusive clustering. With this integrated approach we find that three of four ligand-bound states are natively accessible to the ligand-free NCBD simulations with root-mean squared deviation (RMSD) less than 2Å. These conformations are accessible via diverse pathways while a rate-limiting barrier must be crossed in order to access the fourth bound state.",intrinsically disordered proteins;NCBD;quasi-anharmonic analysis;graph-theoretic spectral clustering

Moreover, activated β-catenin can be oncogenic and, notably, drives colorectal cancer. Inhibiting oncogenic β-catenin has proven a formidable challenge. Here we design a screen for small-molecule inhibitors of β-catenin's binding to its cofactor BCL9, and discover five related natural compounds, including carnosic acid from rosemary, which attenuates transcriptional β-catenin outputs in colorectal cancer cells. Evidence from NMR and analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrates that the carnosic acid response requires an intrinsically labile α-helix (H1) amino-terminally abutting the BCL9-binding site in β-catenin. Similarly, in colorectal cancer cells with hyperactive β-catenin signalling, carnosic acid targets predominantly the transcriptionally active ('oncogenic') form of β-catenin for proteasomal degradation in an H1-dependent manner. Hence, H1 is an 'Achilles' Heel' of β-catenin, which can be exploited for destabilization of oncogenic β-catenin by small molecules, providing proof-of-principle for a new strategy for developing direct inhibitors of oncogenic β-catenin.",

This domain is controlled by phosphorylation, but how phosphorylation impacts AF1 structure and function is unclear. We found that serine 118 (S118) phosphorylation of the ERα AF1 region in response to estrogen (agonist), tamoxifen (antagonist), and growth factors results in recruitment of the peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase Pin1. Phosphorylation of S118 is critical for Pin1 binding, and mutation of S118 to alanine prevents this association. Importantly, Pin1 isomerizes the serine118-proline119 bond from a cis to trans isomer, with a concomitant increase in AF1 transcriptional activity. Pin1 overexpression promotes ligand-independent and tamoxifen-inducible activity of ERα and growth of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells. Pin1 expression correlates with proliferation in ERα-positive rat mammary tumors. These results establish phosphorylation-coupled proline isomerization as a mechanism modulating AF1 functional activity and provide insight into the role of a conformational switch in the functional regulation of the intrinsically disordered transactivation domain of ERα.",

In this study, we surprisingly found that a slow, spontaneous α-to-coil-to-β transition could be monitored by circular dichroism spectroscopy in one full-length mouse recombinant prion mutant protein, denoted S132C/N181C, in which the endogenous cysteines C179 and C214 were replaced by Ala and S132 and N181 were replaced by Cys, during incubation in a non-denaturing neutral buffer. No denaturant was required to destabilize the native state for the conversion. The product after this structural conversion is toxic β-oligomers with high fluorescence intensity when binding with thioflavin T. Site-directed spin-labeling ESR data suggested that the structural conversion involves the unfolding of helix 2. After examining more protein mutants, it was found that the spontaneous structural conversion is due to the disulfide-deletion (C to A mutations). The recombinant wild-type mouse prion protein could also be transformed into β-oligomers and amyloid fibrils simply by dissolving and incubating the protein in 0.5 mM NaOAc (pH 7) and 1 mM DTT at 25°C with no need of adding any denaturant to destabilize the prion protein.

The mechanisms of Cx32 intracellular channel regulation have not been clearly defined. However, Ca2+, pH, and the phosphorylation state can regulate Cx32 gap junction channels, in addition to the direct interaction of protein partners with the carboxyl-terminal (CT) domain. In this study, we used different biophysical methods to determine the structure and characterize the interaction of the Cx32CT domain with the protein partners synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97) and calmodulin (CaM). Our results revealed that the Cx32CT is an intrinsically disordered protein that becomes α-helical upon binding CaM. We identified the GUK domain as the minimal SAP97 region necessary for the Cx32CT interaction. The Cx32CT residues affected by the binding of CaM and the SAP97 GUK domain were determined as well as the dissociation constants for these interactions. We characterized three Cx32CT Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease mutants (R219H, R230C, and F235C) and identified that whereas they all formed functional channels, they all showed reduced binding affinity for SAP97 and CaM. Additionally, we report that in RT4-D6P2T rat schwannoma cells, Cx32 is differentially phosphorylated and exists in a complex with SAP97 and CaM.

In addition to its role in the molecular pathology of the polyglutamine expansion diseases, mutations of the protein are associated with X-linked mental retardation. PQBP-1 binds specifically to glutamine repeat sequences and proline-rich regions, and interacts with RNA polymerase II and the spliceosomal protein U5-15kD. In this work, we obtained a biophysical characterization of this protein by employing complementary structural methods. PQBP-1 is shown to be a moderately compact but largely disordered molecule with an elongated shape, having a Stokes radius of 3.7 nm and a maximum molecular dimension of 13 nm. The protein is monomeric in solution, has residual β-structure, and is in a premolten globule state that is unaffected by natural osmolytes. Using small-angle x-ray scattering data, we were able to generate a low-resolution, three-dimensional model of PQBP-1.",

Solution X-ray scattering studies, in combination with macromolecular X-ray crystallography (MX) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), strive to determine complete and accurate states of macromolecules, providing novel insights describing allosteric mechanisms, supramolecular complexes, and dynamic molecular machines. This review addresses theoretical and practical concepts, concerns, and considerations for using these techniques in conjunction with computational methods to productively combine solution-scattering data with high-resolution structures. I discuss the principal means of direct identification of macromolecular flexibility from SAXS data followed by critical concerns about the methods used to calculate theoretical SAXS profiles from high-resolution structures. The SAXS profile is a direct interrogation of the thermodynamic ensemble and techniques such as, for example, minimal ensemble search (MES), enhance interpretation of SAXS experiments by describing the SAXS profiles as population-weighted thermodynamic ensembles. I discuss recent developments in computational techniques used for conformational sampling, and how these techniques provide a basis for assessing the level of the flexibility within a sample. Although these approaches sacrifice atomic detail, the knowledge gained from ensemble analysis is often appropriate for developing hypotheses and guiding biochemical experiments. Examples of the use of SAXS and combined approaches with X-ray crystallography, NMR, and computational methods to characterize dynamic assemblies are presented.",Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS);Macromolecular flexibility;Rigid-body modeling;Ensemble analysis

In honeybee (Apis mellifera), the protein (AmVg) also affects social behavior and life-span plasticity. Despite its manifold functions, the AmVg molecule remains poorly understood. The subject of our structure-oriented AmVg study is its polyserine tract — a little-investigated repetitive protein segment mostly found in insects. We previously reported that AmVg is tissue specifically cleaved in the vicinity of this tract. Here, we show that, despite its potential for an open, disordered structure, AmVg is unexpectedly resistant to trypsin/chymotrypsin digestion at the tract. Our findings suggest that multiple phosphorylation plays a role in this resilience. Sequence variation is highly pronounced at the polyserine region in insect Vgs. We demonstrate that sequence differences in this region can lead to structural variation, as NMR and circular dichroism (CD) evidence assign different conformational propensities to polyserine peptides from the honeybee and the jewel wasp Nasonia vitripennis; the former is extended and disordered and the latter more compact and helical. CD analysis of the polyserine region of bumblebee Bombus ignitus and wasp Pimpla nipponica supports a random coil structure in these species. The spectroscopic results strengthen our model of the AmVg polyserine tract as a flexible domain linker shielded by phosphorylation.",polyserine linker;phosphorylation;vitellogenin;honeybee;NMR

It is not clear how a RING E3 ligase differentiates a naked E2 enzyme from the E2∼ubiquitin-conjugated form or how this is altered upon ubiquitin transfer. RING-box protein 1 (Rbx1/ROC1) is a key protein found in the Skp1/Cullin-1/F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that functions with the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme CDC34. The solution structure of Rbx1/ROC1 revealed a globular RING domain (residues 40–108) stabilized by three structural zinc ions (root mean square deviation 0.30 ± 0.04 Å) along with a disordered N terminus (residues 12–39). Titration data showed that Rbx1/ROC1 preferentially recruits CDC34 in its ubiquitin-conjugated form and favors this interaction by 50-fold compared with unconjugated CDC34. Furthermore, NMR and biochemical assays identified residues in helix α2 of Rbx1/ROC1 that are essential for binding and activating CDC34∼ubiquitin for ubiquitylation. Taken together, this work provides the first direct structural and biochemical evidence showing that polyubiquitylation by the RING E3 ligase Rbx1/ROC1 requires the preferential recruitment of an E2∼ubiquitin complex and subsequent release of the unconjugated E2 protein upon ubiquitin transfer to a substrate or ubiquitin chain.",E3 Ubiquitin Ligase;Enzyme Mechanisms;Protein Complexes;Structural Biology;Ubiquitin Conjugating Enzyme (Ubc);Ubiquitination

However, many aspects of CoV behavior, including modes of its transmission, are yet to be fully understood. We show that the amount and the peculiarities of distribution of the protein intrinsic disorder in the viral shell can be used for the efficient analysis of the behavior and transmission modes of CoV. The proposed model allows categorization of the various CoVs by the peculiarities of disorder distribution in their membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). This categorization enables quick identification of viruses with similar behaviors in transmission, regardless of genetic proximity. Based on this analysis, an empirical model for predicting the viral transmission behavior is developed. This model is able to explain some behavioral aspects of important coronaviruses that previously were not fully understood. The new predictor can be a useful tool for better epidemiological, clinical, and structural understanding of behavior of both newly emerging viruses and viruses that have been known for a long time. A potentially new vaccine strategy could involve searches for viral strains that are characterized by the evolutionary misfit between the peculiarities of the disorder distribution in their shells and their behavior.",

Rapid kinetics measurements with cytochrome c using submillisecond continuous flow mixing devices suggest simultaneous formation of a compact collapsed state and secondary structure. These data seem to indicate that collapse formation is guided by specific short and long range interactions (heteropolymer collapse). A contrasting interpretation also has been proposed, which suggests that the collapse formation is rapid, nonspecific, and a trivial solvent related compaction, which could as well be observed by a homopolymer (homopolymer collapse). We address this controversy using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), which enables us to monitor the salt-induced compaction accompanying collapse formation and the associated time constant directly at single molecule resolution. In addition, we follow the formation of secondary structure using far UV CD. The data presented here suggest that both these models (homopolymer and heteropolymer) could be applicable depending on the solution conditions. For example, the formation of secondary structure and compact state is not simultaneous in aqueous buffer. In aqueous buffer, formation of the compact state occurs through a two-state co-operative transition following heteropolymer formalism, whereas secondary structure formation takes place gradually. In contrast, in the presence of urea, a compaction of the protein radius occurs gradually over an extended range of salt concentration following homopolymer formalism.

These genes have been proposed to play roles in axon targeting, synaptic development and neuronal survival, although their specific cellular roles remain poorly defined. In zebrafish there are four clustered protocadherin genes, 2 pcdh clusters and 2 pcdh clusters, that give rise to over 100 distinct proteins, each with a distinct ectodomain. The zebrafish is an excellent model in which to address the function of protocadherins during neural development, as the embryos are transparent, develop rapidly, and are amenable to experimental manipulation. As a first step to investigating the clustered protocadherins during zebrafish development, we have generated antibodies against the common cytodomains of zebrafish Pcdh. We compare the distribution of Pcdh with Pcdh and find a similar pan-neuronal pattern, with strong labeling of neurons within all major regions of the central nervous system. Pcdh and Pcdh are particularly enriched in the developing visual system, with strong labeling found in the synaptic layers of the retina, as well as the optic tectum. Consistent with studies in mouse, we find that Pcdh and Pcdh are present in a complex, as they can be co-immunoprecipitated from zebrafish larval extracts. This interaction is direct and occurs through the ectodomains of these proteins. Using standard bead aggregation assays, we find no evidence for intrinsic adhesive ability by either Pcdh or Pcdh, suggesting that they do not function as cell adhesion molecules.",protocadherin;zebrafish;central nervous system;synapse

Deregulation of Myc via gene amplification, chromosomal translocation or other mechanisms lead to tumorigenesis including Burkitt lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and many other malignancies. The oncogene myc is a highly potent transforming gene and capable to transform various cell types in vivo and in vitro. Its oncogenic activity initialized by deregulated expression leads to a shift of the equilibrium in the Myc/Max/Mad network towards Myc/Max complexes. The Myc/Max heterodimerization is a prerequisite for transcriptional functionality of Myc. Primarily, we are focusing on the apo-state of the C-terminal domain of v-Myc, the retroviral homolog of human c-Myc. Based on multi-dimensional NMR measurements v-Myc appears to be neither a fully structured nor a completely unstructured protein. The bHLHZip domain of v-Myc does not exist as a random coil but exhibits partially pre-formed α-helical regions in its apo-state.

The first step calculates a feature set that represents each residue in the input sequence using a sliding window, i.e. the calculation of the features is based on a segment of residues centered over the input (to-be-predicted) residue. The use of the window is a popular approach in the design of similar sequence-based predictors (Kurgan and Disfani, 2011). In the second step, a vector of 24 features is fed into a linear SVM to calculate propensity of a given input residue to form a MoRF region. The choice of SVM is motivated by its applications in prediction of disordered regions (Ishida and Kinoshita, 2008; Mizianty et al. 2010) and B-factors (Chen et al., 2007). Due to a large number of amino acids that need to be predicted, we use a fast liblinear SVM (Fan et al. 2008) that was previously utilized in MFDp (Mizianty et al. 2010), which is one of the top disorder predictors (Peng and Kurgan, 2011). The output of our method is a real value that quantifies probability of a given residue to form a MoRF region. These values are binarized using a cutoff of 0.5; i.e. amino acids with P > 0.5 are assumed to form MoRFs. Finally, in the third step, these propensities are merged with results of alignment of the input protein against the MoRF-annotated proteins in the training dataset to produce the final propensities.",

Different methods often have to be trained to predict them separately. In this study, we developed a single neural-network-based technique called SPINE-D that makes a three-state prediction first (ordered residues and disordered residues in short and long disordered regions) and reduces it into a two-state prediction afterwards. SPINE-D was tested on various sets composed of different combinations of Disprot annotated proteins and proteins directly from the PDB annotated for disorder by missing coordinates in X-ray determined structures. While disorder annotations are different according to Disprot and X-ray approaches, SPINE-D's prediction accuracy and ability to predict disorder are relatively independent of how the method was trained and what type of annotation was employed but strongly depend on the balance in the relative populations of ordered and disordered residues in short and long disordered regions in the test set. With greater than 85% overall specificity for detecting residues in both short and long disordered regions, the residues in long disordered regions are easier to predict at 81% sensitivity in a balanced test dataset with 56.5% ordered residues but more challenging (at 65% sensitivity) in a test dataset with 90% ordered residues. Compared to eleven other methods, SPINE-D yields the highest area under the curve (AUC), the highest Mathews correlation coefficient for residue-based prediction, and the lowest mean square error in predicting disorder contents of proteins for an independent test set with 329 proteins. In particular, SPINE-D is comparable to a meta predictor in predicting disordered residues in long disordered regions and superior in short disordered regions. SPINE-D participated in CASP 9 blind prediction and is one of the top servers according to the official ranking. In addition, SPINE-D was examined for prediction of functional molecular recognition motifs in several case studies. The server and databases are available at http://sparks.informatics.iupui.edu/.",

This shapes the output of signal responses as well as providing specificity and localization. The Membrane Associated Guanylate Kinases (MAGuKs) are scaffold proteins at cellular junctions that localize cell surface receptors and link them to downstream signaling enzymes. Scaffold proteins often contain protein-binding domains that are connected in series by disordered linkers. The tertiary structure of the folded domains is well understood, but describing the dynamic inter-domain interactions (the superteritary structure) of such multidomain proteins remains a challenge to structural biology. We used 65 distance restraints from single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to describe the superteritary structure of the canonical MAGuK scaffold protein PSD-95. By combining multiple fluorescence techniques, the conformational dynamics of PSD-95 could be characterized across the biologically relevant timescales for protein domain motions. Relying only on a qualitative interpretation of FRET data, we were able to distinguish stable interdomain interactions from freely orienting domains. This revealed that the five domains in PSD-95 partitioned into two independent supramodules: PDZ1-PDZ2 and PDZ3-SH3-GuK. We used our smFRET data for hybrid structural refinement to model the PDZ3-SH3-GuK supramodule and include explicit dye simulations to provide complete characterization of potential uncertainties inherent to quantitative interpretation of FRET as distance. Comparative structural analysis of synaptic MAGuK homologues showed a conservation of this supertertiary structure. Our approach represents a general solution to describing the supertertiary structure of multidomain proteins.",intrinsic disorder;protein structure;single molecule fluorescence;fluorescence lifetime;fluorescence correlation spectroscopy

There has been an explosion in CTA-based research since CTAs were first identified in 1991 and MAGE-1 was shown to elicit an autologous cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response in a patient with melanoma. The resulting data have not only highlighted a role for CTAs in tumorigenesis, but have also underscored the translational potential of these antigens for detecting and treating many types of cancers. Studies that have investigated the use of CTAs for the clinical management of urological malignancies indicate that these TAAs have potential roles as novel biomarkers, with increased specificity and sensitivity compared to those currently used in the clinic, and therapeutic targets for cancer immunotherapy. Increasing evidence supports the utilization of these promising tools for urological indications.",

Frizzell (ude.ttip@llezzirf).","Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA)–regulated chloride channel whose phosphorylation controls anion secretion across epithelial cell apical membranes. We examined the hypothesis that cAMP/PKA stimulation regulates CFTR biogenesis posttranslationally, based on predicted 14-3-3 binding motifs within CFTR and forskolin-induced CFTR expression. The 14-3-3β, γ, and ε isoforms were expressed in airway cells and interacted with CFTR in coimmunoprecipitation assays. Forskolin stimulation (15 min) increased 14-3-3β and ε binding to immature and mature CFTR (bands B and C), and 14-3-3 overexpression increased CFTR bands B and C and cell surface band C. In pulse-chase experiments, 14-3-3β increased the synthesis of immature CFTR, reduced its degradation rate, and increased conversion of immature to mature CFTR. Conversely, 14-3-3β knockdown decreased CFTR B and C bands (70 and 55%) and elicited parallel reductions in cell surface CFTR and forskolin-stimulated anion efflux. In vitro, 14-3-3β interacted with the CFTR regulatory region, and by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, this interaction occurred at known PKA phosphorylated sites. In coimmunoprecipitation assays, forskolin stimulated the CFTR/14-3-3β interaction while reducing CFTR's interaction with coat protein complex 1 (COP1). Thus 14-3-3 binding to phosphorylated CFTR augments its biogenesis by reducing retrograde retrieval of CFTR to the endoplasmic reticulum. This mechanism permits cAMP/PKA stimulation to make more CFTR available for anion secretion.",

Newly available genomic sequence data for the phylum Cyanobacteria reveals a heretofore unobserved diversity in cyanobacterial CP12 proteins. Cyanobacterial CP12 proteins can be classified into eight different types based on primary structure features. Among these are CP12-CBS (for cystathionine-β-synthase) domain fusions. CBS domains are regulatory modules for a wide range of cellular activities; many of these bind adenine nucleotides through a conserved motif that is also present in the CBS domains fused to CP12. In addition, a survey of expression data sets shows that the CP12 paralogs are differentially regulated. Furthermore, modeling of the cyanobacterial CP12 protein variants based on the recently available three-dimensional structure of the canonical cyanobacterial CP12 in complex with GAPDH suggests that some of the newly identified cyanobacterial CP12 types are unlikely to bind to GAPDH. Collectively these data show that, as is becoming increasingly apparent for plant CP12 proteins, the role of CP12 in cyanobacteria is likely more complex than previously appreciated, possibly involving other signals in addition to light. Moreover, our findings substantiate the proposal that this small protein may have multiple roles in photosynthetic organisms.",

In spite of individual successes in understanding the structural determinants of allostery in well-documented systems, much less success has been achieved in identifying a set of quantitative and transferable ground rules that provide an understanding of how allostery works. Are there organizing principles that allow us to relate structurally different proteins, or are the determinants of allostery unique to each system? Using an ensemble-based model, we show that allosteric phenomena can be formulated in terms of conformational free energies of the cooperative elements in a protein and the coupling interactions between them. Interestingly, the resulting allosteric ground rules provide a framework to reconcile observations that challenge purely structural models of site-to-site coupling, including (a) allostery in the absence of pathways of structural distortions, (b) allostery in the absence of any structural change, and (c) the ability of allosteric ligands to act as agonists under some circumstances and antagonists under others. The ensemble view of allostery that emerges provides insights into the energetic prerequisites of site-to-site coupling and thus into how allostery works.",protein thermodynamics;conformational change;protein function;signal transduction;agonism;antagonism

We show here that the acidic sequence of PEP-19 has intrinsic Ca2+ binding activity, which may modulate Ca2+ binding to CaM by stabilizing an initial Ca2+-CaM complex or by electrostatically steering Ca2+ to and from CaM. Because PEP-19 is expressed in cells that exhibit highly active Ca2+ dynamics, we tested the hypothesis that it influences ligand-dependent Ca2+ release. We show that PEP-19 increases the sensitivity of HeLa cells to ATP-induced Ca2+ release to greatly increase the percentage of cells responding to sub-saturating doses of ATP and increases the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations. Mutations in the acidic sequence of PEP-19 that inhibit or prevent it from modulating Ca2+ binding to CaM greatly inhibit its effect on ATP-induced Ca2+ release. Thus, this cellular effect of PEP-19 does not depend simply on binding to CaM via the IQ motif but requires its acidic metal binding domain. Tuning the activities of Ca2+ mobilization pathways places PEP-19 at the top of CaM signaling cascades, with great potential to exert broad effects on downstream CaM targets, thus expanding the biological significance of this small regulator of CaM signaling.",Calcium Signaling;Calmodulin;Intrinsically Disordered Proteins;NMR;Purinergic Receptor;IQ Motif;PEP-19;Ligand-induced Calcium Release

The role these intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) play in protein function is an area of significant interest. In particular, because proteins containing IDRs are largely involved in processes related to molecular recognition, the question arises whether IDRs are important in these recognition events. It has been observed that IDRs are enriched in transcription factors (TFs) in comparison with other proteins, and we sought to explore this enrichment more precisely, with an eye toward functional dissection of the prevalence and locations of IDRs in different classes of TFs. Specifically, we considered the occurrences of 76 classes of DNA-binding domains (DBDs) within a comprehensive set of 1,747 human, sequence-specific TFs. For each DBD class, we analyzed whether a significant level of disorder was present within the DBD itself, the N-terminal or C-terminal sequence flanking the DBD, or both flanking sequences. We found that although the DBDs themselves exhibit significant order, the regions flanking the DBDs exhibit significant disorder, which suggests a functional role for such IDRs in TF DNA binding. These results may have important implications for studies of TFs not just in human but across all eukaryotes, and suggest future studies focused on testing the roles of N- and C-terminal flanking regions in determining or modulating the DNA binding a affinity and/or specificity of the associated TFs.",intrinsically disordered region;DNA-binding domain;transcription factor

While the connection between α-synuclein and Parkinson's disease is well established, recent evidence links point mutants of βS to dementia with Lewy bodies. Overexpression of γS has been associated with enhanced metastasis and cancer drug resistance. Despite their prevalence in such a variety of diseases, the native functions of the synucleins remain unclear. They have a lipid-binding motif in their N-terminal region, which suggests interactions with biological membranes in vivo. In this study, we used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to monitor the binding properties of βS and γS to model membranes and to determine the free energy of the interactions. Our results show that the interactions are most strongly affected by the presence of both anionic lipids and bilayer curvature, while membrane fluidity plays a very minor role. Quantifying the lipid-binding properties of βS and γS provides additional insights into the underlying factors governing the protein–membrane interactions. Such insights not only are relevant to the native functions of these proteins but also highlight their contributions to pathological conditions that are either mediated or characterized by perturbations of these interactions.",intrinsically disordered proteins;amphipathic;dementia with Lewy bodies;Parkinson's disease;aggregation

Such linkage effects on the aggregation of endogenous polypeptides have been largely neglected, although all these macromolecules have been known to effectively and robustly solubilize their linked heterologous proteins in fusion or display technology. Thus, their roles in the aggregation of linked endogenous polypeptides need to be elucidated and incorporated into the mechanisms of de novo protein folding in vivo. In the classic hydrophobic interaction-based stabilizing mechanism underlying the molecular chaperone-assisted protein folding, it has been assumed that the macromolecules connected through a simple linkage without hydrophobic interactions and conformational changes would make no effect on the aggregation of their linked polypeptide chains. However, an increasing line of evidence indicates that the intrinsic properties of soluble macromolecules, especially their surface charges and excluded volume, could be important and universal factors for stabilizing their linked polypeptides against aggregation. Taken together, these macromolecules could act as folding helpers by keeping their linked nascent chains in a folding-competent state. The folding assistance provided by these macromolecules in the linkage context would give new insights into de novo protein folding inside the cell.",folding;macromolecules;aggregation;hydrophobic interaction;molecular chaperone;surface charges;excluded volume

Two recent studies suggested that α-syn produced in Escherichia coli or isolated from mammalian cells and red blood cells exists predominantly as a tetramer that is rich in α-helical structure (Bartels, T., Choi, J. G., and Selkoe, D. J. (2011) Nature 477, 107–110; Wang, W., Perovic, I., Chittuluru, J., Kaganovich, A., Nguyen, L. T. T., Liao, J., Auclair, J. R., Johnson, D., Landeru, A., Simorellis, A.

However, it remains unknown whether or not this putative tetramer is the main physiological form of α-syn in the brain. In this study, we investigated the oligomeric state of α-syn in mouse, rat, and human brains. To assess the conformational and oligomeric state of native α-syn in complex mixtures, we generated α-syn standards of known quaternary structure and conformational properties and compared the behavior of endogenously expressed α-syn to these standards using native and denaturing gel electrophoresis techniques, size-exclusion chromatography, and an oligomer-specific ELISA. Our findings demonstrate that both human and rodent α-syn expressed in the central nervous system exist predominantly as an unfolded monomer. Similar results were observed when human α-syn was expressed in mouse and rat brains as well as mammalian cell lines (HEK293, HeLa, and SH-SY5Y). Furthermore, we show that α-syn expressed in E. coli and purified under denaturing or nondenaturing conditions, whether as a free protein or as a fusion construct with GST, is monomeric and adopts a disordered conformation after GST removal. These results do not rule out the possibility that α-syn becomes structured upon interaction with other proteins and/or biological membranes.",alpha-Synuclein;Parkinson Disease;Protein Conformation;Protein Misfolding;Protein Structure;Intrinsically Disordered;Native-PAGE;Oligomers

In the absence of BamC, these modules are destabilized resulting in increased protease susceptibility of BamD and BamB.

However, we now face the issue of drug resistance due to deregulation in the quality control of both DNA and protein. BCR‐ABL is basically a misfolded protein with intrinsically disordered regions, which not only produces endoplasmic reticulum stress followed by unfolded protein response in some settings, but also conformational plasticity that may affect the structure of the whole molecule. The intercellular signaling derived from the leukemic cell microenvironment may influence the intracellular responses that take place in a manner both dependent on and independent of BCR‐ABL tyrosine kinase activity.",

Although short diphosphorylated peptides derived from Sic1 can bind to Cdc4 with high affinity, through systematic mutagenesis and quantitative biophysical analysis we show that individually weak, dispersed Sic1 phospho sites engage Cdc4 in a dynamic equilibrium. The affinities of individual phosphoepitopes serve to tune the overall phosphorylation site threshold needed for efficient recognition. Notably, phosphoepitope affinity for Cdc4 is dramatically weakened in the context of full-length Sic1, demonstrating the importance of regional environment on binding interactions. The multisite nature of the Sic1-Cdc4 interaction confers cooperative dependence on kinase activity for Sic1 recognition and ubiquitination under equilibrium reaction conditions.

Here, we combine circular dichroism (CD), single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer, and atomistic computer simulations to elucidate salt-specific effects on the structure of three peptides with large α-helical propensity. CD indicates a complex ion-specific destabilization of the α-helix that can be rationalized by using a single salt-free computer simulation in combination with the recently introduced scheme of ion-partitioning between nonpolar and polar peptide surfaces. Simulations including salt provide a molecular underpinning of this partitioning concept. Furthermore, our single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer measurements reveal highly compressed peptide conformations in molar concentrations of NaClO4 in contrast to strong swelling in the presence of GdmCl. The compacted states observed in the presence of NaClO4 originate from a tight ion-backbone network that leads to a highly heterogeneous secondary structure distribution and an overall lower α-helical content that would be estimated from CD. Thus, NaClO4 denatures by inducing a molten globule-like structure that seems completely off-pathway between a fully folded helix and a coil state.",

Nash, moc.liamg@ogacihcu.hsandp","Modular protein interaction domains that recognize linear peptide motifs are found in hundreds of proteins within the human genome. Some protein interaction domains such as SH2, 14-3-3, Chromo and Bromo domains serve to recognize post-translational modification of amino acids (such as phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation etc.) and translate these into discrete cellular responses. Other modules such as SH3 and PDZ domains recognize linear peptide epitopes and serve to organize protein complexes based on localization and regions of elevated concentration. In both cases, the ability to nucleate specific signaling complexes is in large part dependent on the selectivity of a given protein module for its cognate peptide ligand. High throughput analysis of peptide-binding domains by peptide or protein arrays, phage display, mass spectrometry or other HTP techniques provides new insight into the potential protein-protein interactions prescribed by individual or even whole families of modules. Systems level analyses have also promoted a deeper understanding of the underlying principles that govern selective protein-protein interactions and how selectivity evolves. Lastly, there is a growing appreciation for the limitations and potential pitfalls of high-throughput analysis of protein-peptide interactomes. This review will examine some of the common approaches utilized for large-scale studies of protein interaction domains and suggest a set of standards for the analysis and validation of datasets from large-scale studies of peptide-binding modules. We will also highlight how data from large-scale studies of modular interaction domain families can provide insight into systems level properties such as the linguistics of selective interactions.",

However, it has remained unclear how this contribution is distributed along the reaction and what influence it has on the folding dynamics. Here we use a combination of single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer, nanosecond fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, microfluidic mixing and denaturant- and viscosity-dependent protein-folding kinetics to probe internal friction in the unfolded state and at the early and late transition states of slow- and fast-folding spectrin domains. We find that the internal friction affecting the folding rates of spectrin domains is highly localized to the early transition state, suggesting an important role of rather specific interactions in the rate-limiting conformational changes.",

Here, we report that Mpro-C can reversibly interconvert between these two topological states under physiological conditions. Although the swapped α1-helix is fully buried inside the protein hydrophobic core, the interconversion of Mpro-C is carried out without the hydrophobic core being exposed to solvent. The 3D domain swapping of Mpro-C is activated by an order-to-disorder transition of its C-terminal α5-helix foldon. Unfolding of this foldon promotes self-association of Mpro-C monomers and functions to mediate the 3D domain swapping, without which Mpro-C can no longer form the domain-swapped dimer. Taken together, we propose that there exists a special dimeric intermediate enabling the protein core to unpack and the α1-helices to swap in a hydrophobic environment, which minimizes the energy cost of the 3D domain-swapping process.",NMR;protein folding

Conversely, its experimental inactivation elicits oncogene addiction. While MYC constitutes a formidable therapeutic target, it also plays an essential role in normal physiology, thus creating the need for context--specific targeting strategies. The analysis of post-translational MYC activity modulation yields novel targets for MYC inactivation. Specifically, following regulatory network analysis in human B cells, we identify a novel role of the STK38 kinase as a regulator of MYC activity and a candidate target for abrogating tumorigenesis in MYC addicted lymphoma. We found that STK38 regulates MYC protein stability and turnover in a kinase-activity-dependent manner. STK38 kinase inactivation abrogates apoptosis following B-cell receptor (BCR) activation, while its silencing significantly decreases MYC levels and increases apoptosis. Moreover, STK38 knockdown suppresses growth of MYC addicted tumors in vivo thus providing a novel viable target for treating these malignancies.",STK38;MYC post-translational modifications;protein turnover;transcriptional activity;protein-protein interaction

Herein, using an array of biophysical methods, we provide evidence that although Grb2 adaptor can potentially bind to all four PXψPXR motifs — designated herein S1, S2, S3 and S4 — located within the Sos1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, the formation of Grb2-Sos1 signaling complex occurs with a 2:1 stoichiometry. Strikingly, such bivalent binding appears to be driven by the association of Grb2 homodimer to only two out of a four potential PXψPXR motifs within Sos1 at any one time. Of particular interest is the observation that out of a possible six pairwise combinations in which S1–S4 motifs may act in concert for the docking of Grb2 homodimer through bivalent binding, only S1/S3, S1/S4, S2/S4 and S3/S4 do so, while S1/S2 and S2/S3 pairwise combinations appear to only afford monovalent binding. This salient observation implicates the role of local physical constraints in fine tuning the conformational heterogeneity of Grb2-Sos1 signaling complex. Importantly, the presence of multiple binding sites within Sos1 appears to provide a physical route for Grb2 to hop in a flip-flop manner from one site to the next through facilitated diffusion and such rapid exchange forms the basis of positive cooperativity driving the bivalent binding of Grb2 to Sos1 with high affinity. Collectively, our study sheds new light on the assembly of a key macromolecular signaling complex central to cellular machinery in health and disease.",SH3-ligand interactions;Intrinsic disorder;Multivalent binding;Flip-flop hopping;Facilitated diffusion;Positive cooperativity

Among the different forms of Aβ aggregates, low molecular weight species ranging between ∼2- and 50-mers, also called “soluble oligomers,” have emerged as the species responsible for early synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss. Emerging evidence suggests that the neurotoxic oligomers need not be formed along the obligatory nucleation-dependant fibril formation pathway. In our earlier work, we reported the isolation of one such “off-pathway” 12–18-mer species of Aβ42 generated from fatty acids called large fatty acid-derived oligomers (LFAOs) (Kumar, A., Bullard, R. L., Patel, P., Paslay, L. C., Singh, D., Bienkiewicz, E. A., Morgan, S. E., and Rangachari, V. (2011) PLoS One 6, e18759). Here, we report the physiochemical aspects of LFAO-monomer interactions as well as LFAO-LFAO associations in the presence of interfaces. We discovered that LFAOs are a replicating strain of oligomers that recruit Aβ42 monomers and quantitatively convert them into LFAO assemblies at the expense of fibrils, a mechanism similar to prion propagation. We also found that in the presence of hexane-buffer or chloroform-buffer interfaces LFAOs are able to associate with themselves to form larger but non-fibrillar aggregates. These results further support the hypothesis that low molecular weight oligomers can be generated via non-fibril formation pathways. Furthermore, the unique replicating property of off-pathway oligomers may hold profound significance for Alzheimer disease pathology.",Aggregation;Alzheimer Disease;Amyloid;Neurodegeneration;Protein Aggregation;Protein Chemistry

Using the available knowledge of interaction modules, particularly within intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), we analysed the occurrences of protein modules within alternative exons. We find that regions removed or included by pre-translational variation are enriched in linear motifs suggesting that the removal or inclusion of exons containing these interaction modules is an important regulatory mechanism. In particular, we observe that PDZ-, PTB-, SH2- and WW-domain binding motifs are more likely to occur within alternative exons. We also determine that regions removed or included by alternative promoter usage are enriched in IDRs suggesting that protein isoform diversity is tightly coupled to the modulation of IDRs. This study, therefore, demonstrates that short linear motifs are key components for establishing protein diversity between splice variants.",

However, our insight into the organization of these different enzymatic activities into a bioactive tertiary structure remains rudimentary. Fragments of Mononegavirales polymerases analyzed to date cannot restore bioactivity through trans-complementation, unlike the related L proteins of segmented NSVs. We investigated the domain organization of phylogenetically diverse Paramyxovirus L proteins derived from measles virus (MeV), Nipah virus (NiV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Through a comprehensive in silico and experimental analysis of domain intersections, we defined MeV L position 615 as an interdomain candidate in addition to the previously reported residue 1708. Only position 1708 of MeV and the homologous positions in NiV and RSV L also tolerated the insertion of epitope tags. Splitting of MeV L at residue 1708 created fragments that were unable to physically interact and trans-complement, but strikingly, these activities were reconstituted by the addition of dimerization tags to the fragments. Equivalently split fragments of NiV, RSV, and MeV L oligomerized with comparable efficiency in all homo- and heterotypic combinations, but only the homotypic pairs were able to trans-complement. These results demonstrate that synthesis as a single polypeptide is not required for the Mononegavirales polymerases to adopt a proper tertiary conformation. Paramyxovirus polymerases are composed of at least two truly independent folding domains that lack a traditional interface but require molecular compatibility for bioactivity. The functional probing of the L domain architecture through trans-complementation is anticipated to be applicable to all Mononegavirales polymerases.",Protein Domains;RNA Polymerase;RNA Viruses;Viral Polymerase;Viral Replication

In yeast, prion-encoded phenotypes can be beneficial, neutral or deleterious depending upon genetic background and environmental conditions. A distinctive and portable ‘prion domain’ enriched in asparagine, glutamine, tyrosine and glycine residues unifies the majority of yeast prion proteins. Deletion of this domain precludes prionogenesis and appending this domain to reporter proteins can confer prionogenicity. An algorithm designed to detect prion domains has successfully identified 19 domains that can confer prion behavior. Scouring the human genome with this algorithm enriches a select group of RNA-binding proteins harboring a canonical RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a putative prion domain. Indeed, of 210 human RRM-bearing proteins, 29 have a putative prion domain, and 12 of these are in the top 60 prion candidates in the entire genome. Startlingly, these RNA-binding prion candidates are inexorably emerging, one by one, in the pathology and genetics of devastating neurodegenerative disorders, including: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U), Alzheimer’s disease and Huntington’s disease. For example, FUS and TDP-43, which rank 1st and 10th among RRM-bearing prion candidates, form cytoplasmic inclusions in the degenerating motor neurons of ALS patients and mutations in TDP-43 and FUS cause familial ALS. Recently, perturbed RNA-binding proteostasis of TAF15, which is the 2nd ranked RRM-bearing prion candidate, has been connected with ALS and FTLD-U. We strongly suspect that we have now merely reached the tip of the iceberg. We predict that additional RNA-binding prion candidates identified by our algorithm will soon surface as genetic modifiers or causes of diverse neurodegenerative conditions. Indeed, simple prion-like transfer mechanisms involving the prion-like domains of RNA-binding proteins could underlie the classical non-cell-autonomous emanation of neurodegenerative pathology from originating epicenters to neighboring portions of the nervous system.",

Since then, significant efforts have been made to better understand the biology of this virus, but we still have poor knowledge of CHIKV interactions with host cell components at the molecular level. Here we describe the extensive use of high-throughput yeast two-hybrid (HT-Y2H) assays to characterize interactions between CHIKV and human proteins. A total of 22 high-confidence interactions, which essentially involved the viral nonstructural protein nsP2, were identified and further validated in protein complementation assay (PCA). These results were integrated to a larger network obtained by extensive mining of the literature for reports on alphavirus-host interactions. To investigate the role of cellular proteins interacting with nsP2, gene silencing experiments were performed in cells infected by a recombinant CHIKV expressing Renilla luciferase as a reporter. Collected data showed that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP-K) and ubiquilin 4 (UBQLN4) participate in CHIKV replication in vitro. In addition, we showed that CHIKV nsP2 induces a cellular shutoff, as previously reported for other Old World alphaviruses, and determined that among binding partners identified by yeast two-hybrid methods, the tetratricopeptide repeat protein 7B (TTC7B) plays a significant role in this activity. Altogether, this report provides the first interaction map between CHIKV and human proteins and describes new host cell proteins involved in the replication cycle of this virus.",

This relaxed structure allows IDRs, which are implicated in the regulation of transcription and translation, to bind multiple ligands. Originally the nucleotide variability seen in the HEV PPR was assumed to be due to high rates of insertion and deletion. This study shows that the mutation rate is about the same in the PPR as in the rest of the nonstructural polyprotein. The difference between the PPR and the rest of the polyprotein is due to the higher tolerance of the PPR for substitutions at the first and second codon positions. With this higher promiscuity there is a shift in nucleotide occupation of these codons leading to translation of more cytosine residues: a shift that leads to more proline, alanine, serine, and threonine being encoded rather than histidine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. This pattern of amino acid usage is typical of proline-rich IDRs. Increased usage of cytosine also leads to >22% of all amino acids in the PPR being prolines. Alignments of PPR sequences from HEV strains representing all genotypes indicate that all zoonotic isolates share an ancestor, and the carboxyl half of the PPR is more tolerant of mutations than the amino half. The evolution of HEV PPR, in contrast with that of the rest of the nonstructural polyprotein, is molded by pressures that lead toward increased proline usage with a corresponding decrease in the usage of aromatic amino acids, favoring formation of IDR structures.",

One factor that has been shown to influence the aggregation propensity is the oxidation state of the protein itself. Tau protein, which contains two naturally occurring cysteine residues, can form both intermolecular disulfide bonds and intramolecular disulfide bonds. Several studies suggest that intermolecular disulfide bonds can promote tau aggregation in vitro. By contrast, although there are data to suggest that intramolecular disulfide bond formation retards tau aggregation in vitro, the precise mechanism underlying this observation remains unclear. While it has been hypothesized that a single intramolecular disulfide bond in tau leads to compact conformations that cannot form extended structure consistent with tau fibrils, there are few data to support this conjecture. In the present study we generate oxidized forms of the truncation mutant, K18, which contains all four microtubule binding repeats, and isolate the monomeric fraction, which corresponds to K18 monomers that have a single intramolecular disulfide bond. We study the aggregation propensity of the oxidized monomeric fraction and relate these data to an atomistic model of the K18 unfolded ensemble. Our results argue that the main effect of intramolecular disulfide bond formation is to preferentially stabilize conformers within the unfolded ensemble that place the aggregation-prone tau subsequences, PHF6* and PHF6, in conformations that are inconsistent with the formation of cross-β-structure.

The results demonstrate that C-peptide is largely unstructured independent of pH, but that a weak structural induction towards a short stretch of β-sheet is induced at low pH, corresponding to the isoelectric point of the peptide. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that C-peptide associates with neutral phospholipid bicelles as well as acidic phospholipid bicelles at this low pH. C-peptide does not undergo a large structural rearrangement as a consequence of lipid interaction, which indicates that the folding and binding are uncoupled. In vivo, local variations in environment, including pH, may cause C-peptide to associate with lipids, which may affect the aggregation state of the peptide.",

They include Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Occupational and environmental exposure to manganese (Mn) is associated with a neurological syndrome consisting of psychiatric symptoms, cognitive impairment and parkinsonism. In this study, we examined α-syn immunoreactivity in the frontal cortex of Cynomolgus macaques as part of a multidisciplinary assessment of the neurological effects produced by exposure to moderate levels of Mn. We found increased α-syn-positive cells in the gray matter of Mn-exposed animals, typically observed in pyramidal and medium-sized neurons in deep cortical layers. Some of these neurons displayed loss of Nissl staining with α-syn-positive spherical aggregates. In the white matter we also observed α-syn-positive glial cells and in some cases α-syn-positive neurites. These findings suggest that Mn exposure promotes α-syn aggregation in neuronal and glial cells that may ultimately lead to degeneration in the frontal cortex gray and white matter. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Mn-induced neuronal and glial cell α-syn accumulation and aggregation in the frontal cortex of non-human primates.",Synucleinopathies;Manganese;Frontal cortex;α-synuclein;Neurotoxicity;Non-human primates

wild-type Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides are linked to Alzheimer’s
disease. Recently, the E22Δ genetic missense mutation was detected
in patients exhibiting Alzheimer’s-disease type dementia. However,
detailed knowledge about the E22Δ mutant-type Aβ40 and
Aβ42 alloform structures as well as the differences from the
wild-type Aβ40 and Aβ42 alloform structures is currently
lacking. In this study, we present the structures of the E22Δ
mutant-type Aβ40 and Aβ42 alloforms as well as the impact
of E22Δ mutation on the wild-type Aβ40 and Aβ42
alloform structures. For this purpose, we performed extensive microsecond-time
scale parallel tempering molecular dynamics simulations coupled with
thermodynamic calculations. For studying the residual secondary structure
component transition stabilities, we developed and applied a new theoretical
strategy in our studies. We find that the E22Δ mutant-type Aβ40
might have a higher tendency toward aggregation due to more abundant β-sheet
formation in the C-terminal region in comparison to the E22Δ
mutant-type Aβ42 peptide. More abundant α-helix is formed
in the mid-domain regions of the E22Δ mutant-type Aβ alloforms
rather than in their wild-type forms. The turn structure at Ala21-Ala30
of the wild-type Aβ, which has been linked to the aggregation
process, is less abundant upon E22Δ mutation of both Aβ
alloforms. Intramolecular interactions between the N-terminal and
central hydrophobic core (CHC), N- and C-terminal, and CHC and C-terminal
regions are less abundant or disappear in the E22Δ mutant-type
Aβ alloform structures. The thermodynamic trends indicate that
the wild-type Aβ42 tends to aggregate more than the wild-type
Aβ40 peptide, which is in agreement with experiments. However,
this trend is vice versa for the E22Δ mutant-type alloforms.
The structural properties of the E22Δ mutant-type Aβ40
and Aβ42 peptides reported herein may prove useful for the development
of new drugs to block the formation of toxic E22Δ mutant-type
oligomers by either stabilizing helical or destabilizing β-sheet

We present a previously unrecognized way of controlling Ph function through modulation of its sterile alpha motif (SAM) polymerization leading to the identification of a novel target for tuning the activities of proteins. SAM domain containing proteins have been shown to require SAM polymerization for proper function. However, the role of the Ph SAM polymer in PcG-mediated gene silencing was uncertain. Here, we first show that Ph SAM polymerization is indeed required for its gene silencing function. Interestingly, the unstructured linker sequence N-terminal to Ph SAM can shorten the length of polymers compared with when Ph SAM is individually isolated. Substituting the native linker with a random, unstructured sequence (RLink) can still limit polymerization, but not as well as the native linker. Consequently, the increased polymeric Ph RLink exhibits better gene silencing ability. In the Drosophila wing disc, Ph RLink expression suppresses growth compared with no effect for wild-type Ph, and opposite to the overgrowth phenotype observed for polymer-deficient Ph mutants. These data provide the first demonstration that the inherent activity of a protein containing a polymeric SAM can be enhanced by increasing SAM polymerization. Because the SAM linker had not been previously considered important for the function of SAM-containing proteins, our finding opens numerous opportunities to manipulate linker sequences of hundreds of polymeric SAM proteins to regulate a diverse array of intracellular functions.",Chromatin Structure;Gene Regulation;Intrinsically Disordered Proteins;Polycomb;Protein Structure

Intermolecular interactions mediated by proline-rich motifs (PRMs) are observed in many facets of the immune response. The proline-rich regions are known to preferentially adopt a polyproline type II helical conformation, an extended structure that facilitates transient intermolecular interactions such as signal transduction, antigen recognition, cell-cell communication and cytoskeletal organization. The propensity of both the side chain and the backbone carbonyls of the polyproline type II helix to participate in the interface interaction makes it an excellent recognition motif. An advantage of such distinct chemical features is that the interactions can be discriminatory even in the absence of high affinities. Indeed, the immune response is mediated by well-orchestrated low-affinity short-duration intermolecular interactions. The proline-rich regions are predominantly localized in the solvent-exposed regions such as the loops, intrinsically disordered regions, or between domains that constitute the intermolecular interface. Peptide mimics of the PRM have been suggested as potential antagonists of intermolecular interactions. In this paper, we discuss novel PRM-mediated interactions in the human immunome that potentially serve as attractive targets for immunomodulation and drug development for inflammatory and autoimmune pathologies.",

Herein, using an array of biophysical techniques, we show that while Grb2 exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium, the proline-rich (PR) domain of Gab1 is a monomer in solution. Of particular interest is the observation that although the PR domain appears to be structurally disordered, it nonetheless adopts a more or less compact conformation reminiscent of natively-folded globular proteins. Importantly, the structurally flexible conformation of the PR domain appears to facilitate the binding of Gab1 to Grb2 with a 1:2 stoichiometry. More specifically, the formation of Grb2-Gab1 signaling complex is driven via a bivalent interaction through the binding of cSH3 domain within each monomer of Grb2 homodimer to two distinct RXXK motifs, herein designated G1 and G2, located within the PR domain of Gab1. Strikingly, in spite of the key role of bivalency in driving this macromolecular assembly, the cSH3 domains bind to G1 and G2 motifs in an independent manner with zero cooperativity. Taken together, our study sheds new light on the physicochemical forces driving the assembly of a key macromolecular signaling complex pertinent to cellular health and disease.",Macromolecular assembly;SH3-ligand interactions;Intrinsic disorder;Multivalent binding;Zero cooperativity

Aggregation is followed by formation of a collapsed protein-SDS micelle complex, which is consistent with experimental results. Finally, interaction of αSyn with preformed micelles induces alterations in the shape of the micelle, and the N-terminal helix (residues 3 through 37) tends to associate with micelles.

Unique among capping proteins, Tmods also bind tropomyosins (TMs), which greatly enhance the actin filament pointed-end capping activity of Tmods. Tmods are defined by a tropomyosin (TM)-regulated/Pointed-End Actin Capping (TM-Cap) domain in their unstructured N-terminal portion, followed by a compact, folded Leucine-Rich Repeat/Pointed-End Actin Capping (LRR-Cap) domain. By inhibiting actin monomer association and dissociation from pointed ends, Tmods regulate regulate actin dynamics and turnover, stabilizing actin filament lengths and cytoskeletal architecture. In this review, we summarize the genes, structural features, molecular and biochemical properties, actin regulatory mechanisms, expression patterns, and cell and tissue functions of Tmods. By understanding Tmods’ functions in the context of their molecular structure, actin regulation, binding partners, and related variants (leiomodins 1–3), we can draw broad conclusions that can explain the diverse morphological and functional phenotypes that arise from Tmod perturbation experiments in vitro and in vivo.

Over the past twenty years, much has been learned about the factors that influence the propensity of TTR to aggregate. This biophysical information led to the development of a therapeutic strategy, termed “kinetic stabilization”, to prevent TTR amyloidogenesis.

This ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex is the template for replication and transcription by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. RNP recognition by the viral polymerase involves a specific interaction between the C-terminal domain of the phosphoprotein (P) (PCTD) and N. However, the P binding region on N remains to be identified. In this study, glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assays were used to identify the N-terminal core domain of HRSV N (NNTD) as a P binding domain. A biochemical characterization of the PCTD and molecular modeling of the NNTD allowed us to define four potential candidate pockets on N (pocket I [PI] to PIV) as hydrophobic sites surrounded by positively charged regions, which could constitute sites complementary to the PCTD interaction domain. The role of selected amino acids in the recognition of the N-RNA complex by P was first screened for by site-directed mutagenesis using a polymerase activity assay, based on an HRSV minigenome containing a luciferase reporter gene. When changed to Ala, most of the residues of PI were found to be critical for viral RNA synthesis, with the R132A mutant having the strongest effect.

One way to treat tauopathies may be to accelerate tau clearance, but the molecular mechanisms governing tau stability are not yet clear. We recently identified chemical probes that markedly accelerate the clearance of tau in cellular and animal models. In the current study, we used one of these probes in combination with immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry to identify 48 proteins whose association with tau changes during the first 10 minutes after treatment. These proteins included known modifiers of tau proteotoxicity, such as ILF-2 (NFAT), ILF-3, and ataxin-2. A striking observation from the dataset was that tau binding to heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) decreased while binding to Hsp90 significantly increased. Both chaperones have been linked to tau homeostasis, but their mechanisms have not been established. Using peptide arrays and binding assays, we found that Hsp70 and Hsp90 appeared to compete for binding to shared sites on tau. Further, the Hsp90-bound complex proved to be important in initiating tau clearance in cells. These results suggest that the relative levels of Hsp70 and Hsp90 may help determine whether tau is retained or degraded. Consistent with this model, analysis of reported microarray expression data from Alzheimer’s disease patients and age-matched controls showed that the levels of Hsp90 are reduced in the diseased hippocampus. These studies suggest that Hsp70 and Hsp90 work together to coordinate tau homeostasis.",

They favour compact protein states which makes them stabilize globular proteins in vitro and promote folding. Conversely, this preference for compact states promotes aggregation of unstructured proteins. Here we combine a brief review of the effect of osmolytes on protein fibrillation with a report of the effect of osmolytes on the unstructured peptide hormone glucagon. Our results show that osmolytes either accelerate the fibrillation kinetics or leave them unaffected, with the exception of the osmolyte taurine. Furthermore, the osmolytes that affected the shape of the fibrillation time profile led to fibrils with different structure as revealed by CD. The structural changes induced by Pro, Ser and choline-O-sulfate could be due to specific osmolytes binding to the peptides, stabilizing an otherwise labile fibrillation intermediate.",glucagon;amyloid;taurine;polymorphism;fibrillation mechanism

The ability to form toxic amyloids appears to be a property of most polypeptides. Accordingly, it has been proposed that reducing aggregation and its effect in cell fitness is a driving force in the evolution of proteins sequences. This control of protein solubility should be especially important for regulatory hubs in biological networks, like protein kinases. These enzymes are implicated in practically all processes in normal and abnormal cell physiology, and phosphorylation is one of the most frequent protein modifications used to control protein activity. Here, we use the AGGRESCAN algorithm to study the aggregation propensity of kinase sequences. We compared them with the rest of globular proteins to decipher whether they display differential aggregation properties. In addition, we compared the human kinase complement with the kinomes of other organisms to see if we can identify any evolutionary trend in the aggregational properties of this protein superfamily. Our analysis indicates that kinase domains display significant aggregation propensity, a property that decreases with increasing organism complexity.",protein kinases;protein aggregation;amyloid;protein evolution;AGGRESCAN

However, the conformational changes and interactions of PDE6 with known interacting proteins are poorly understood. Using a fluorescence detection system for the analytical ultracentrifuge, we examined allosteric changes in PDE6 structure and protein-protein interactions with its inhibitory γ-subunit, the prenyl-binding protein (PrBP/δ), and activated transducin. In solution, the PDE6 catalytic dimer (Pαβ) exhibits a more asymmetric shape (axial ratio of 6.6) than reported previously. The inhibitory Pγ subunit behaves as an intrinsically disordered protein in solution but binds with high affinity to the catalytic dimer to reconstitute the holoenzyme without a detectable change in shape. Whereas the closely related PDE5 homodimer undergoes a significant change in its sedimentation properties upon cGMP binding to its regulatory cGMP binding site, no such change was detected upon ligand binding to the PDE6 catalytic dimer. However, when Pαβ was reconstituted with Pγ truncation mutants lacking the C-terminal inhibitory region, cGMP-dependent allosteric changes were observed. PrBP/δ bound to the PDE6 holoenzyme with high affinity (KD = 6.2 nm) and induced elongation of the protein complex. Binding of activated transducin to PDE6 holoenzyme resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in the sedimentation coefficient, reflecting a dynamic equilibrium between transducin and PDE6. We conclude that allosteric regulation of PDE6 is more complex than for PDE5 and is dependent on interactions of regions of Pγ with the catalytic dimer.",Allosteric Regulation;Analytical Ultracentrifugation;Cyclic GMP (cGMP);Cyclic Nucleotides;Phosphodiesterases;Photoreceptors;Protein Conformation;Signal Transduction;PDE6;Transducin;Visual Transduction;Prenyl-binding Protein;Analytical Ultracentrifugation

It is expressed in brain and heart tissue, where it plays a crucial role as a modulator of Ca2+ homeostasis, energy metabolism, neurotransmitter release, and contractile performance. Biological effects of S100A1 have been attributed to its direct interaction with a variety of target proteins. The (patho)physiological relevance of S100A1 makes it an important molecular target for future therapeutic intervention. S-Nitrosylation is a post-translational modification of proteins, which plays a role in cellular signal transduction under physiological and pathological conditions. In this study, we confirmed that S100A1 protein is endogenously modified by Cys85
S-nitrosylation in PC12 cells, which are a well established model system for studying S100A1 function. We used isothermal calorimetry to show that S-nitrosylation facilitates the formation of Ca2+-loaded S100A1 at physiological ionic strength conditions. To establish the unique influence of the S-nitroso group, our study describes high resolution three-dimensional structures of human apo-S100A1 protein with the Cys85 thiol group in reduced and S-nitrosylated states. Solution structures of the proteins are based on NMR data obtained at physiological ionic strength. Comparative analysis shows that S-nitrosylation fine tunes the overall architecture of S100A1 protein. Although the typical S100 protein intersubunit four-helix bundle is conserved upon S-nitrosylation, the conformation of S100A1 protein is reorganized at the sites most important for target recognition (i.e. the C-terminal helix and the linker connecting two EF-hand domains). In summary, this study discloses cysteine S-nitrosylation as a new factor responsible for increasing functional diversity of S100A1 and helps explain the role of S100A1 as a Ca2+ signal transmitter sensitive to NO/redox equilibrium within cells.",Calcium-binding Proteins;NMR;Protein Structure;S-Nitrosylation;S100 Proteins

Active protein trafficking into and out of the nucleus is dependent on the presence within cargo proteins of intrinsic specific modular signals for nuclear import (nuclear localization signals, NLSs) and export (nuclear export signals, NESs). Rabies virus (RabV) phospho (P) protein, which is largely responsible for antagonising the host anti-viral response, is expressed as five isoforms (P1–P5). The subcellular trafficking of these isoforms is thought to depend on a balance between the activities of a dominant N-terminal NES (N-NES) and a distinct C-terminal NLS (C-NLS). Specifically, the N-NES-containing isoforms P1 and P2 are cytoplasmic, whereas the shorter P3–P5 isoforms, which lack the N-NES, are believed to be nuclear through the activity of the C-NLS. Here, we show for the first time that RabV P contains an additional strong NLS in the N-terminal region (N-NLS), which, intriguingly, overlaps with the N-NES. This arrangement represents a novel nuclear trafficking module where the N-NLS is inactive in P1 but becomes activated in P3, concomitant with truncation of the N-NES, to become the principal targeting signal conferring nuclear accumulation. Understanding this unique switch arrangement of overlapping, co-regulated NES/NLS sequences is vital to delineating the critical role of RabV P protein in viral infection.",Intracellular Trafficking;Nuclear Pore;Nuclear Translocation;Nuclear Transport;Viral Protein

Consensus mutations [Y254L/T257A (YLTA) and C186P/A220P (CPAP)] stabilize the naturally occuring AR domain of human IκBα to denaturation; however, only the YLTA mutations stabilize the protein to proteasomal degradation. We present results from NMR experiments designed to probe the roles of these consensus mutations in IκBα. According to residual dipolar coupling analysis, the gross structures of the AR domains of both mutants appear to be similar to the wild type (WT). Comparison of chemical shifts of mutant and WT proteins reveals that the YLTA and CPAP consensus mutations cause unexpected long-range effects throughout the AR domains. Backbone dynamics experiments reveal that the YLTA mutations in the sixth AR order the C-terminal PEST sequence on the picosecond-to-nanosecond timescale, compared to either the WT or the CPAP mutant IκBαs.

Upon heating, these peaks weaken, while a weak negative signal develops at 222 nm. At high TFE concentrations, the spectra show distinct minima at 208 and 222 nm, indicative of considerable α-helical structure, which diminish upon heating.

The purpose of the present study was to explore this potential using 38 singly spin-labeled mutants of myoglobin distributed throughout the sequence. Correlation of the EPR spectra with protein structure provides new evidence that the site dependent variation in lineshape, and hence motion of the spin label, is due largely to differences in mobility of the helical backbone in the ns time range. Fluctuations between conformational substates, typically in the μs-ms time range, are slow on the EPR time scale and the spectra provide a snapshot of conformational equilibria frozen in time as revealed by multiple components in the spectra. A recent study showed that osmolyte perturbation can positively identify conformational exchange as the origin of multicomponent spectra (Lopez et al. (2009), Protein Sci. 18, 1637). In the present study this new strategy is employed in combination with lineshape analysis and pulsed-EPR interspin distance measurements to investigate the conformation and flexibility of myoglobin in three folded and partially folded states.

","The number of proteasomal substrates that are degraded without prior ubiquitylation continues to grow. However, it remains poorly understood how the proteasome recognizes substrates lacking a ubiquitin (Ub) signal. Here we demonstrated that the Ub-independent degradation of Rpn4 requires the 19S regulatory particle (RP). The Ub-independent degron of Rpn4 was mapped to an N-terminal region including the first 80 residues. Inspection of its amino acid sequence revealed that the Ub-independent degron of Rpn4 consists of an intrinsically disordered domain followed by a folded segment. Using a photo-crosslinking-label transfer method, we captured three 19S RP subunits (Rpt1, Rpn2 and Rpn5) that bind the Ub-independent degron of Rpn4. This is the first time that specific 19S RP subunits have been identified interacting with a Ub-independent degron. This study provides insight into the mechanism by which Ub-independent substrates are recruited to the 26S proteasome.",Proteasome;Protein degradation;Ubiquitin-independent;Degron;Rpn4

Loh: ude.etatspu@shol ","Protein conformational switches alter their shape upon receiving an input signal, such as ligand binding, chemical modification, or change in environment. The apparent simplicity of this transformation—which can be carried out by a molecule as small as a thousand atoms or so—belies its critical importance to the life of the cell as well as its capacity for engineering by humans. In the realm of molecular switches, proteins are unique because they are capable of performing a variety of biological functions. Switchable proteins are therefore of high interest to the fields of biology, bio-technology, and medicine. These molecules are beginning to be exploited as the core machinery behind a new generation of biosensors, functionally regulated enzymes, and “smart” biomaterials that react to their surroundings. As inspirations for these designs, researchers continue to analyze existing examples of allosteric proteins. Recent years have also witnessed the development of new methodologies for introducing conformational change into proteins that previously had none. Herein we review examples of both natural and engineered protein switches in the context of four basic modes of conformational change: rigid-body domain movement, limited structural rearrangement, global fold switching, and folding–unfolding. Our purpose is to highlight examples that can potentially serve as platforms for the design of custom switches. Accordingly, we focus on inducible conformational changes that are substantial enough to produce a functional response (e.g., in a second protein to which it is fused), yet are relatively simple, structurally well-characterized, and amenable to protein engineering efforts.",allostery;biosensors;protein design;protein engineering;protein folding

","The results of more than a dozen single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) experiments suggest that chemically unfolded polypeptides invariably collapse from an expanded random coil to more compact dimensions as the denaturant concentration is reduced. In sharp contrast, small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) studies suggest that, at least for single domain proteins at non-zero denaturant concentrations, such compaction may be rare. Here we explore this discrepancy by studying protein L, a protein previously studied by SAXS (at 5°C), which suggested fixed unfolded-state dimensions from 1.4 to 5 M guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl), and by smFRET (at 25°C), which suggested that, in contrast, the chain contracts by 15-30% over this same denaturant range. Repeating the earlier SAXS study under the same conditions employed in the smFRET studies we observe little if any evidence that the unfolded state of protein L contracts as the concentration of GuHCl is reduced. For example, scattering profiles (and thus the shape and dimensions) collected within ~4 ms after dilution to as low as 0.67 M GuHCl are effectively indistinguishable from those observed at equilibrium at higher denaturant. Our results thus argue that the disagreement between SAXS and smFRET is statistically significant, and that the experimental evidence in favor of obligate polypeptide collapse at low denaturant cannot yet be considered conclusive.",physiological unfolded state;hydrophobic collapse;non-specific;coil-to-globule

As all forms of MSP2 can be categorized into two allelic families, a vaccine containing two representative forms of MSP2 may overcome the problem of diversity in this highly polymorphic protein. Monomeric recombinant MSP2 is an intrinsically unstructured protein, but its conformational properties on the merozoite surface are unknown. This question is addressed here by analyzing the 3D7 and FC27 forms of recombinant and parasite MSP2 using a panel of monoclonal antibodies raised against recombinant MSP2. The epitopes of all antibodies, mapped using both a peptide array and by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy on full-length recombinant MSP2, were shown to be linear. The antibodies revealed antigenic differences, which indicate that the conserved N- and C-terminal regions, but not the central variable region, are less accessible in the parasite antigen. This appears to be an intrinsic property of parasite MSP2 and is not dependent on interactions with other merozoite surface proteins as the loss of some conserved-region epitopes seen using the immunofluorescence assay (IFA) on parasite smears was also seen on Western blot analyses of parasite lysates. Further studies of the structural basis of these antigenic differences are required in order to optimize recombinant MSP2 constructs being evaluated as potential vaccine components.",

In this context, it has been proposed that methylation of K9 and phosphorylation of S10 in the tail of histone H3 represent a binary switch that controls its reversible association to heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). To test this hypothesis, we performed a comprehensive molecular dynamics study in which we analyzed a crystallographically defined complex that involves the HP1 chromodomain and an H3 tail peptide. Microsecond-long simulations show that the binding of the trimethylated K9 H3 peptide in the aromatic cage of HP1 is only slightly affected by S10 phosphorylation, because the modified K9 and S10 do not interact directly with one another. Instead, the phosphate group of S10 seems to form a persistent intramolecular salt bridge with R8, an interaction that can provoke a major structural change and alter the hydrogen-bonding regime in the H3-HP1 complex. These observations suggest that interactions between adjacent methyl-lysine and phosphoserine side chains do not by themselves provide a binary switch in the H3-HP1 system, but arginine-phosphoserine interactions, which occur in both histones and nonhistone proteins in the context of a conserved RKS motif, are likely to serve a key regulatory function.",

Normal mode analysis and an elastic network model were applied to a set of protein complexes to calculate the residue fluctuations and develop the residue classification. Comparison with a classification based on normalized B-factors suggests that the B-factors may underestimate protein flexibility in solvent. Our classification shows that protein loops and disordered fragments are enriched with highly fluctuating residues and depleted with weakly fluctuating residues. Strategies for engineering thermostable proteins are discussed. To calculate the dihedral angles distribution functions, the configuration space was divided into cells by a cubic grid. The effect of protein association on the distribution functions depends on the amino acid type and a grid step in the dihedral angles space. The changes in the dihedral angles increase from the near-backbone dihedral angle to the most distant one, for most residues.

Kinase activity is embedded within a conserved kinase core, which is typically regulated by associated domains, linkers and interacting proteins. Moreover, protein kinases are often tethered to large macromolecular complexes to provide tighter spatiotemporal control. Thus, structural characterization of kinase domains alone is insufficient to explain protein kinase function and regulation in vivo. Recent progress in structural characterization of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) exemplifies how our knowledge of kinase signalling has evolved by shifting the focus of structural studies from single kinase subunits to macromolecular complexes.",

This is not the case in sly1 and gid2 F-box mutants, which accumulate much more DELLA protein but show less severe GA-insensitive phenotypes than either GA biosynthesis or GA receptor null mutants (McGinnis et al., 2003; Willige et al., 2007; Ueguchi-Tanaka et al., 2008). It appears that DELLA can be inactivated by a nonproteolytic mechanism such that not all of the DELLA protein that accumulates in sly1/gid2 mutants is functional as a repressor of GA signaling (Ariizumi and Steber, 2007; Ariizumi et al., 2008; Ueguchi-Tanaka et al., 2008). A model in which DELLA repression is blocked by GID1-GA-DELLA complex formation alone was proposed based on the following evidence: (1) sly1/gid2 phenotypes are rescued by GID1 gene overexpression without a reduction in DELLA protein levels; and (2) GA signaling in sly1/gid2 requires all of the elements required for GID1-GA-DELLA complex formation, including GA hormone synthesis, the GID1 gene, and the DELLA domain required for DELLA-GID1 protein interaction. In light of this, it appears that GID1 causes GA signaling in sly1 mutants by binding DELLA protein rather than by triggering DELLA proteolysis (Fig. 1B). Unlike Arabidopsis GID1a and GID1c, the GID1b protein binds GA with a higher affinity and shows some ability to interact with DELLA in the absence of GA. This explains why GID1b overexpression better rescues GA-insensitive sly1 mutant phenotypes (Ariizumi et al., 2008; Yamamoto et al., 2010). This GA-independent GID1b-DELLA binding may provide a low level of GA signaling in the absence of GA. Arabidopsis GID1b tends to have low expression levels, suggesting that control of GID1b accumulation may be essential to regulating basal GA responses (Griffiths et al., 2006; Willige et al., 2007). Because DELLA cannot be degraded in the sly1/gid2 F-box mutants, this background provides a tool for examining GA signaling mechanisms that precede DELLA destruction or may occur in situations where DELLA destruction is delayed by ethylene signaling or lack of auxin signaling (Achard et al., 2003; Fu and Harberd, 2003). Determining the contribution of proteolysis-independent DELLA down-regulation to GA signaling without using a sly1/gid2 background requires the ability to directly assay DELLA protein function as well as its accumulation. Phenotypic assays are not useful here, since phenotype is the sum of events over time and can be influenced by multiple signaling pathways. Future work will need to develop a direct assay for DELLA function or use DELLA-regulated promoters as reporters.",

Plasticity of the cAMP signaling in the striatum is thought to play an essential role in the development of drug addiction. Here, we show that the complex between ninth regulator of G protein signaling (RGS9-2) and type 5 G protein β subunit (Gβ5), critically controls dopamine and opioid GPCRs signaling to AC5 in the striatum. We found that RGS9-2/Gβ5 suppressed basal and Gβγ sensitized activity of AC5 by a mechanism that involved both a direct RGS9-2/Gβ5-AC5 protein-protein interaction and the GTPase stimulatory action of the RGS9-2/Gβ5 complex. Furthermore, RGS9-2/Gβ5 increased the deactivation rate of the inhibitory G protein signaling on AC5. Mice lacking Gβ5-RGS complexes showed increased cAMP production and enhanced sensitization of AC5 upon withdrawal from opioid administration. Our findings establish RGS9-2/Gβ5 complexes as regulators of three key aspects of cAMP signaling: the basal activity, sensitization and temporal kinetics of adenylyl cyclase, thus highlighting the role of these RGS proteins in regulating both inhibitory and stimulatory GPCRs that shape cAMP signaling in the striatum.",

However, insights into the structural properties of mfps have lagged far behind the nanomechanical advances, owing in part to the inability of these proteins to crystallize as well as their limited solubility. Here, solution secondary structures of mfp-1, mfp-2, and mfp-3, localized in the mussel byssal cuticle, adhesive plaque, and plaque–substratum interface, respectively, were investigated using circular dichroism. All three have significant extended coil solution structure, but two, mfp-1 and mfp-2, appear to have punctuated regions of structure separated by unstructured domains. Apart from its punctuated distribution, the structure in mfp-1 resembles other structural proteins such as collagen and plant cell-wall proteins with prominent polyproline II helical structure. As in collagen, PP II structure of mfp-1 is incrementally disrupted by increasing the temperature and by raising pH. However, no recognizable change in mfp-1's PP II structure was evident with the addition with Ca2+ and Fe3+. In contrast, mfp-2 exhibits Ca2+- and disulfide-stabilized epidermal growth factor-like domains separated by unstructured sequence. Mfp-2 showed calcium-binding ability. Bound calcium in mfp-2 was not removed by chelation at pH 5.5, but it was released upon reduction of disulfide bonds.

However, the umuD homolog (umuDAb) present throughout the Acinetobacter genus encodes an extra N-terminal region, and in A. baylyi, regulates transcription of DNA-damage induced genes. UmuDAb expressed in cells was correspondingly larger (24 kDa) than the Escherichia coli UmuD (15 kDa). DNA damage from mitomycin C or UV exposure caused UmuDAb cleavage in both E. coli wild type and ΔumuD cells on a timescale resembling UmuD, but did not require UmuD. Like the self-cleaving serine proteases LexA and UmuD, UmuDAb required RecA for cleavage. This cleavage produced a UmuDAb′ fragment of a size consistent with the predicted cleavage site of Ala83-Gly84. Site-directed mutations at Ala83 abolished cleavage, as did mutations at either the Ser119 or Lys156 predicted enzymatic residues. Co-expression of the cleavage site mutant and an enzymatic mutant did not allow cleavage, demonstrating a strictly intramolecular mechanism of cleavage that more closely resembles the LexA-type repressors than UmuD. These data show that UmuDAb undergoes a post-translational, LexA-like cleavage event after DNA damage, possibly to achieve its regulatory action.",DNA damage;serine protease;UmuD;LexA;SOS response

Cryo-electron tomography resolved the acuna inner structure as a scaffold of highly condensed colloidal masses interlinked by thin beaded threads, which were perceived as fuzziness by atomic force microscopy. On the basis of the combined data, we propose a sequential mechanism comprising molecular, colloidal, and fibrillar stages linked by reactions with disparate temperature dependencies and distinct supramolecular forms. We anticipate novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to Parkinson's and related neurodegenerative diseases based on these new insights into the aggregation mechanism of α-synuclein and intermediates, some of which may act to cause and/or reinforce neurotoxicity.",

Such studies are greatly facilitated by the extensive ‘toolbox’ available to the yeast researcher that provides a range of cell engineering options. Consequently, a number of assays at the cell and molecular level have been set up to report on specific protein misfolding events associated with endogenous or heterologous proteins. One major target is the mammalian prion protein PrP because we know little about what specific sequence and/or structural feature(s) of PrP are important for its conversion to the infectious prion form, PrPSc.

We used a large number of molecular dynamics trajectories of non-homologous proteins as references and examined static structural features of proteins that are most relevant to fluctuations. We examined correlation of individual structural features with fluctuations and further investigated effective combinations of features for predicting the real-value of residue fluctuations using the support vector regression. It was found that some structural features have higher correlation than crystallographic B-factors with fluctuations observed in molecular dynamics trajectories. Moreover, support vector regression that uses combinations of static structural features showed accurate prediction of fluctuations with an average Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.669 and a root mean square error of 1.04 Å. This correlation coefficient is higher than the one observed for the prediction by the Gaussian network model. An advantage of the developed method over the Gaussian network models is that the former predicts the real-value of fluctuation.

This is achieved by the formation of synaptic signal complexes, in which mGluRs assemble with functionally related proteins such as enzymes, scaffolds, and cytoskeletal anchor proteins. Thus, mGluR associated proteins actively participate in the regulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission. Importantly, dysfunction of mGluRs and interacting proteins may lead to impaired signal transduction and finally result in neurological disorders, e.g., night blindness, addiction, epilepsy, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders and Parkinson's disease. In contrast to solved crystal structures of extracellular N-terminal domains of some mGluR types, only a few studies analyzed the conformation of intracellular receptor domains. Intracellular C-termini of most mGluR types are subject to alternative splicing and can be further modified by phosphorylation and SUMOylation. In this way, diverse interaction sites for intracellular proteins that bind to and regulate the glutamate receptors are generated. Indeed, most of the known mGluR binding partners interact with the receptors' C-terminal domains. Within the last years, different laboratories analyzed the structure of these domains and described the geometry of the contact surface between mGluR C-termini and interacting proteins.

To test the validity of random polymer models for PEVK, we determined the mean end-to-end distances of an 11- and a 21-residue synthetic PEVK peptide, calculated from the efficiency of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between an N-terminal intrinsic tryptophan donor and a synthetically added C-terminal IAEDANS acceptor obtained in steady-state and time-resolved experiments. We find that the contour-length scaling of mean end-to-end distance deviates from predictions of a purely statistical polymer chain. Furthermore, the addition of guanidine hydrochloride decreased, whereas the addition of salt increased the FRET efficiency, pointing at the disruption of structure-stabilizing interactions. Increasing temperature between 10 and 50°C increased the normalized FRET efficiency in both peptides but with different trajectories, indicating that their elasticity and conformational stability are different. Simulations suggest that whereas the short PEVK peptide displays an overall random structure, the long PEVK peptide retains residual, loose helical configurations. Transitions in the local structure and dynamics of the PEVK domain may play a role in the modulation of passive muscle mechanics.",

Therefore, understanding the role of Tmod is very important when studying actin filament dependent processes such as muscle contraction and intracellular transport. The capping ability of Tmod is highly influenced by TM and is 1000-fold greater in the presence of TM. There are four Tmod isoforms (Tmod1–4), three of which, Tmod1, Tmod3, and Tmod4, are expressed in skeletal muscles. The affinity of Tmod1 to skeletal striated TM (stTM) is higher than that of Tmod3 and Tmod4 to stTM. In this study, we tested mutations in the TM-binding sites of Tmod1, using circular dichroism (CD) and prediction analysis (PONDR). The mutations R11K, D12N, and Q144K were chosen because they decreased the affinity of Tmod1 to stTM, making it similar to that of affinity of Tmod3 and Tmod4 to stTM. Significant reduction of inhibition of actin pointed-end polymerization in the presence of stTM was shown for Tmod1 (R11K/D12N/Q144K) as compared with WT Tmod1. When GFP-Tmod1 and mutants were expressed in primary chicken skeletal myocytes, decreased assembly of Tmod1 mutants was revealed. This indicates a direct correlation between TM-binding and the actin-capping abilities of Tmod. Our data confirmed the hypothesis that assembly of Tmod at the pointed-end of the actin filament depends on its TM-binding affinity.",Actin;Circular Dichroism (CD);Fluorescence;Site-directed Mutagenesis;Tropomyosin;Actin-capping;Intrinsically Disordered Regions;Protein-Protein Interactions;Tropomodulin

Although some subunits are present only in an ∼320-kDa complex-dependent form, other subunits are also detected in configurations distinct from the 8-subunit holocomplex. To date, the only known biochemical activity intrinsic to the complex, deneddylation of the Cullin subunits from Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases, is assigned to CSN5. As an essential step to understanding the structure and assembly of a CSN5-containing subcomplex of the CSN, we reconstituted a CSN4-5-6-7 subcomplex. The core of the subcomplex is based on a stable heterotrimeric association of CSN7, CSN4, and CSN6, requiring coexpression in a bacterial reconstitution system. To this heterotrimer, we could then add CSN5 in vitro to reconstitute a quaternary complex. Using biochemical and biophysical methods, we identified pairwise and combinatorial interactions necessary for the formation of the CSN4-5-6-7 subcomplex. The subcomplex is stabilized by three types of interactions: MPN-MPN between CSN5 and CSN6, PCI-PCI between CSN4 and CSN7, and interactions mediated through the CSN6 C terminus with CSN4 and CSN7.

Cholesterol is tightly regulated between the major brain cells and is essential for normal brain development. The metabolism of brain cholesterol differs markedly from that of other tissues. Brain cholesterol is primarily derived by de novo synthesis and the blood brain barrier prevents the uptake of lipoprotein cholesterol from the circulation. Defects in cholesterol metabolism lead to structural and functional central nervous system diseases such as Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, Niemann-Pick type C disease, and Alzheimer's disease. These diseases affect different metabolic pathways (cholesterol biosynthesis, lipid transport and lipoprotein assembly, apolipoproteins, lipoprotein receptors, and signaling molecules). We review the metabolic pathways of cholesterol in the CNS and its cell-specific and microdomain-specific interaction with other pathways such as the amyloid precursor protein and discuss potential treatment strategies as well as the effects of the widespread use of LDL cholesterol-lowering drugs on brain functions.",

The analysis reveals that hydration water suppresses protein motions at lower temperatures (<∼200 K), and facilitates protein dynamics at high temperatures. Experimental data demonstrate that the hydration water is harmonic at temperatures <∼180–190 K and is not affected by the proteins’ methyl group rotations. The dynamics of the hydration water exhibits changes at ∼180–190 K that we ascribe to the glass transition in the hydrated protein. Our results confirm significant differences in the dynamics of protein and its hydration water at high temperatures: on the picosecond-to-nanosecond timescale, the hydration water exhibits diffusive dynamics, while the protein motions are localized to <∼3 Å. The diffusion of the GFP hydration water is similar to the behavior of hydration water previously observed for other proteins. Comparison with other globular proteins (e.g., lysozyme) reveals that on the timescale of 1 ns and at equivalent hydration level, GFP dynamics (mean-square displacements and quasielastic intensity) are of much smaller amplitude. Moreover, the suppression of the protein dynamics by the hydration water at low temperatures appears to be stronger in GFP than in other globular proteins.

Consistent with this hypothesis, two Ser to Asp mutations in the 17 amino acid N-terminal httNT segment abrogate both visible brain aggregates and disease symptoms in a full length Q97 htt mouse model while compromising aggregation kinetics and aggregate morphology in a htt fragment in vitro (Gu et al., Neuron 64, 828–840 (2009)). The httNT segment has been shown to play a critical role in facilitating nucleation of amyloid formation in htt N-terminal exon1 fragments. We show here how these Ser to Asp mutations dramatically affect aggregation kinetics and aggregate structural integrity. First, these negatively charged Ser replacements impair the assembly of the α-helical oligomers that play a critical role in htt amyloid nucleation, thus providing an explanation for reduced amyloid formation rates. Second, these sequence modifications alter aggregate morphology, decrease aggregate stability, and enhance the steric accessibility of the httNT segment within the aggregates. Together these changes make the sequence-modified peptides kinetically and thermodynamically less likely to aggregate and more susceptible, if they do, to post-translational modifications and degradation. These effects also show how phosphorylation of a protein might achieve cellular effects via direct impacts on the protein’s aggregation properties. In fact, preliminary studies on exon1-like molecules containing phosphoryl-Ser residues at positions 13 and 16 show they reduce aggregation rates and generate atypical aggregate morphologies similar to the effects of the Ser to Asp mutants.",α-helical oligomers;nucleation;critical concentration;post-translational modification;phosphomimetic

Many of the unusual properties of Tau can be explained by its nature as a natively unfolded protein. Examples are the large number of structural conformations and biochemical modifications (phosphorylation, proteolysis, glycosylation, and others), the multitude of interaction partners (mainly microtubules, but also other cytoskeletal proteins, kinases, and phosphatases, motor proteins, chaperones, and membrane proteins). The pathological aggregation of Tau is counterintuitive, given its high solubility, but can be rationalized by short hydrophobic motifs forming β structures. The aggregation of Tau is toxic in cell and animal models, but can be reversed by suppressing expression or by aggregation inhibitors.

Further aspects of Tau as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target, its involvement in other Tau-based diseases, and its histopathology are covered by other chapters in this volume.",

However, the downstream mechanisms by which DR increases lifespan remain unclear. We used a gel based proteomic strategy to identify proteins whose expression was induced by DR in yeast and thus may correlate with longevity. One protein up-regulated by DR was Hsp12, a small heat shock protein induced by various manipulations known to retard ageing. Lifespan extension by growth on 0.5% glucose (DR) was abolished in an hsp12Δ strain, indicating that Hsp12 is essential for the longevity effect of DR. In contrast, deletion of HSP12 had no effect on growth under DR conditions or a variety of environmental stresses, indicating that the effect of Hsp12 on lifespan is not due to increased general stress resistance. Unlike other small heat shock proteins, recombinant Hsp12 displayed negligible in vitro molecular chaperone activity, suggesting that its cellular function does not involve preventing protein aggregation. NMR analysis indicated that Hsp12 is monomeric and intrinsically unfolded in solution, but switches to a 4-helical conformation upon binding to membrane-mimetic SDS micelles. The structure of micelle-bound Hsp12 reported here is consistent with its recently proposed function as a membrane-stabilising ‘lipid chaperone’. Taken together, our data suggest that DR-induced Hsp12 expression contributes to lifespan extension, possibly via membrane alterations.",

Repeat length differences among Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryotes were calculated in order to identify the conservation of the repeats in these divergent kingdoms. From the results, it was evident that these repeats have a higher degree of conservation in Bacteria and Archaea than in Eukaryotes. In addition, there seems to be a direct correlation between the repeat length difference and the degree of divergence between the species.

Available data for subsets of mRNAs that are translationally up- and down-regulated in yeast eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP) deletion mutants are coupled with reported mRNA secondary structure measurements to investigate whether 5′-UTR secondary structure varies between the subsets. Genes with up-regulated translational efficiencies in the caf20Δ mutant have relatively high averaged 5′-UTR secondary structure. There is no apparent wide-scale correlation of RNA-binding protein preferences with the increased 5′-UTR secondary structure, leading us to speculate that the secondary structure itself may play a role in differential partitioning of mRNAs between eIF4E/4E-BP repression and eIF4E/eIF4G translation initiation. Both Caf20p and Eap1p contain stretches of positive charge in regions of predicted disorder. Such regions are also present in eIF4G and have been reported to associate with mRNA binding. The pattern of these segments, around the canonical eIF4E-binding motif, varies between each 4E-BP and eIF4G. Analysis of gene ontology shows that yeast proteins containing predicted disordered segments, with positive charge runs, are enriched for nucleic acid binding.

However, few significant densities (greater than a factor of two above noise level) were actually visible near the point contacts, with some notable exceptions (e.g. red arrow in Figure 5A). This lack of ubiquitous protein densities could be attributed to the low number of synaptic proteins that are expected to be involved in docking and exocytosis (van den Bogaart and Jahn, 2011); proteins could also be overlapping with the interface in projection and be masked by the high-contrast lipids. To support the notion that the few observed instances of significant densities could be related to synaptic proteins, we overlaid two alternative models of the synaptotagmin 1 • SNARE complex to the image of a point contact with the highest contrast, assuming that the marked density is related to the globular synaptotagmin C2 domains (Figure 5B,C). The apparent lack of density for the SNARE complex agrees with the notion of a partially folded trans-SNARE complex that is stabilized by repulsive forces between solvated membranes (Gao et al., 2012), as approximately indicated in our models. The single molecule FRET efficiency data of the synaptotagmin 1 • SNARE complex indicated multiple binding modes (Choi et al., 2010), with the top solution shown in Figure 5B. An alterative model of this complex (Figure 5C) was based on NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments of the complex between synaptotagmin 1 and the SNARE complex (Dai et al., 2007). Both models predict that it is the C2B domain that interacts with the SNARE complex, although the exact interface and orientation between the molecules is different. While approximate, these conceptual models may serve as guide to speculate about the involvement of synaptic proteins in forming the point contact, and setting the stage for Ca2+-triggered fusion. For example, the position of synaptotagmin 1 in our models would enable Ca2+-triggered membrane juxtaposition (Araç et al., 2006) and membrane bending (Hui et al., 2009; McMahon et al., 2010). Membrane bending or buckling could in turn destabilize the membrane, and in conjunction with full zippering of the SNARE complex, lead to fusion pore opening.",Other

While amyloid fibril deposition in the extracellular space certainly disrupts cellular and tissue architecture late in the course of amyloid diseases, strong genetic, pathological and pharmacologic evidence suggests that the process of amyloid fibril formation itself, known as amyloidogenesis, likely causes these maladies. It seems that the formation of oligomeric aggregates during the amyloidogenesis process causes the proteotoxicity and cytotoxicity characteristic of these disorders. Herein, we review what is known about the genetics, biochemistry and pathology of familial amyloidosis of Finnish Type (FAF) or gelsolin amyloidosis. Briefly, autosomal dominant D187N or D187Y mutations compromise Ca2+ binding in domain 2 of gelsolin, allowing domain 2 to sample unfolded conformations. When domain 2 is unfolded, gelsolin is subject to aberrant furin endoproteolysis as it passes through the Golgi on its way to the extracellular space. The resulting C-terminal 68kDa fragment (C68) is susceptible to extracellular endoproteolytic events, possibly mediated by a matrix metalloprotease, affording 8 and 5 kDa amyloidogenic fragments of gelsolin. These amyloidogenic fragments deposit systemically, causing a variety of symptoms, including corneal lattice dystrophy and neurodegeneration. The first murine model of the disease recapitulates the aberrant processing of mutant plasma gelsolin, amyloid deposition, and the degenerative phenotype. We use what we have learned from our biochemical studies, as well as insight from mouse and human pathology to propose therapeutic strategies that may halt the progression of FAF.",Familial amyloidosis of Finnish type;calcium binding;amyloidogenesis;aberrant proteolysis;furin;gelsolin amyloid disease

Here we elucidated the role of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein-U (hnRNP-U), identified in the immunoprecipitate of human NEIL1, a major DNA glycosylase responsible for oxidized base repair. hnRNP-U directly interacts with NEIL1 in vitro via the NEIL1 common interacting C-terminal domain, which is dispensable for its enzymatic activity. Their in-cell association increases after oxidative stress. hnRNP-U stimulates the NEIL1 in vitro base excision activity for 5-hydroxyuracil in duplex, bubble, forked, or single-stranded DNA substrate, primarily by enhancing product release. Using eluates from FLAG-NEIL1 immunoprecipitates from human cells, we observed 3-fold enhancement in complete repair activity after oxidant treatment. The lack of such enhancement in hnRNP-U-depleted cells suggests its involvement in repairing enhanced base damage after oxidative stress. The NEIL1 disordered C-terminal region binds to hnRNP-U at equimolar ratio with high affinity (Kd = ∼54 nm). The interacting regions in hnRNP-U, mapped to both termini, suggest their proximity in the native protein; these are also disordered, based on PONDR (Predictor of Naturally Disordered Regions) prediction and circular dichroism spectra. Finally, depletion of hnRNP-U and NEIL1 epistatically sensitized human cells at low oxidative genome damage, suggesting that the hnRNP-U protection of cells after oxidative stress is largely due to enhancement of NEIL1-mediated repair.",Base Excision Repair;DNA Damage Response;DNA Enzymes;DNA Repair;Fluorescence;NEIL1;Noncanonical Proteins in Base Excision Repair;Oxidized Genome Damage;RNA-binding Proteins;hnRNP-U

One product of systems biology has been the delineation of graph models for describing genome-wide protein-protein interaction networks. The network organization and topology which emerges in such models may be used to address fundamental questions in an array of cellular processes, as well as biological features intrinsic to the constituent proteins (or “nodes”) themselves. However, graph models alone constitute an abstraction which neglects the underlying biological and physical reality that the network’s nodes and edges are highly heterogeneous entities. Here, we explore some of the advantages of introducing a protein structural dimension to such models, as the marriage of conventional network representations with macromolecular structural data helps to place static node-and-edge constructs in a biologically more meaningful context. We emphasize that 3D protein structures constitute a valuable conceptual and predictive framework by discussing examples of the insights provided, such as enabling in silico predictions of protein-protein interactions, providing rational and compelling classification schemes for network elements, as well as revealing interesting intrinsic differences between distinct node types, such as disorder and evolutionary features, which may then be rationalized in light of their respective functions within networks.",

These bacterial EPIYA effectors are delivered into host cells via type III or IV secretion, where they undergo tyrosine phosphorylation at the EPIYA motif and thereby manipulate host signalling by promiscuously interacting with multiple SH2 domain-containing proteins. Up to now, nine EPIYA effectors have been identified from various bacteria. These effectors do not share sequence homology outside the EPIYA motif, arguing against the idea that they have common ancestors. A search of mammalian proteomes revealed the presence of a mammalian EPIYA-containing protein, Pragmin, which potentiates Src family kinase (SFK) activity by binding and sequestrating the SFK inhibitor Csk upon EPIYA phosphorylation. As several bacterial EPIYA effectors also target Csk, they may have evolved through generation of sequences that mimic the Pragmin EPIYA motif. EPIYA motifs are often diverged through multiple duplications in each bacterial effector. Such a structural plasticity appears to be due to intrinsic disorder of the EPIYA-containing region, which enables the bacterial effectors to undergo efficient phosphorylation and mediate promiscuous interaction with multiple host proteins. Given the functional versatility of the EPIYA motif, many more bacterial EPIYA effectors will soon be emerging.",

These are denoted N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain and are joined by a charged linker region rich in serine and arginine residues (SR linker). In mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), the NTD binds the transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS) RNA, a conserved hexanucleotide sequence required for subgenomic RNA synthesis. The NTD is also capable of disrupting a short RNA duplex. We show here that three residues on the β3 (Arg-125 and Tyr-127) and β5 (Tyr-190) strands play key roles in TRS RNA binding and helix destabilization with Ala substitutions of these residues lethal to the virus. NMR studies of the MHV NTD·TRS complex revealed that this region defines a major RNA binding interface in MHV with site-directed spin labeling studies consistent with a model in which the adenosine-rich 3′-region of TRS is anchored by Arg-125, Tyr-127, and Tyr-190 in a way that is critical for efficient subgenomic RNA synthesis in MHV. Characterization of CoV N NTDs from infectious bronchitis virus and from severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV revealed that, although detailed NTD-TRS determinants are distinct from those of MHV NTD, rapid helix destabilization activity of CoV N NTDs is most strongly correlated with CoV function and virus viability.",Nuclear Magnetic Resonance;Protein/Nucleic Acid Interaction;RNA-binding Protein;Viral Protein;Viral Transcription;Coronavirus;RNA Chaperone;Mouse Hepatitis Virus

Characterisation of this species is often difficult since the native state is usually predominantly populated at equilibrium. Previous work has shown that the four-helix protein, Im7 (immunity protein 7), folds via an on-pathway intermediate. While the transition states and folding intermediate have been characterised in atomistic detail, knowledge of the unfolded ensemble under the same ambient conditions remained sparse. Here, we introduce destabilising amino acid substitutions into the sequence of Im7, such that the unfolded state becomes predominantly populated at equilibrium in the absence of denaturant. Using far- and near-UV CD, fluorescence, urea titration and heteronuclear NMR experiments, we show that three amino acid substitutions (L18A–L19A–L37A) are sufficient to prevent Im7 folding, such that the unfolded state is predominantly populated at equilibrium. Using measurement of chemical shifts, 15N transverse relaxation rates and sedimentation coefficients, we show that the unfolded species of L18A–L19A–L37A deviates significantly from random-coil behaviour. Specifically, we demonstrate that this unfolded species is compact (Rh = 25 Å) relative to the urea-denatured state (Rh ≥ 30 Å) and contains local clusters of hydrophobic residues in regions that correspond to the four helices in the native state. Despite these interactions, there is no evidence for long-range stabilising tertiary interactions or persistent helical structure.

To remove poorly sequenced and/or incorrectly identified orthologues, aligned domains with indels covering >10% of the reference domain sequence were removed.

Both problems can be addressed by amino-acid specific isotope labeling in conjunction with 15N–1H correlation experiments. In this work an extended combinatorial selective in vitro labeling scheme is proposed that seeks to reduce the number of samples required for assignment. Including three different species of amino acids in each sample, 15N, 1- 13C, and fully 13C/15 N labeled, permits identification of more amino acid types and sequential pairs than would be possible with previously published combinatorial methods. The new protocol involves recording of up to five 2D triple-resonance experiments to distinguish the various isotopomeric dipeptide species. The pattern of backbone NH cross peaks in this series of spectra adds a new dimension to the combinatorial grid, which otherwise mostly relies on comparison of [15N, 1H]–HSQC and possibly 2D HN(CO) spectra of samples with different labeled amino acid compositions. Application to two α-helical membrane proteins shows that using no more than three samples information can be accumulated such that backbone assignments can be completed solely based on 3D HNCA/ HN(CO)CA experiments. Alternatively, in the case of severe signal overlap in certain regions of the standard suite of triple-resonance spectra acquired on uniformly labeled protein, or missing signals due to a lack of efficiency of 3D experiments, the remaining gaps can be filled.",BEST-TROSY;Cell-free expression;Isotope labeling;Proteorhodopsin;Triple-resonance NMR;Voltage-sensor domain

Catalytic properties of these enzymes were previously established mostly using low molecular weight MetO-containing compounds, whereas little is known about the catalysis of MetO reduction in proteins, the physiological substrates of MSRA and MSRB. In this work we exploited an NADPH-dependent thioredoxin system and determined the kinetic parameters of yeast MSRA and MSRB using three different MetO-containing proteins. Both enzymes showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with the Km lower for protein than for small MetO-containing substrates. MSRA reduced both oxidized proteins and low molecular weight MetO-containing compounds with similar catalytic efficiencies, whereas MSRB was specialized for the reduction of MetO in proteins. Using oxidized glutathione S-transferase as a model substrate, we showed that both MSR types were more efficient in reducing MetO in unfolded than in folded proteins and that their activities increased with the unfolding state. Biochemical quantification and identification of MetO reduced in the substrates by mass spectrometry revealed that the increased activity was due to better access to oxidized MetO in unfolded proteins; it also showed that MSRA was intrinsically more active with unfolded proteins regardless of MetO availability. Moreover, MSRs most efficiently protected cells from oxidative stress that was accompanied by protein unfolding. Overall, this study indicates that MSRs serve a critical function in the folding process by repairing oxidatively damaged nascent polypeptides and unfolded proteins.",Enzyme Catalysis;Oxidative Stress;Protein Folding;Stress;Yeast;Methionine Sulfoxide;Methionine Sulfoxide Reductase;Protein Unfolding;Oxidation

Expansion of the polyglutamine (polyQ) domain facilitates aggregation of the affected protein, and several studies directly link aggregation to neurotoxicity. Studies of synthetic polyQ peptides have contributed substantially to our understanding of the mechanism of aggregation. In this report, polyQ fibrils were immobilized onto a sensor, and their elongation by polyQ peptides of various length and conformation was examined using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). The rate of elongation increased as the peptide length increased from 8 to 24 glutamines (Q8, Q20, and Q24). Monomer conformation affected elongation rates: insertion of a β-turn template d-Pro-Gly in the center of the peptide increased elongation rates several-fold, while insertion of Pro-Pro dramatically slowed elongation. Dissipation measurements of the QCM-D provided qualitative information about mechanical properties of the elongating fibrils. These data showed clear differences in the characteristics of the elongating aggregates, depending on the specific identity of the associating polyQ peptide. Elongation rates were sensitive to the pH and ionic strength of the buffer. Comparison of QCM-D data with those obtained by optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy revealed that very little water was associated with the elongation of fibrils by the peptide containing d-Pro-Gly, but a significant amount of water was associated when the fibrils were elongated by Q20. Together, the data indicate that elongation of polyQ fibrils can occur without full consolidation to the fibril structure, resulting in variations to the aggregate structure during elongation.",aggregation;fibril elongation;polyglutamine;quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D);optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS)

D-loop of tRNA in Bacteria, Eukaryota, and some Archaea. Despite the
abundant occurrence of D, little is known about its biochemical roles in
mediating tRNA function. It is assumed that D may destabilize the structure
of tRNA and thus enhance its conformational flexibility. D is generated
post-transcriptionally by the reduction of the 5,6-double bond of a uridine
residue in RNA transcripts. The reaction is carried out by dihydrouridine
synthases (DUS). DUS constitute a conserved family of enzymes encoded by the
orthologous gene family COG0042. In protein sequence databases, members of
COG0042 are typically annotated as “predicted TIM-barrel enzymes,
possibly dehydrogenases, nifR3 family”.",Dihydrouridine synthases;Protein structure prediction;Fold recognition;Remote homology;RNA modification;Molecular evolution;Enzymes acting on RNA

Certain glutamine/asparagine (Q/N)-rich proteins in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae assemble into self-replicating amyloid-like protein polymers, or prions, that act as genetic elements in an entirely protein-based system of inheritance. The nuclear pore complex (NPC) contains multiple Q/N-rich proteins whose self-assembly has also been proposed to underlie structural and functional properties of the NPC. Here we show that an essential sequence feature of these proteins—repeating GLFG motifs—strongly promotes their self-assembly into amyloids with characteristics of prions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Nup100 can form bona fide prions, thus establishing a previously undiscovered ability of yeast GLFG nucleoporins to adopt this conformational state in vivo.",nucleoporin;nuclear pore complex;yeast prion;GLFG nup;amyloid

Here, we employ extensive molecular dynamics simulations with atomistic protein and water models to determine structural ensembles for Aβ42, Aβ40, and Aβ42-E22K (the Italian mutant) monomers in solution. Sampling of a total of >700 microseconds in all-atom detail with explicit solvent enables us to observe the effects of peptide length and a pathogenic mutation on the disordered Aβ monomer structural ensemble. Aβ42 and Aβ40 have crudely similar characteristics but reducing the peptide length from 42 to 40 residues reduces β-hairpin formation near the C-terminus. The pathogenic Italian E22K mutation induces helix formation in the region of residues 20–24. This structural alteration may increase helix-helix interactions between monomers, resulting in altered mechanism and kinetics of Aβ oligomerization.",

The N-terminal domain of Kv1 proteins binds to β-subunits, but the role of the C-terminus is less clear. Therefore, we studied the role of the C-terminus in regulating Kv1.5 channel and its interactions with Kvβ-subunits. When expressed in COS-7 cells, deletion of the C-terminal domain of Kv1.5 did not affect channel gating or kinetics. Co-expression of Kv1.5 with Kvβ3 increased current inactivation, whereas Kvβ2 caused a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage-dependence of current activation. Inclusion of NADPH in the patch pipette solution accelerated the inactivation of Kv1.5-Kvβ3 currents. In contrast, NADP+ decreased the rate and the extent of Kvβ3-induced inactivation and reversed the hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage-dependence of activation induced by Kvβ2. Currents generated by Kv1.5ΔC+Kvβ3 or Kv1.5ΔC+Kvβ2 complexes did not respond to changes in intracellular pyridine nucleotide concentration, indicating that the C-terminus is required for pyridine nucleotide-dependent interactions between Kvβ and Kv1.5. A glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the C-terminal peptide of Kv1.5 did not bind to apoKvβ2, but displayed higher affinity for Kvβ2:NADPH than Kvβ2:NADP+. The GST fusion protein also precipitated Kvβ proteins from mouse brain lysates. Pull-down experiments, structural analysis and electrophysiological data indicated that a specific region of the C-terminus (Arg543-Val583) is required for Kvβ binding. These results suggest that the C-terminal domain of Kv1.5 interacts with β-subunits and that this interaction is essential for the differential regulation of Kv currents by oxidized and reduced nucleotides.",Voltage-gated potassium channel;whole-cell patch clamp;Kvβ;pyridine nucleotides;redox;aldo-keto reductase

In addition to a DNA-binding ETS domain, Pointed-P2 contains a PNT (or SAM) domain that serves as a docking module to enhance phosphorylation of an adjacent phosphoacceptor threonine by the ERK2 MAP kinase Rolled. Using NMR chemical shift, 15N relaxation, and amide hydrogen exchange measurements, we demonstrate that the Pointed-P2 PNT domain contains a dynamic N-terminal helix H0 appended to a core conserved five-helix bundle diagnostic of the SAM domain fold. Neither the secondary structure nor dynamics of the PNT domain is perturbed significantly upon in vitro ERK2 phosphorylation of three threonine residues in a disordered sequence immediately preceding this domain. These data thus confirm that the Drosophila Pointed-P2 PNT domain and phosphoacceptors are highly similar to those of the well-characterized human ETS1 transcription factor. NMR-monitored titrations also revealed that the phosphoacceptors and helix H0, as well as region of the core helical bundle identified previously by mutational analyses as a kinase docking site, are selectively perturbed upon ERK2 binding by Pointed-P2. Based on a homology model derived from the ETS1 PNT domain, helix H0 is predicted to partially occlude the docking interface. Therefore, this dynamic helix must be displaced to allow both docking of the kinase, as well as binding of Mae, a Drosophila protein that negatively regulates Pointed-P2 by competing with the kinase for its docking site.",transcription;Ras-dependent signal transduction;PNT domain;SAM domain;MAP kinase docking;phosphorylation;protein dynamics;hydrogen exchange;NMR spectroscopy

The tail region has dual functions as a regulator of membrane binding/enzyme activation and as an inhibitor of catalysis in the unbound form of the enzyme, suggesting conformational plasticity. These functions are well conserved in CCTs across diverse phyla, although the sequences of the tail regions are not. CCT regulatory tails of diverse origins are composed of a long membrane lipid-inducible amphipathic helix (m-AH) followed by a highly disordered segment, reminiscent of the Parkinson disease-linked protein, α-synuclein, which we show shares a novel sequence motif with vertebrate CCTs. To unravel features required for silencing, we created chimeric enzymes by fusing the catalytic domain of rat CCTα to the regulatory tail of CCTs from Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae or to α-synuclein. Only the tail domains of the two invertebrate CCTs were competent for both suppression of catalytic activity and for activation by lipid vesicles. Thus, both silencing and activating functions of the m-AH can tolerate significant changes in length and sequence. We identified a highly amphipathic 22-residue segment in the m-AH with features conserved among animal CCTs but not yeast CCT or α-synuclein. Deletion of this segment from rat CCT increased the lipid-independent Vmax by 10-fold, equivalent to the effect of deleting the entire tail, and severely weakened membrane binding affinity. However, membrane binding was required for additional increases in catalytic efficiency. Thus, full activation of CCT may require not only loss of a silencing conformation in the m-AH but a gain of an activating conformation, promoted by membrane binding.",α-Synuclein;Enzyme Inactivation;Intrinsically Disordered Proteins;Phosphatidylcholine;Protein Chimeras;Amphipathic α Helix;Auto-inhibition;Lipid Vesicle

In its basic form, it consists of a regulatory ATPase complex and a proteolytic core particle. The interaction between the two is governed by an HbYX motif (where Hb is a hydrophobic residue, Y is tyrosine, and X is any amino acid) at the C terminus of the ATPase subunits, which stimulates gate opening of the proteasomal α-subunits. In archaea, the proteasome-interacting motif is not only found in canonical proteasome-activating nucleotidases of the PAN/ARC/Rpt group, which are absent in major archaeal lineages, but also in proteins of the CDC48/p97/VAT and AMA groups, suggesting a regulatory network of proteasomal ATPases. Indeed, Thermoplasma acidophilum, which lacks PAN, encodes one CDC48 protein that interacts with the 20S proteasome and activates the degradation of model substrates. In contrast, Methanosarcina mazei contains seven AAA proteins, five of which, both PAN proteins, two out of three CDC48 proteins, and the AMA protein, function as proteasomal gatekeepers.

We recently characterized NEIL1’s specific binding to downstream canonical repair and non-canonical accessory proteins, all of which involve NEIL1’s disordered C-terminal segment as the common interaction domain (CID). This domain is dispensable for NEIL1’s base excision and abasic (AP) lyase activities, but is required for its interactions with other repair proteins. Here, we show that truncated NEIL1 lacking the CID is markedly deficient in initiating in vitro repair of 5-hydroxyuracil (an oxidative deamination product of C) in a plasmid substrate compared to the wild-type NEIL1, thus suggesting a critical role of CID in the coordination of overall repair. Furthermore, while NEIL1 downregulation significantly sensitized human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells to reactive oxygen species (ROS), ectopic wild-type NEIL1, but not the truncated mutant, restored resistance to ROS. These results demonstrate that cell survival and NEIL1-dependent repair of oxidative DNA base damage require interactions among repair proteins, which could be explored as a cancer therapeutic target in order to increase the efficiency of chemo/radiation treatment.",NEIL1;DNA glycosylase;base excision repair;protein-protein interaction;reactive oxygen species;common interaction domain;disordered structure;oxidative base damage and repair

In Vibrio cholerae, Hfq and four Hfq-dependent small RNAs are essential for the expression of virulence genes, but little is known about this mechanism at the molecular level. To better understand V. cholerae Hfq structure and mechanism, we characterized the protein, alongside Escherichia coli Hfq for comparison, using biochemical and biophysical techniques. The N-terminal domain (NTD) of the two proteins is highly conserved, but the C-terminal regions (CTRs) vary in both sequence and length. Small-angle X-ray scattering studies showed that both proteins adopt a star-shaped hexameric structure in which the conserved NTD adopts the expected Sm fold while the variable CTR is disordered and extends radially outwards from the folded core. Despite their structural similarity, SDS-PAGE stability assays and collision-induced dissociation mass spectrometry revealed that the V. cholerae hexamer is less stable than that of E. coli. We propose that this is due to minor differences between the intersubunit interface formed by the NTDs and the ability of the E. coli CTR to stabilize this interface. However, based on electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the divergent CTRs do appear to perform a common function with regard to RNA-binding specificity.

However, the structure of the full length acetylated Tat bound to PCAF has not been yet determined experimentally. Acetylation of Tat residues can play a critical role in enhancing HIV-1 transcriptional activation. Here, we have combined a fully flexible protein-protein docking approach with molecular dynamics simulations to predict the structural determinants of the complex for the common HIV-1BRU variant. This model reproduces all the crucial contacts between the Tat peptide 46SYGR(AcK)KRRQRC56 and the PCAF bromodomain previously reported by NMR spectroscopy. Additionally, inclusion of the entire Tat protein results in additional contact points at the protein-protein interface. The model is consistent with the available experimental data reported and adds novel information to our previous structural predictions of the PCAF bromodomain in complex with the rare HIVZ2 variant, which was obtained with a less accurate computational method. This improved characterization of Tat.PCAF bromodomain binding may help in defining the structural determinants of other protein interactions involving lysine acetylation.",Tat;PCAF BRD;HIV-1;docking;protein-protein interaction

How these remarkable changes come about is not well understood. Using a phenotypic reporter for a synthetic yeast prion, we identified two protein-sorting factors of the Hook family, termed Btn2 and Cur1, as key regulators of spatial protein quality control in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Btn2 and Cur1 are undetectable under normal growth conditions but accumulate in stressed cells due to increased gene expression and reduced proteasomal turnover. Newly synthesized Btn2 can associate with the small heat shock protein Hsp42 to promote the sorting of misfolded proteins to a peripheral protein deposition site. Alternatively, Btn2 can bind to the chaperone Sis1 to facilitate the targeting of misfolded proteins to a juxtanuclear compartment. Protein redistribution by Btn2 is accompanied by a gradual depletion of Sis1 from the cytosol, which is mediated by the sorting factor Cur1. On the basis of these findings, we propose a dynamic model that explains the subcellular distribution of misfolded proteins as a function of the cytosolic concentrations of molecular chaperones and protein-sorting factors. Our model suggests that protein aggregation is not a haphazard process but rather an orchestrated cellular response that adjusts the flux of misfolded proteins to the capacities of the protein quality control system.",

Although these proteins have been extensively investigated, still relatively little is known about their folding mechanism. Here, using single-molecule force spectroscopy and steered molecule dynamics simulation, we study the unfolding of HP35 under external force. Our results show that HP35 unfolds at extremely low forces without a well-defined unfolding transition state. Subsequently, we probe the structure of unfolded HP35 using the persistence length obtained in the force spectroscopy. We found that the persistence length of unfolded HP35 is around 0.72 nm, >40% longer than typical unstructured proteins, suggesting that there are a significant amount of residual secondary structures in the unfolded HP35. Molecular dynamics simulation further confirmed this finding and revealed that many native contacts are preserved in HP35, even its two ends have been extended up to 8 nm. Our results therefore suggest that retaining a significant amount of secondary structures in the unfolded state of HP35 may be an efficient way to reduce the entropic cost for the formation of tertiary structure and increase the folding speed, although the folding cooperativity is compromised. Moreover, we anticipate that the methods we used in this work can be extended to the study of other proteins with complex folding behaviors and even intrinsically disordered ones.",

We describe here how pure and functionally active pig gastric H+,K+-ATPase with an apparent Stokes radius of 6.3 nm can be obtained after solubilization with the non-ionic detergent C12E8, followed by exchange of C12E8 with Tween 20 on a Superose 6 column. Mass spectroscopy indicates that the β-subunit bears an excess mass of 9 kDa attributable to glycosylation. From chemical analysis, there are 0.25 g of phospholipids and around 0.024 g of cholesterol bound per g of protein. Analytical ultracentrifugation shows one main complex, sedimenting at s20,w = 7.2 ± 0.1 S, together with minor amounts of irreversibly aggregated material. From these data, a buoyant molecular mass is calculated, corresponding to an H+,K+-ATPase α,β-protomer of 147.3 kDa. Complementary sedimentation velocity with deuterated water gives a picture of an α,β-protomer with 0.9–1.4 g/g of bound detergent and lipids and a reasonable frictional ratio of 1.5, corresponding to a Stokes radius of 7.1 nm. An α2,β2 dimer is rejected by the data. Light scattering coupled to gel filtration confirms the monomeric state of solubilized H+,K+-ATPase. Thus, α,β H+,K+-ATPase is active at least in detergent and may plausibly function as a monomer, as has been established for other P-type ATPases, Ca2+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase.",Analytical Ultracentrifugation;ATPases;Biophysics;Membrane Enzymes;Transporters;Activity;Association State;Detergent;Purification;Solubilization

More recently, reduced sleep duration has gained significant attention for its possible contribution to metabolic dysfunction. Significant evidence suggests that reduced sleep duration may elevate the risk for impaired glucose functioning, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. However, to date, few studies have determined the implications of reduced sleep duration with regard to glucose control during pregnancy. With the high prevalence of overweight and obesity in women of reproductive age, the occurrence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing. GDM results in elevated risk of maternal and fetal complications, as well as increased risk of type 2 diabetes postpartum. Infants born to women with GDM also carry a life-long risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The impact of reduced sleep on glucose management during pregnancy has not yet been fully assessed and a paucity of literature currently exits. Herein, we review the association between reduced sleep and impaired carbohydrate metabolism and propose how reduced sleep during pregnancy may result in further dysfunction of the carbohydrate axis. A particular focus will be given to sleep-disordered breathing, as well as GDM-complicated pregnancies. Putative mechanisms of action by which reduced sleep may adversely affect maternal and infant outcomes are also discussed. Finally, we will outline important research questions that need to be addressed.",sleep;sleep-disordered breathing;pregnancy;gestational diabetes

This MBP splice isoform also has a plethora of post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, deimination, methylation, and deamidation, that reduce its overall net charge and alter its protein and lipid associations within oligodendrocytes (OLGs). It was originally thought that MBP was simply a structural component of myelin; however, additional investigations have demonstrated that MBP is multi-functional, having numerous protein-protein interactions with Ca2+-calmodulin, actin, tubulin, and proteins with SH3-domains, and it can tether these proteins to a lipid membrane in vitro. Here, we have examined cytoskeletal interactions of classic 18.5-kDa MBP, in vivo, using early developmental N19-OLGs transfected with fluorescently-tagged MBP, actin, tubulin, and zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1). We show that MBP redistributes to distinct ‘membrane-ruffled’ regions of the plasma membrane where it co-localizes with actin and tubulin, and with the SH3-domain-containing proteins cortactin and ZO-1, when stimulated with PMA, a potent activator of the protein kinase C pathway. Moreover, using phospho-specific antibody staining, we show an increase in phosphorylated Thr98 MBP (human sequence numbering) in membrane-ruffled OLGs. Previously, Thr98 phosphorylation of MBP has been shown to affect its conformation, interactions with other proteins, and tethering of other proteins to the membrane in vitro. Here, MBP and actin were also co-localized in new focal adhesion contacts induced by IGF-1 stimulation in cells grown on laminin-2. This study supports a role for classic MBP isoforms in cytoskeletal and other protein-protein interactions during membrane and cytoskeletal remodeling in OLGs.",Membrane ruffling;Focal adhesion contacts;Phorbol ester;IGF-1;Laminin-2;Cytoskeleton;Myelination;Live-cell imaging;TIRF microscopy;Confocal microscopy

One of the obstacles to measuring fast kinetics in single molecule fluorescence experiments is blinking of the fluorophores on a timescale that is not well separated from the process of interest. By incorporating acceptor blinking into a two-state kinetics model, we show that it is possible to extract accurate rate coefficients on the microsecond time scale for folding and unfolding using the maximum likelihood method of I.V.

The extracted parameters agree with both the decay rate of the donor-acceptor cross correlation function and the results of ensemble equilibrium and kinetic experiments using nanosecond laser temperature jump.",

The method is based on the idea that asymmetric monomers, formed by rigid domains of known atomic structure possibly connected by flexible linkers of known sequence, are assembled according to a point-group symmetry combined with a screw axis. Scattering amplitudes of domains and linkers are determined by means of a spherical harmonics expansion and combined to get the form factor of the assembly. To avoid any overlap among domains, the contact distance between two asymmetric domains is determined as a function of their orientation by a new algorithm, based on Stone’s Invariants expansion. To account for continuity and compactness of the whole assembly, an anisotropic Lennard-Jones potential among domains, written in terms of the contact distances, is included in the merit function. QUAFIT allows for the simultaneous presence of oligomerization intermediates as well as of monomers distributed over multiple conformations. QUAFIT has been tested by studying the structure of a high molecular weight protein, the hemocyanin from Octopus vulgaris, under solution conditions that stabilize the decameric form or induce dissociation into monomers, respectively. Results are in very good agreement with the structural model derived from electron microscopy observations.",

The binding and hydrolysis of ATP by Hsp90 drive conformational rearrangements in three structure domains. Two intrinsically disordered regions of Hsp90 located between these domains and at the C terminus have traditionally been considered to impart flexibility. We discovered that the charged nature of these acid-rich disordered regions imparts a solubility-promoting function to Hsp90 that is important for its cellular activity in yeast. Both the solubility-promoting function and ATPase activity must occur in the same Hsp90 molecule in order to support robust growth, suggesting that the solubility-promoting function is required during the ATP-driven client maturation process. Expression of model clients together with Hsp90 variants indicated interdependent solubilities mediated by the aggregation propensities of both the client and Hsp90. We propose a model whereby the charge-rich disordered regions of Hsp90 serve a solubility-promoting function important for complexes with aggregation-prone clients. These findings demonstrate a novel biological function of the intrinsically disordered regions in Hsp90 and provide a compelling rationale for why their charged properties are conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution.",

Co-expression of the cytoplasmic P. falciparum heat shock protein 110 (PfHsp110c) prevented aggregation. Human or yeast orthologs were much less effective. All-Asn and all-Gln versions of Sup35 were protected from aggregation by PfHsp110c, suggesting that this chaperone is not limited to handling runs of Asn. PfHsp110c gene knockout parasites were not viable and conditional knockdown parasites died slowly in the absence of protein-stabilizing ligand.

Although FIH-mediated hydroxylation of HIF-α is well characterized, ARDs were only recently identified as substrates, and less is known about their recognition and hydroxylation by FIH. We investigated the molecular determinants of FIH substrate recognition, with a focus on differences between HIF and ARD substrates. We show that for ARD proteins, structural context is an important determinant of FIH-recognition, but analyses of chimeric substrate proteins indicate that the ankyrin fold alone is not sufficient to explain the distinct substrate properties of the ARDs compared with HIF. For both substrates the kinetic parameters of hydroxylation are influenced by the amino acids proximal to the target asparagine. Although FIH tolerates a variety of chemically disparate residues proximal to the asparagine, we demonstrate that certain combinations of amino acids are not permissive to hydroxylation. Finally, we characterize a conserved RLL motif in HIF and demonstrate that it mediates a high affinity interaction with FIH in the presence of cell lysate or macromolecular crowding agents. Collectively, our data highlight the importance of residues proximal to the asparagine in determining hydroxylation, and identify additional substrate-specific elements that contribute to distinct properties of HIF and ARD proteins as substrates for FIH. These distinct features are likely to influence FIH substrate choice in vivo and, therefore, have important consequences for HIF regulation.",Gene Regulation;Hydroxylase;Hypoxia;Hypoxia-inducible Factor (HIF);Protein Chemical Modification;Ankyrin Repeats;Factor Inhibiting HIF (FIH)

An intriguing property of many SAMs is their ability to self-associate, forming an open-ended polymer structure whose formation has been shown to be essential for the function of the protein. What remains largely unresolved is how polymerization is controlled. Previously, we had determined that the stretch of unstructured residues N-terminal to the SAM of a Drosophila protein called Polyhomeotic (Ph), a member of the Polycomb Group (PcG) of gene silencers, plays a key role in controlling Ph SAM polymerization. Ph SAM with its native linker created shorter polymers compared to Ph SAM attached to either a random linker or no linker. Here, we show that the SAM linker for the human Ph ortholog, Polyhomeotic homolog 3 (PHC3), also controls PHC3 SAM polymerization but does so in the opposite fashion. PHC3 SAM with its native linker allows longer polymers to form compared to when attached to a random linker. Attaching the PHC3 SAM linker to Ph SAM also resulted in extending Ph SAM polymerization. Moreover, in the context of full-length Ph protein, replacing the SAM linker with PHC3 SAM linker, intended to create longer polymers, resulted in greater repressive ability for the chimera compared to wild-type Ph. These findings show that polymeric SAM linkers evolved to modulate a wide dynamic range of SAM polymerization abilities and suggest that rationally manipulating the function of SAM containing proteins through controlling their SAM polymerization may be possible.",

How, then, is it possible for organisms to ameliorate mutation-induced perturbations of protein stability while maintaining biological fitness and gaining a selective advantage? Here we used site-specific chromosomal mutagenesis to introduce a selected set of mostly destabilizing mutations into folA—an essential chromosomal gene of Escherichia coli encoding dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)—to determine how changes in protein stability, activity, and abundance affect fitness. In total, 27 E. coli strains carrying mutant DHFR were created. We found no significant correlation between protein stability and its catalytic activity nor between catalytic activity and fitness in a limited range of variation of catalytic activity observed in mutants. The stability of these mutants is strongly correlated with their intracellular abundance, suggesting that protein homeostatic machinery plays an active role in maintaining intracellular concentrations of proteins. Fitness also shows a significant correlation with intracellular abundance of soluble DHFR in cells growing at 30 °C. At 42 °C, the picture was mixed, yet remarkable: A few strains carrying mutant DHFR proteins aggregated, rendering them nonviable, but, intriguingly, the majority exhibited fitness higher than wild type. We found that mutational destabilization of DHFR proteins in E. coli is counterbalanced at 42 °C by their soluble oligomerization, thereby restoring structural stability and protecting against aggregation.",fitness landscape;genotype-phenotype relation;molecular evolution;protein solubility;protein aggregation

The stability of the His-heme loops becomes progressively greater for the pure polyGln sequences relative to the Gln-rich sequences as GdnHCl concentration decreases from 6.0 to 1.5 M. Thus, the context of the sequence effects the polymer properties of Gln repeats even in denaturing concentrations of GdnHCl. Comparison of data for the Gln-rich variants with previous results for Gly-rich and Ala-rich variants shows that ν3 ∼ 2.2 for the Gln-rich, Gly-rich, and Ala-rich sequences in 6.0 M GdnHCl, whereas ν3 remains unchanged at 3.0 M GdnHCl concentration for the Gln-rich and Ala-rich sequences but decreases to ∼1.7 for the Gly-rich sequences. Thus, the polymer properties of Gln-rich and Ala-rich sequences are less sensitive to solvent quality in denaturing solutions of GdnHCl than Gly-rich sequences.

The current literature is replete with studies aimed at mimicking the properties of vertebrate bone, teeth and other hard tissues by creating organic matrices that can be mineralized in vitro, and either functionally substitute for bone on a permanent basis, or serve as a temporary structure that can be replaced by normal remodeling processes. A key element in this is mineralization of an implant with the matrix and mineral disposed in the proper orientations and relationships. This review examines the pathway to crystallization from a supersaturated calcium phosphate solution in vitro, focusing on the basic mechanistic questions concerning mineral nucleation and growth. Since bone and dentin mineral forms within collagenous matricies we consider how the in vitro crystallization mechanisms might or might not be applicable to understanding the in vivo processes of biomineralization in bone and dentin. We propose that the pathway to crystallization from the calcium phosphate supersaturated tissue fluids involves the formation of a dense liquid phase of first-layer bound-water hydrated calcium and phosphate ions in which the crystallization is nucleated. SIBLING proteins and their in vitro analogs such as polyaspartic acids, have similar dense liquid first-layer bound water surfaces which interact with the dense liquid calcium phosphate nucleation clusters and modulate the rate of crystallization within the bone and dentin collagen fibril matrix.",

Recent work has shown that lipid membrane can induce tau aggregation and that membrane permeabilization may serve as a pathway by which protein aggregates exert toxicity, suggesting that the plasma membrane may play dual roles in tau pathology. This prompted our investigation to assess tau's propensity to interact with membranes and to elucidate the mutually disruptive structural perturbations the interactions induce in both tau and the membrane. We show that although highly charged and soluble, the full-length tau (hTau40) is also highly surface active, selectively inserts into anionic DMPG lipid monolayers and induces membrane morphological changes. To resolve molecular-scale structural details of hTau40 associated with lipid membranes, X-ray and neutron scattering techniques are utilized. X-ray reflectivity indicates hTau40's presence underneath a DMPG monolayer and penetration into the lipid headgroups and tailgroups, whereas grazing incidence X-ray diffraction shows that hTau40 insertion disrupts lipid packing. Moreover, both air/water and DMPG lipid membrane interfaces induce the disordered hTau40 to partially adopt a more compact conformation with density similar to that of a folded protein. Neutron reflectivity shows that tau completely disrupts supported DMPG bilayers while leaving the neutral DPPC bilayer intact.

Magnetically sensitive radical pairs are thought to be generated in cryptochrome proteins contained in magnetoreceptor cells in the retina. A prerequisite of the current model is for some degree of rotational ordering of both the cryptochromes within the cells and of the cells within the retina so that the directional responses of individual molecules do not average to zero. Here, it is argued that anisotropic distributions of radical pairs can be generated by the photoselection effects that arise from the directionality of the light entering the eye. Light-induced rotational order among the transient radical pairs rather than intrinsic ordering of their molecular precursors is seen as the fundamental condition for a magnetoreceptor cell to exhibit an anisotropic response.

Using both theoretical analysis and multiscale simulations, we demonstrate that the anticorrelation between the pre-mutation ΔG and the arising mutational effect (ΔΔG), purely biophysical in origin, is a necessary requirement for abundance–evolutionary rate covariation.

The intracellular transport of cholesterol among organelles is a key part of the homeostatic mechanism, but sterol transport processes are not well understood. Fluorescence microscopy is a valuable tool for studying intracellular transport processes, but this method can be challenging for lipid molecules because addition of a fluorophore may alter the properties of the molecule greatly. We discuss the use of fluorescent molecules that can bind to cholesterol to reveal its distribution in cells. We also discuss the use of intrinsically fluorescent sterols that closely mimic cholesterol, as well as some minimally modified fluorophore-labeled sterols. Methods for imaging these sterols by conventional fluorescence microscopy and by multiphoton microscopy are described. Some label-free methods for imaging cholesterol itself are also discussed briefly.",Fluorescence microscopy;multiphoton microscopy;filipin;cholesterol;dehydroergosterol;cholestatrienol;BODIPY-cholesterol

Research focuses on protein structural motifs, electrostatic surfaces and contact potentials, while DNA is often ignored as a passive polymer to be manipulated. Recent studies of DNA topology, the supercoiling, knotting, and linking of the helices, have shown that DNA has the capability to be an active participant in its transactions. DNA topology-induced structural and geometric changes can drive, or at least strongly influence, the interactions between protein and DNA. Deformations of the B-form structure arise from both the considerable elastic energy arising from supercoiling and from the electrostatic energy. Here, we discuss how these energies are harnessed for topology-driven, sequence-specific deformations that can allow DNA to direct its own metabolism.",

We exploited a combination of enhanced molecular simulations of metadynamics and NMR measurements to study heterogeneous states of proteins and peptides. In this way, we determined the structural ensemble and free-energy landscape of the highly dynamic helix 1 of the prion protein (PrP-H1), whose misfolding and aggregation are intimately connected to a group of neurodegenerative disorders known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Our combined approach allowed us to dissect the factors that govern the conformational states of PrP-H1 in solution, and the implications of these factors for prion protein misfolding and aggregation.

Backbone hydration parameters have been re-optimized based on hydration free energies of polyalanyl peptides through atomistic simulations. Also, atomistic partial charges from all-atom force fields were combined with PACE in order to provide a more realistic description of interactions between charged groups. Using replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD), ab initio folding using the new PACE has been achieved for seven small proteins (16 – 23 residues) with different structural motifs. Experimental data about folded states, such as their stability at room temperature, melting point and NMR NOE constraints, were also well reproduced. Moreover, a systematic comparison of folding kinetics at room temperature has been made with experiments, through standard MD simulations, showing that the new PACE may speed up the actual folding kinetics 5-10 times. Together with the computational speedup benefited from coarse-graining, the force field provides opportunities to study folding mechanisms. In particular, we used the new PACE to fold a 73-residue protein, 3D, in multiple 10 – 30 μs simulations, to its native states (Cα RMSD ~ 0.34 nm). Our results suggest the potential applicability of the new PACE for the study of folding and dynamics of proteins.",

However, neither a consensus CyPA-binding motif nor specific proline substrates that regulate CyPA dependence and sensitivity to cyclophilin inhibitors (CPIs) have been defined to date. We systematically characterized all proline residues in NS5A domain II, low-complexity sequence II (LCS-II), and domain III with both biochemical binding and functional replication assays. A tandem cyclophilin-binding site spanning domain II and LCS-II was identified. The first site contains a consensus sequence motif of AØPXW (where Ø is a hydrophobic residue) that is highly conserved in the majority of the genotypes of HCV (six of seven; the remaining genotype has VØPXW). The second tandem site contains a similar motif, and the ØP sequence is again conserved in six of the seven genotypes. Consistent with the similarity of their sequences, peptides representing the two binding motifs competed for CyPA binding in a spot-binding assay and induced similar chemical shifts when bound to the active site of CyPA. The two prolines (P310 and P341 of Japanese fulminant hepatitis 1 [JFH-1]) contained in these motifs, as well as a conserved tryptophan in the spacer region, were required for CyPA binding, HCV replication, and CPI resistance. Together, these data provide a high-resolution mapping of proline residues important for CyPA binding and identify critical amino acids modulating HCV susceptibility to the clinical CPI Alisporivir.",

We find that the DNA-binding domains of MutS dynamically interconvert among multiple conformations when the protein is free and while it scans homoduplex DNA. Mismatch recognition restricts MutS conformation to a single state. Steady-state measurements in the presence of nucleotides suggest that both ATP and ADP must be bound to MutS during its conversion to a sliding clamp form that signals repair.

These pathways control stress response and regulate expression of virulence factors necessary for bacterial pathogenesis. In this work, we dissect how an unusual pair of sRNAs work together to control an essential gene in Escherichia coli required to make a precursor used in the cell wall biosynthesis.","Hfq is an important RNA-binding protein that helps bacteria adapt to stress. Its primary function is to promote pairing between trans-acting small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) and their target mRNAs. Identification of essential Hfq-binding motifs in up-stream regions of rpoS and fhlA led us to ask the question whether these elements are a common occurrence among other Hfq-dependent mRNAs as well. Here, we confirm the presence of a similar (ARN)x motif in glmS RNA, a gene controlled by two sRNAs (GlmZ and GlmY) in an Hfq-dependent manner. GlmZ represents a canonical sRNA:mRNA pairing system, whereas GlmY is non-canonical, interfacing with the RNA processing protein YhbJ. We show that glmS interacts with both Hfq-binding surfaces in the absence of sRNAs. Even though two (ARN)x motifs are present, using a glmS:gfp fusion system, we determined that only one specific (ARN)x element is essential for regulation. Furthermore, we show that residues 66–72 in the C-terminal extension of Escherichia coli Hfq are essential for activation of GlmS expression by GlmY, but not with GlmZ. This result shows that the C-terminal extension of Hfq may be required for some forms of non-canonical sRNA regulation involving ancillary components such as additional RNAs or proteins.",

Different AS transcript isoforms may be translated into peptide sequences of significantly different lengths and amino acid compositions. One important question, then, is how AS is constrained by protein structural requirements while peptide sequences may be significantly changed in AS events. Here, we address this issue by examining whether the intactness of three-dimensional protein structural units (compact units in protein structures, namely protein units [PUs]) tends to be preserved in AS events in human. We show that PUs tend to occur in constitutively spliced exons and to overlap constitutive exon boundaries. Furthermore, when PUs are located at the boundaries between two alternatively spliced exons (ASEs), these neighboring ASEs tend to co-occur in different transcript isoforms. In addition, such PU-spanned ASE pairs tend to have a higher frequency of being included in transcript isoforms. ASE regions that overlap with PUs also have lower nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution rate ratios than those that do not overlap with PUs, indicating stronger negative selection pressure in PU-overlapped ASE regions. Of note, we show that PUs have protein domain- and structural orderness-independent effects on messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing. Overall, our results suggest that fine-scale protein structural requirements have significant influences on the splicing patterns of human mRNAs.",protein unit;alternative splicing;protein structural constraint

The proper function of mitochondria thus depends on folding of several hundreds of proteins in the various subcompartments of the organelle. Whereas folding of proteins in the mitochondrial matrix is supported by members of several chaperone families, very little is known about folding of proteins in the intermembrane space (IMS). We targeted dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) as a model substrate to the IMS of yeast mitochondria and analyzed its folding. DHFR can fold in this compartment, and its aggregation upon heat shock can be prevented in an ATP-dependent manner. Yme1, an AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) protease of the IMS, prevented aggregation of DHFR. Analysis of protein aggregates in mitochondria lacking Yme1 revealed the presence of a number of proteins involved in the establishment of mitochondrial ultrastructure, lipid metabolism, protein import, and respiratory growth. These findings explain the pleiotropic effects of deletion of YME1 and suggest an important role for Yme1 as a folding assistant, in addition to its proteolytic function, in the protein homeostasis of mitochondria",

As the most membrane-proximal portion of assembled clathrin, the TD is a major protein–protein interaction node. Contact with the TD β-propeller occurs through short peptide sequences typically located within intrinsically disordered segments of coat components that usually are elements of the membrane-apposed, inner ‘adaptor’ coat layer. A huge variation in TD binding motifs is known and now four spatially discrete interaction surfaces upon the β-propeller have been delineated. An important operational feature of the TD interaction sites in vivo is functional redundancy. The recent discovery that ‘pitstop’ chemical inhibitors apparently occupy only one of the four TD interactions surfaces, but potently block clathrin-mediated endocytosis, warrants careful consideration of the underlying molecular basis for this inhibition.",Clathrin-mediated endocytosis;heavy chain;terminal domain;interaction surface;β-propeller;S. cerevisiae;mutant alleles;small molecule chemical inhibitors;invagination;receptor

Despite considerable research being invested in this field, the effects of many surface-related parameters that define the binding of peptide to solids are still unknown. In the quest to control biological molecules at solid interfaces and, thereby, tailoring the binding characteristics of the peptides, the use of surface charge of the solid surface may probably play an important role, which then can be used as a potential tuning parameter of peptide adsorption. Here, we report quantitative investigation on the viscoelastic properties and binding kinetics of an engineered gold-binding peptide, 3RGBP1, adsorbed onto the gold surface at different surface charge densities. The experiments were performed in aqueous solutions using an electrochemical dissipative quartz crystal microbalance system. Hydrodynamic mass, hydration state and surface coverage of the adsorbed peptide films were determined as a function of surface charge density of the gold metal substrate. Under each charged condition, binding of 3rGBP1 displayed quantitative differences in terms of adsorbed peptide amount, surface coverage ratio and hydration state. Based on the intrinsically disordered structure of the peptide, we propose a possible mechanism for binding of the peptide that can be used for tuning surface adsorption in further studies. Controlled alteration of peptide binding on solid surfaces, as shown here, may provide novel methods for surface functionalization used for bioenabled processing and fabrication of future micro- and nanodevices.",solid-binding peptides;gold;metal surface charge;molecular recognition;adsorption

Its membrane association, allosteric activation and membrane dissociation are poorly understood. We recently reported PTEN binding affinities to membranes of different compositions and a preliminary investigation of the protein-membrane complex with neutron reflectometry (NR). Here we use NR to validate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the protein and study conformational differences of the protein in solution and on anionic membranes. NR shows that full-length PTEN binds to such membranes roughly in the conformation and orientation suggested by the crystal structure of a truncated PTEN protein, in contrast with a recently presented model which suggested that membrane binding depends critically on the SUMOylation of the CBR3 loop of PTEN’s C2 domain. Our MD simulations confirm that PTEN is peripherally bound to the bilayer surface and show slight differences of the protein structure in solution and in the membrane-bound state, where the protein body flattens against the bilayer surface. PTEN’s C2 domain binds phosphatidylserine (PS) tightly through its CBR3 loop, and its phosphatase domain also forms electrostatic interactions with PS. NR and MD results show consistently that PTEN’s unstructured, anionic C-terminal tail is repelled from the bilayer surface. In contrast, this tail is tightly tugged against the C2 domain in solution, partially obstructing the membrane-binding interface of the protein. Arresting the C-terminal tail in this conformation by phosphorylation may provide a control mechanism for PTEN’s membrane binding and activity.",PTEN phosphatase;PI3K pathway;phosphatidylserine;protein-membrane interaction;C2 domain

It was recently shown that a class of evolutionary conserved proteins, called MOAG-4/SERF, profoundly alter amyloid toxicity via an autonomous but yet unexplained mode. We show that the biological function of human SERF1a originates from its atypical ability to specifically distinguish between amyloid and nonamyloid aggregation. This inherently unstructured protein directly affected the aggregation kinetics of a broad range of amyloidogenic proteins in vitro, while being inactive against nonamyloid aggregation. A representative biophysical analysis of the SERF1a:α-synuclein (aSyn) complex revealed that the amyloid-promoting activity resulted from an early and transient interaction, which was sufficient to provoke a massive increase of soluble aSyn amyloid nucleation templates. Therefore, the autonomous amyloid-modifying activity of SERF1a observed in living organisms relies on a direct and dedicated manipulation of the early stages in the amyloid aggregation pathway.",

In the case of the KIX domain of the master coactivator CBP/p300, few small molecules have been reported that target its two allosterically regulated binding sites despite the important roles that KIX plays in processes ranging from memory formation to hematopoiesis. Taking advantage of the enrichment of aromatic amino acids at protein interfaces, here we show that the incorporation of six 19F-labeled aromatic side chains within the KIX domain enables recapitulation of the differential binding footprints of three natural activator peptides (MLL, c-Myb, and pKID) in complex with KIX and effectively reports on allosteric changes upon binding using 1D NMR spectroscopy. Additionally, the examination of both the previously described KIX protein-protein interaction inhibitor Napthol-ASE-phosphate and newly discovered ligand 1–10 rapidly revealed both the binding sites and the affinities of these small molecules. Significantly, the utility of using fluorinated transcription factors for ligand discovery was demonstrated through a fragment screen leading to a new low molecular weight fragment ligand for CBP/p300,1G7. Aromatic amino acids are enriched at protein-biomolecule interfaces; therefore, this quantitative and facile approach will be broadly useful for studying dynamic transcription complexes and screening campaigns complementing existing biophysical methods for studying these dynamic interfaces.",

In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the heat stress response involves coordinated changes at all biological levels, from gene expression to protein and metabolite abundances, and to temporary adjustments in physiology. Due to its integrative multi-level-multi-scale nature, heat adaptation constitutes a complex dynamic process, which has forced most experimental and modeling analyses in the past to focus on just one or a few of its aspects. Here we review the basic components of the heat stress response in yeast and outline what has been done, and what needs to be done, to merge the available information into computational structures that permit comprehensive diagnostics, interrogation, and interpretation. We illustrate the process in particular with the coordination of two metabolic responses, namely the dramatic accumulation of the protective disaccharide trehalose and the substantial change in the profile of sphingolipids, which in turn affect gene expression. The proposed methods primarily use differential equations in the canonical modeling framework of Biochemical Systems Theory (BST), which permits the relatively easy construction of coarse, initial models even in systems that are incompletely characterized.",biochemical systems theory;canonical modeling;dynamical model;heat stress;metabolic regulation;multi-scale control;sphingolipid metabolism;systems biology;trehalose

The discovery of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and subsequent identification of other members of the HIF family of transcriptional activators has provided insight into the molecular underpinnings of oxygen homeostasis. This review focuses on the mechanisms of HIF activation and their roles in physiological and pathophysiological responses to hypoxia, with an emphasis on the cardiorespiratory systems. HIFs are heterodimers comprised of an O2-regulated HIF-1α or HIF-2α subunit and a constitutively expressed HIF-1β subunit. Induction of HIF activity under conditions of reduced O2 availability requires stabilization of HIF-1α and HIF-2α due to reduced prolyl hydroxylation, dimerization with HIF-1β, and interaction with coactivators due to decreased asparaginyl hydroxylation. Stimuli other than hypoxia, such as nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, can also activate HIFs. HIF-1 and HIF-2 are essential for acute O2 sensing by the carotid body, and their coordinated transcriptional activation is critical for physiological adaptations to chronic hypoxia including erythropoiesis, vascularization, metabolic reprogramming, and ventilatory acclimatization. In contrast, intermittent hypoxia, which occurs in association with sleep-disordered breathing, results in an imbalance between HIF-1α and HIF-2α that causes oxidative stress, leading to cardiorespiratory pathology.",

been analyzed. Previously, we showed that the G26R mutation of apoA-I leads to
increased β-strand structure, increased N-terminal protease susceptibility, and
increased fibril formation after several days of incubation. In vivo, this and other
variants mutated in the N-terminal domain (residues 26 to ∼90) lead to renal and
hepatic accumulation. In contrast, several mutations identified within residues 170
to 178 lead to cardiac, laryngeal, and cutaneous protein deposition. Here, we
describe the structural changes in the fibrillogenic variant L178H. Like G26R, the
initial structure of the protein exhibits altered tertiary conformation relative to
wild-type protein along with decreased stability and an altered lipid binding
profile. However, in contrast to G26R, L178H undergoes an increase in helical
structure upon incubation at 37°C with a half time (t1/2) of about 12
days. Upon prolonged incubation, the L178H mutant forms fibrils of a diameter of 10
nm that ranges in length from 30 to 120 nm. These results show that apoA-I, known for
its dynamic properties, has the ability to form multiple fibrillar conformations,

However, in many cancers mdm2 is alternatively spliced, with more than 40 mRNA variants identified. Many of the alternative spliced mdm2 mRNAs have the potential to encode truncated Mdm2 isoforms. These putative Mdm2 isoforms can theoretically increase the diversity of the cancer proteome. The 3 best characterized are Mdm2-A, Mdm2-B, and Mdm2-C. As described in this review, the exogenous expression of these isoforms results in paradoxical phenotypes of transformation-associated growth as well as the inhibition of growth. Interestingly, these Mdm2 isoforms contribute tumor-promoting capacity in p53-null backgrounds. Herein we describe how alternative splicing of mdm2 may result in Mdm2 protein products that alter signal transduction to promote tumorigenesis. The tumor promoting capacity of Mdm2 isoforms is discussed in the context of functions that do not require the inhibition of p53. When N-terminal portions of Mdm2 are missing, the biochemical functions encoded by exon 12 are proposed to become more important. This may result in growth promoting functions when wild-type p53 is absent or compromised. The p53-independent tumor promoting activity of Mdm2 is proposed to result from C-terminal biochemical contributions of DNA binding, RNA binding, nucleolar localization, and nucleotide binding.",Mdm2;splicing;proteome;cancer

ERN1 acts as a direct transcriptional regulator of ENOD11 through the activation of the NF-responsive “NF box.” Here, we show that NSP1, when combined with NSP2, can act as a strong positive regulator of ERN1 and ENOD11 transcription. Although ERN1 and NSP1/NSP2 both activate ENOD11, two separate promoter regions are involved that regulate expression during consecutive symbiotic stages. Our findings indicate that ERN1 is required to activate NF-elicited ENOD11 expression exclusively during early preinfection, while NSP1/NSP2 mediates ENOD11 expression during subsequent rhizobial infection. The relative contributions of ERN1 and the closely related ERN2 to the rhizobial symbiosis were then evaluated by comparing their regulation and in vivo dynamics. ERN1 and ERN2 exhibit expression profiles compatible with roles during NF signaling and subsequent infection. However, differences in expression levels and spatiotemporal profiles suggest specialized functions for these two TFs, ERN1 being involved in stages preceding and accompanying infection thread progression while ERN2 is only involved in certain stages of infection. By cross complementation, we show that ERN2, when expressed under the control of the ERN1 promoter, can restore both NF-elicited ENOD11 expression and nodule formation in an ern1 mutant background. This indicates that ERN1 and ERN2 possess similar biological activities and that functional diversification of these closely related TFs relies primarily on changes in tissue-specific expression patterns.",

We used accurate all-atom replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations to study the relative stability of diverse sequences in the LHBH conformation. Ensemble-average coordinates from REMD served as a scoring criterion to identify sequences and threadings optimally suited to the LHBH, as in a fold recognition paradigm. We examined the repeatability of our REMD simulations, finding that single simulations can be reliable to a quantifiable extent. We find expected behavior for the positive and negative control cases of a native LHBH and intrinsically disordered sequences, respectively. Polyglutamine and a designed hexapeptide repeat show remarkable affinity for the LHBH motif. A structural model for misfolded murine prion protein was also considered, and showed intermediate stability under the given conditions. Our technique is found to be an effective probe of LHBH stability, and promises to be scalable to broader studies of this and potentially other novel or rare motifs. The superstable character of the designed hexapeptide repeat suggests theoretical and experimental follow-ups.",

In a previous study, we used all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to demonstrate that the coevolving signature in the N-terminus of S4 is intrinsically disordered and capable of accelerating the binding process through a fly-casting mechanism. In this paper, we capture the simultaneous folding and binding of the five-way junction and r-protein S4, by use of a structure-based Gō-potential implemented within the framework of the all-atom molecular dynamics CHARMM force field. Comparisons between the all-atom MD simulations and FRET experiments identify multiple metastable conformations of the naked five-way junction without the presence of S4. Using the hybrid MD-Gō simulations, different folding pathways are observed for the refolding of the five-way junction upon partial binding of S4.

Intrinsically disordered nucleoporins (Nups) form a selective filter inside the NPC, taking a central role in the vital nucleocytoplasmic transport mechanism. How such intricate meshwork relates to function and gives rise to a transport mechanism is still unclear. Here we set out to tackle this issue in intact cells by an established combination of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and real-time tracking of the center of mass of single NPCs. We find the dynamics of nucleoporin Nup153 to be regulated so as to produce rapid, discrete exchange between two separate positions within the NPC. A similar behavior is also observed for both karyopherinβ1 transport-receptor and cargoes destined to nuclear import. Thus, we argue that directed Nup-mediated molecular motion may represent an intrinsic feature of the overall selective gating through intact NPCs.",fluctuation spectroscopy;particle tracking

Lee, Email: ac.ksasu@eel.ymerej","Nanopore analysis is an emerging technique that enables the investigation of the conformation of a single peptide or protein molecule. Briefly, a pore is inserted into a membrane under voltage clamp conditions. When a molecule interacts with the pore there is a change in the current, I, for a time, T. Small unfolded molecules can translocate the pore whereas folded or large molecules tend to simply bump into the pore and then diffuse away. Therefore, the parameters, I and T, are dependent on the conformation of the molecule at the instant at which it encounters the pore. Thus, multiple conformations can be detected simultaneously in a single sample. As well, the analysis can be performed under dilute conditions so that folding or dimerization of a peptide can be followed in real time, which is generally difficult to study for proteins that are prone to aggregate. In this report, we describe our initial analysis of (1) Aβ peptides, which are deposited as amyloid plaques in Alzheimer disease, (2) α-synuclein, which is implicated in Parkinson disease and (3) prion proteins whose misfolding is evident in transmissable spongiform encephalopathies.

The R-state is a coherent metastable low-entropy state as water and K+ are bound to unfolded proteins. The A-state is the higher-entropy state because water and K+ are free. The R-to-A phase transition is regarded as a mechanism to release energy for biological work, replacing the classical concept of high-energy bonds.

A series of in vivo analyses revealed that TtuB, a bacterial ubiquitin-like protein that functions as a sulfur carrier in tRNA thiouridine synthesis, was covalently attached to target proteins, most likely via its C-terminal glycine. The involvement of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme-like protein TtuC in conjugate formation and the attachments of TtuB to TtuC and TtuA, which are proteins required for tRNA thiouridine synthesis, were demonstrated. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that lysine residues (Lys-137/Lys-226/Lys-229) of TtuA were covalently modified by the C-terminal carboxylate of TtuB. Intriguingly, a deletion mutant of a JAMM (JAB1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme) ubiquitin isopeptidase homolog showed aberrant TtuB conjugates of TtuC and TtuA and an ∼50% decrease in thiouridine amounts in tRNA.

Defects in nuclear import of FUS have been implicated in neurodegeneration, since mutations in the PY-NLS of FUS cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Moreover, FUS is deposited in the cytosol in a subset of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) patients. Here, we show that arginine methylation modulates nuclear import of FUS via a novel TRN-binding epitope. Chemical or genetic inhibition of arginine methylation restores TRN-mediated nuclear import of ALS-associated FUS mutants. The unmethylated arginine–glycine–glycine domain preceding the PY-NLS interacts with TRN and arginine methylation in this domain reduces TRN binding. Inclusions in ALS-FUS patients contain methylated FUS, while inclusions in FTLD-FUS patients are not methylated. Together with recent findings that FUS co-aggregates with two related proteins of the FET family and TRN in FTLD-FUS but not in ALS-FUS, our study provides evidence that these two diseases may be initiated by distinct pathomechanisms and implicates alterations in arginine methylation in pathogenesis.",amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS);arginine methylation;frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD);fused in sarcoma (FUS);Transportin (TRN)

RTP1p, from the rust fungi Uromyces fabae and U. striatus, was the first fungal protein for which localization within the host cytoplasm could be demonstrated directly. We investigated the occurrence of RTP1 homologues in rust fungi and examined the structural and biochemical characteristics of the corresponding gene products. The analysis of 28 homologues showed that members of the RTP family are most likely to occur ubiquitously in rust fungi and to be specific to the order Pucciniales. Sequence analyses indicated that the structure of the RTPp effectors is bipartite, consisting of a variable N‐terminus and a conserved and structured C‐terminus. The characterization of Uf‐RTP1p mutants showed that four conserved cysteine residues sustain structural stability. Furthermore, the C‐terminal domain exhibits similarities to that of cysteine protease inhibitors, and it was shown that Uf‐RTP1p and Us‐RTP1p are able to inhibit proteolytic activity in Pichia pastoris culture supernatants. We conclude that the RTP1p homologues constitute a rust fungi‐specific family of modular effector proteins comprising an unstructured N‐terminal domain and a structured C‐terminal domain, which exhibit protease inhibitory activity possibly associated with effector function during biotrophic interactions.",

We here describe novel chaperone-like functions for the secretory protein 7B2, which is widely expressed in neuronal and endocrine tissues. In in vitro experiments, 7B2 efficiently prevented fibrillation and formation of Aβ1–42, Aβ1–40, and α-synuclein aggregates at a molar ratio of 1:10. In cell culture experiments, inclusion of recombinant 7B2, either in the medium of Neuro-2A cells or intracellularly via adenoviral 7B2 overexpression, blocked the neurocytotoxic effect of Aβ1–42 and significantly increased cell viability. Conversely, knockdown of 7B2 by RNAi increased Aβ1–42-induced cytotoxicity.

junction protein connexin 40. In humans, copy number variants of chromosome 1q21.1 have
been associated with variable phenotypes comprising congenital heart disease (CHD),
including isolated TOF. In mice, the deletion of Gja5 can cause a variety of
complex CHDs, in particular of the cardiac outflow tract, corresponding to TOF in many
cases. In the present study, we screened for mutations in the GJA5 gene 178
unrelated probands with isolated TOF. A heterozygous nucleotide change (c.793C>T) in
exon 2 of the gene leading to the p.Pro265Ser variant at the carboxyl-terminus of the
protein was found in two unrelated sporadic patients, one with classic anatomy and one
with pulmonary atresia. This GJA5 missense substitution was not observed in 1568
ethnically-matched control chromosomes. Immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy
revealed that cells expressing the mutant protein form sparse or no visible gap-junction
plaques in the region of cell–cell contact. Moreover, analysis of the transfer of
the gap junction permanent tracer lucifer yellow showed that cells expressing the mutant
protein have a reduced rate of dye transfer compared with wild-type cells. Finally, use of
a zebrafish model revealed that microinjection of the GJA5-p.Pro265Ser mutant
disrupts overall morphology of the heart tube in the 37% (22/60) of embryos,
compared with the 6% (4/66) of the GJA5 wild-type-injected embryos.

Until recently, mechanisms for establishing the composition of the inner nuclear membrane (INM) remained uncharted. Current findings uncover multiple pathways for trafficking of integral and peripheral INM proteins. A major route for INM protein transport occurs through the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) with additional requirements for nuclear localization sequences, transport receptors, and Ran-GTP. Studies also reveal a putative NPC-independent vesicular pathway for NE trafficking. INM perturbations lead to changes in nuclear physiology highlighting the potential human disease impacts of continued NE discoveries.",

We hypothesized that SMP1 may protect a heat labile protein involved in the promotion of secondary dormancy. Recombinant SMP1 and GmPM28, its soybean (Glycine max), LEA4 homologue, protected the labile GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE DEHYROGENASE enzyme from heat stress, as did a known protectant, Bovine Serum Albumin, whether the LEA protein was in solution or attached to the bottom of microtiter plates. Maintenance of a biological function for both recombinant LEA proteins when immobilized encouraged a biopanning approach to screen for potential protein interactors. Phage display with two Arabidopsis seed, T7 phage, cDNA libraries, normalized for transcripts present in the mature, dehydrated, 12-, 24-, or 36-h imbibed seeds, were used in biopans against recombinant SMP1 and GmPM28. Phage titer increased considerably over four rounds of biopanning for both LEA proteins, but not for BSA, at both 25 and at 41 °C, regardless of the library used. The prevalence of multiple, independent clones encoding portions of specific proteins repeatedly retrieved from different libraries, temperatures and baits, provides evidence suggesting these LEA proteins are discriminating which proteins they protect, a novel finding.

Diffuse plaques (non-fibrous, loosely packed Aβ aggregates) containing amorphous Aβ aggregates are also formed in brain. This work examines the influence of Cu2+ complexation by Aβ on the aggregation process in the context of charge and structural variations. Changes in the surface charges of Aβ molecules due to Cu2+ binding, measured with a zeta potential measurement device, were correlated with the aggregate morphologies examined by atomic force microscopy. As a result of the charge variation, the “colloid-like” stability of the aggregation intermediates, which is essential to the fibrillation process, is affected. Consequently Cu2+ enhances the amorphous aggregate formation. By monitoring variations in the secondary structures with circular dichroism spectroscopy, a direct transformation from the unstructured conformation to the β-sheet structure was observed for all types of aggregates observed (oligomers, fibrils, and/or amorphous aggregates). Compared to the Aβ aggregation pathway in the absence of Cu2+ and taking other factors affecting Aβ aggregation (i.e., pH and temperature) into account, our investigation indicates that formations of amorphous and fibrous aggregates diverge from the same β-sheet-containing partially folded intermediate. This study suggests that the hydrophilic domain of Aβ also plays a role in the Aβ aggregation process. A kinetic model was proposed to account for the effects of the Cu2+ binding on these two aggregation pathways in terms of charge and structural variations.",

Ubiquitin ligases are central to these degradation pathways as they recognize aberrant proteins and covalently attach a polyubiquitin chain to target them to the proteasome. We discovered that the Hul5 ubiquitin ligase is a major player in a novel protein quality control pathway that targets cytosolic misfolded proteins.

A comprehensive understanding of the structural features of Aβ monomer is crucial for delineating the mechanism of Aβ oligomerization. Here we investigated the structures of Aβ40 monomer using a solid-support approach, in which Aβ40 monomers are tethered on the solid support via an N-terminal His tag to prevent further aggregation. EPR spectra of tethered Aβ40 with spin labels at 18 different positions show that Aβ40 monomers adopt a completely disordered structure under denaturing conditions. Under native conditions, however, EPR spectra suggest that Aβ40 monomers adopt both a disordered state and a structured state.

We show that the unstructured BH3-only protein, NOXA, is degraded by an Ub-independent mechanism requiring 19S regulatory particle (RP) subunits of the 26S proteasome, highlighting the possibility that other unstructured proteins reported to be degraded by 20S proteasomes in vitro may be bona fide 26S proteasome substrates in vivo. A lysine-less NOXA (NOXA-LL) mutant, which is not ubiquitinated, is degraded at a similar rate to wild-type NOXA. Myeloid cell leukemia 1, but not other anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, stabilizes NOXA by interaction with the NOXA BH3 domain. Depletion of 19S RP subunits, but not alternate proteasome activator REG subunits, increases NOXA half-life in vivo. A NOXA-LL mutant, which is not ubiquitinated, also requires an intact 26S proteasome for degradation. Depletion of the 19S non-ATPase subunit, PSMD1 induces NOXA-dependent apoptosis. Thus, disruption of 26S proteasome function by various mechanisms triggers the rapid accumulation of NOXA and subsequent cell death strongly implicating NOXA as a sensor of 26S proteasome integrity.",apoptosis;MCL-1;NOXA;proteasome;ubiquitin

Caenorhabditis elegans CLH-3b is a member of the CLC-1/2/Ka/Kb channel subfamily. CLH-3b is activated by meiotic cell-cycle progression and cell swelling. Inhibition is brought about by GCK-3 kinase-mediated phosphorylation of S742 and S747 located on a ∼176 amino acid disordered domain linking CBS1 and CBS2. Much of the inter-CBS linker is dispensable for channel regulation. However, deletion of a 14 amino acid activation domain encompassing S742 and S747 inhibits channel activity to the same extent as GCK-3. The crystal structure of CmCLC demonstrated that CBS2 interfaces extensively with an intracellular loop connecting membrane helices H and I, the C-terminus of helix D, and a short linker connecting helix R to CBS1. Point mutagenesis of this interface identified two highly conserved aromatic amino acid residues located in the H-I loop and the first α-helix (α1) of CBS2. Mutation of either residue to alanine rendered CLH-3b insensitive to GCK-3 inhibition. We suggest that the dephosphorylated activation domain normally interacts with CBS1 and/or CBS2, and that conformational information associated with this interaction is transduced through a conserved signal transduction module comprising the H-I loop and CBS2 α1.",

This study focuses on the interaction between the dynein intermediate chain subunit (IC) and a dynein regulator protein (NudE). We use isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR spectroscopy to map their interacting sections to their respective N-terminal domains, which are predicted to form dimeric coiled-coils. Interestingly, the specific residues within IC that interact with NudE are a subset of the bi-segmental binding region reported for p150Glued, a subunit of the dynein activator protein dynactin. Although the IC binding domains of both NudE and p150Glued form dimeric coiled-coils and bind IC at a common site, we observe distinct binding modes for each regulatory protein: 1) NudE binds region 1 of the bi-segmental binding footprint of p150Glued, whereas p150Glued requires regions 1 and 2 to match the binding affinity of NudE with region 1 alone. 2) Compared with unbound IC, NudE-bound IC shows a slight increase in flexibility in region 2, in contrast to the increase in ordered structure observed for p150Glued-bound IC (Morgan, J. L., Song, Y., and Barbar, E. (2011) J. Biol. Chem. 286, 39349–39359). 3) Although NudE has a higher affinity for the common binding segment on IC, when all three proteins are in solution, IC preferentially binds p150Glued.

Despite their hypothesized importance in amyloid formation, transiently occupied states have proved difficult to detect directly. To experimentally characterize these invisible states, we performed a series of CPMG based relaxation dispersion NMR experiments for the amyloidogenic Aβ1–40 peptide implicated in Alzheimer’s disease. Significant relaxation dispersion of the resonances corresponding to the side chain amides of Q15 and N27 was detected before the onset of aggregation. The resonances corresponding to the peptide backbone did not show detectable relaxation dispersion, suggesting an exchange rate that is not within the practical limit of detection. This finding is consistent with the proposed “dock and lock” mechanism based on molecular dynamics simulations in which the Aβ1–40 monomer transiently binds to the Aβ1–40 oligomer by non-native contacts with the side- chains before being incorporated into the fiber through native contacts with the peptide backbone.",Amyloid-beta;Dock and Lock;CPMG;excited state;relaxation dispersion;NMR

We identified an alternative ‘non-canonical’ pathway of MST3 activation (regulated primarily through dephosphorylation) which may also be applicable to other GCKIII (and GCKVI) subgroup members. In the basal state, inactive MST3 co-immunoprecipitated with the Golgi protein GOLGA2/gm130 (golgin A2/Golgi matrix protein 130). Activation of MST3 by calyculin A (a protein serine/threonine phosphatase 1/2A inhibitor) stimulated (auto)phosphorylation of MST3(Thr178) in the catalytic domain with essentially simultaneous cis-autophosphorylation of MST3(Thr328) in the regulatory domain, an event also requiring the MST3(341–376) sequence which acts as a putative docking domain. MST3(Thr178) phosphorylation increased MST3 kinase activity, but this activity was independent of MST3(Thr328) phosphorylation. Interestingly, MST3(Thr328) lies immediately C-terminal to a STRAD (Sterile20-related adaptor) pseudokinase-like site identified recently as being involved in binding of GCKIII/GCKVI members to MO25 scaffolding proteins. MST3(Thr178/Thr328) phosphorylation was concurrent with dissociation of MST3 from GOLGA2/gm130 and association of MST3 with MO25, and MST3(Thr328) phosphorylation was necessary for formation of the activated MST3–MO25 holocomplex.",cardiac myocyte;germinal centre kinase;mammalian Sterile20-related kinase 3 (MST3);MO25;phosphorylation;regulation

These constructs are expressed using the pCold expression system, which provides protein expression induction at low temperatures (Qing et al. 2004). Each plasmid was constructed so as to exclude the nucleotide sequence ‘ACA’, which is cleaved by E. coli MazF, allowing us to use the PSTI technology together with single protein production (SPP) technology (Suzuki et al. 2005). For construction of pCold-PSTIN and pCold-PSTIC, ACA-less PrS2-tag, ACA-less DnaEN (Nostoc punctiforme: IN) and ACA-less DnaEC (Synechocystis sp: IC) (Lockless and Muir 2009) genes were synthesized by GenScript Inc. The ACA-less PrS2-tag was inserted into pCold IV (sp-4) (Takara Bio), resulting in ACA-less pCold-PST. For pCold-PSTIN, Translation Enhancing Element (TEE consisting of MNHKV) (Etchegaray and Inouye 1999) and a His6-tag were inserted into N-terminal end of ACA-less pCold-PST, and the synthesized gene coding for IN was inserted using KpnI and BamHI sites in the multiple cloning site of pCold-PST (Kobayashi et al. 2009). For pCold-PSTIC, the synthesized gene fragment coding for IC was inserted using KpnI and NdeI sites, and a streptavidin-binding tag (Strep-tag, including the polypeptide sequence WSHPQFEK) was inserted at C-terminal end by site directed mutagenesis.

The simulations revealed a variety of loop conformers that exhibited a hydrogen bond network involving the Asp23 and Ser26 amino acids. A population of conformers, not part of the loop population, was found to form metastable β-hairpin structures with the highest probability in the Iowa mutant. At least three β-hairpin structures were found that differed in their hydrogen bonding register, average number of backbone hydrogen bonds, and lifetimes. Analysis revealed that the Dutch mutant had the longest β-hairpin lifetime (≥500ns), closely followed by the Iowa mutant (≈500ns). Aβ21–30 and the Arctic mutant had significantly lower lifetimes (≈200ns). Hydrophobic packing of side chains was responsible for enhanced β-hairpin lifetimes in the Dutch and Iowa mutants, whereas lifetimes in Aβ21–30 and its Arctic mutant were influenced by the backbone hydrogen bonding.

These processes are intricately regulated through stepwise mechanisms, requiring multiple proteins, post-translational modifications and remodeling enzymes, as well as specific proteins to chaperone the highly basic and aggregation-prone histone proteins. The histone chaperones are acidic proteins that perform the latter function by maintaining the stability of the histones when they are not associated with DNA and guiding the deposition and removal of histones from DNA. Understanding the thermodynamics of these processes provides deeper insights into the mechanisms of chromatin assembly and disassembly. Here we describe complementary thermodynamic and biochemical approaches for analysis of the interactions of a major chaperone of the H3/H4 dimer, Anti-silencing function 1 (Asf1) with histones H3/H4 and DNA. Fluorescence quenching approaches are useful for measuring the binding affinity of Asf1 for histones H3/H4 under equilibrium conditions. Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses are useful for examining Asf1 mediated tetrasome (H3/H4-DNA) assembly and disassembly processes. These approaches potentially can be used more generally for the study of other histone chaperone-histone interactions and provide a means to dissect the role of post-translational modifications and other factors that participate in chromatin dynamics.",Anti-silencing function 1 (Asf1);histone H3/H4;tetrasome;binding affinity;fluorescence;electrophoretic mobility shift assay

We studied conformational fluctuations of OspA with high-pressure 15N/1H two-dimensional NMR along with high-pressure fluorescence spectroscopy. We found evidence within folded, native OspA for rapid local fluctuations of the polypeptide backbone in the nonglobular single layer β-sheet connecting the N- and C-terminal domains with τ << ms, which may give the two domains certain independence in mobility and thermodynamic stability. Furthermore, we found that folded, native OspA is in equilibrium (τ >> ms) with a minor conformer I, which is almost fully disordered and hydrated for the entire C-terminal part of the polypeptide chain from β8 to the C-terminus. Conformer I is characterized with ΔG0 = 32 ± 9 kJ/mol and ΔV0 = −140 ± 40 mL/mol, populating only ∼0.001% at 40°C at 0.1 MPa, pH 5.9. Because in the folded conformer the receptor binding epitope of OspA is buried in the C-terminal domain, its transition into conformer I under in vivo conditions may be critical for the infection of B. burgdorferi. The formation and stability of the peculiar conformer I are apparently supported by a large packing defect or cavity located in the C-terminal domain.",

Nevertheless, most of the biochemical and biophysical studies on the structure, aggregation, and function of α-syn in vitro utilize recombinant α-syn from Escherichia coli, which is not N-terminally acetylated. To elucidate the effect of Nα-acetylation on the biophysical and biological properties of α-syn, we produced Nα-acetylated α-syn first using a semisynthetic methodology based on expressed protein ligation (Berrade, L., and Camarero, J. A. (2009) Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 66, 3909–3922) and then a recombinant expression strategy, to compare its properties to unacetylated α-syn. We demonstrate that both WT and Nα-acetylated α-syn share a similar secondary structure and oligomeric state using both purified protein preparations and in-cell NMR on E. coli overexpressing Nα-acetylated α-syn. The two proteins have very close aggregation propensities as shown by thioflavin T binding and sedimentation assays. Furthermore, both Nα-acetylated and WT α-syn exhibited similar ability to bind synaptosomal membranes in vitro and in HeLa cells, where both internalized proteins exhibited prominent cytosolic subcellular distribution. We then determined the effect of attenuating Nα-acetylation in living cells, first by using a nonacetylable mutant and then by silencing the enzyme responsible for α-syn Nα-acetylation. Both approaches revealed similar subcellular distribution and membrane binding for both the nonacetylable mutant and WT α-syn, suggesting that N-terminal acetylation does not significantly affect its structure in vitro and in intact cells.",α-Synuclein;NMR;Parkinson disease;Protein Aggregation;Protein Conformation;N-terminal Acetylation;Membrane Binding;Subcellular Localization

Mutations affecting paramutations in maize (Zea mays) identify components required for the accumulation of 24-nucleotide RNAs. Some of these components have Arabidopsis thaliana orthologs that are part of an RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. It remains unclear if small RNAs actually mediate paramutations and whether the maize-specific molecules identified to date define a mechanism distinct from RdDM. Here, we identify a novel protein required for paramutation at the maize purple plant1 locus. This required to maintain repression2 (RMR2) protein represents the founding member of a plant-specific clade of predicted proteins. We show that RMR2 is required for transcriptional repression at the Pl1-Rhoades haplotype, for accumulation of 24-nucleotide RNA species, and for maintenance of a 5-methylcytosine pattern distinct from that maintained by RNA polymerase IV. Genetic tests indicate that RMR2 is not required for paramutation occurring at the red1 locus. These results distinguish the paramutation-type mechanisms operating at specific haplotypes. The RMR2 clade of proteins provides a new entry point for understanding the diversity of epigenomic control operating in higher plants.",

To evade complement attack, the pathogenic organism Staphylococcus aureus expresses a number of secreted proteins that interfere with activation and regulation of the complement cascade. Staphylococcal complement inhibitors (SCINs) are one important class of these immunomodulators and consist of three active members (SCIN-A/-B/-C). SCINs inhibit a critical enzymatic complex, the alternative pathway C3 convertase, by targeting a functional “hot spot” on the central opsonin of complement, C3b. Although N-terminal truncation mutants of SCINs retain complement inhibitory properties, they are significantly weaker binders of C3b. To provide a structural basis for this observation, we undertook a series of crystallographic and NMR dynamics studies on full-length SCINs. This work reveals that N-terminal SCIN domains are characterized by a conformationally dynamic helical motif. C3b binding and functional experiments further demonstrate that this sequence-divergent N-terminal region of SCINs is both functionally important and context-dependent. Finally, surface plasmon resonance data provide evidence for the formation of inhibitor·enzyme·substrate complexes ((SCIN·C3bBb)·C3). Similar to the (SCIN·C3bBb)2 pseudodimeric complexes, ((SCIN·C3bBb)·C3) interferes with the interaction of complement receptors and C3b. This activity provides an additional mechanism by which SCIN couples convertase inhibition to direct blocking of phagocytosis. Together, these data suggest that tethering multi-host protein complexes by small modular bacterial inhibitors may be a global strategy of immune evasion used by S. aureus. The work presented here provides detailed structure-activity relationships and improves our understanding of how S. aureus circumvents human innate immunity.",Complement System;Innate Immunity;Protein-Protein Interactions;Staphylococcus aureus;Structural Biology

Here, in a designed system, we examine the mutational requirements for transitioning between folds and functions. We show that switching between monomeric 3α and 4β+α folds can occur in multiple ways with successive single amino acid changes at diverse residue positions, raising the likelihood that such transitions occur in the evolution of new folds. Even mutations on the periphery of the core can tip the balance between alternatively folded states. Ligand-binding studies illustrate that a new IgG-binding function can be gained well before the relevant 4β+α fold is appreciably populated in the unbound protein. The results provide new insights into the evolution of fold and function.",

Although its precise mechanism of action is not yet clear, current evidence indicates that its structure and function are regulated by the cellular peptidylprolyl isomerase cyclophilin A (CyPA). CyPA binds to proline residues in the C-terminal half of NS5A, in a distributed fashion, and modulates the structure of the disordered domains II and III. Cyclophilin inhibitors (CPIs), including cyclosporine (CsA) and its nonimmunosuppressive derivatives, inhibit HCV infection of diverse genotypes, both in vitro and in vivo. Here we report a mechanism by which CPIs inhibit HCV infection and demonstrate that CPIs can suppress HCV assembly in addition to their well-documented inhibitory effect on RNA replication. Although the interaction between NS5A and other viral proteins is not affected by CPIs, RNA binding by NS5A in cell culture-based HCV (HCVcc)-infected cells is significantly inhibited by CPI treatment, and sensitivity of RNA binding is correlated with previously characterized CyPA dependence or CsA sensitivity of HCV mutants. Furthermore, the difference in CyPA dependence between a subgenomic and a full-length replicon of JFH-1 was due, at least in part, to an additional role that CyPA plays in HCV assembly, a conclusion that is supported by experiments with the clinical CPI alisporivir. The host-directed nature and the ability to interfere with more than one step in the HCV life cycle may result in a higher genetic barrier to resistance for this class of HCV inhibitors.",

Within this context, two major areas of research in structure-based prediction that can benefit from considering protein flexibility, binding site detection and molecular docking, are discussed. Basic classification metrics and statistical analysis techniques, which can facilitate performance analysis, are also reviewed.

","Macromolecular assemblies can be intrinsically refractive to classical structural analysis, due to their size, complexity, plasticity and dynamic nature. One such assembly is the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The NPC is formed from ~450 copies of 30 different proteins, called nucleoporins, and is the sole mediator of exchange between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells. Despite significant progress, it has become increasingly clear that new approaches, integrating different sources of structural and functional data, will be needed to understand the functional biology of the NPC. Here, we discuss the latest approaches trying to address this challenge.",

Dynamic lateral assembly of protein complexes combined with an independent compositional lipid patterning in both membrane leaflets provide cells the opportunity to decorate this interface with specific proteins in an organized but dynamic manner. Such ability to dynamically reorganize the protein content of the plasma membrane is essential for the regulation of processes such as polarity of transport, development, and microbial infection. While the plant cell wall represents the first physical and mostly unspecific barrier for invading microbes, the plasma membrane is at the forefront of microbial recognition and initiation of defense responses. Accumulating evidence indicating dynamic compartmentalization of plasma membranes in response to environmental cues has increased the interest in the compositional heterogeneity of this bilayer. Here, we elucidate the recruitment of specific proteins into defined membrane structures that ensure functional compartmentalization of the bilayer during infection processes.",heterogeneity;compartmentalization;membrane domains;membrane rafts;plant immunity;receptor–ligand interactions

The solid-state structures provide insight into the dynamics of Co–O2 rotation and correlation with protecting group disorder. [Co(TpivPP)(1-EtIm)(O2)] (TpivPP = picket fence porphyrin) is prepared by oxygenation of [Co(TpivPP)(1-EtIm)2] in benzene solution. The structure at room temperature has the oxygen ligand within the ligand binding pocket and disordered over four sites and the trans imidazole is disordered over two sites. The structure at 100 K, after the crystal has been carefully annealed to yield a reversible phase change, is almost completely ordered. The phase change is reversed upon warming the crystal to 200 K, whereupon the oxygen ligand is again disordered but with quite unequal populations. Further warming to 300 K leads to greater disorder of the oxygen ligands with nearly equal O2 occupancies at all four positions. The disorder of the t-butyl groups of the protecting pickets is correlated with rotation of the O2 around the Co–O(O2) bond. [Co(TpivPP)(2-MeHIm)(O2)] is synthesized by a solid-state oxygenation reaction from the five-coordinate precursor [Co(TpivPP)(2-MeHIm)]. Exposure to 1 atm of O2 leads to incomplete oxygenation, however, exposure at 5 atm yields complete oxygenation. Complete oxygenation leads to picket disorder whereas partial (40%) oxygenation does not. Crystallinity is retained on complete degassing of oxygen in the solid, and complete ordering of the pickets is restored. The results should provide basic information needed to better model M–O2 dynamics in protein environments.",

We find that skin aging was associated with a significantly altered expression level of 2,265 coding and noncoding RNAs, of which 1,293 became “rejuvenated” after BBL treatment; i.e., they became more similar to their expression level in youthful skin. Rejuvenated genes (RGs) included several known key regulators of organismal longevity and their proximal long noncoding RNAs. Skin aging is not associated with systematic changes in 3′-end mRNA processing. Hence, BBL treatment can restore gene expression pattern of photoaged and intrinsically aged human skin to resemble young skin. In addition, our data reveal, to our knowledge, a previously unreported set of targets that may lead to new insights into the human skin aging process.",

Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of these signaling events is critical for understanding tumor suppression by p53 and development of novel therapeutics. Studies in the past decade have established that MDM2 and MDMX are important targets of signaling input from different pathways. Here, we focus our discussion on MDM2 and MDMX phosphorylation, which is important for p53 activation by DNA damage. Investigations in this area have generated new insight into the inner workings of MDM2 and MDMX and underscore the importance of allosteric communication between different domains in achieving an efficient response to phosphorylation. It is likely that MDM2 and MDMX regulation by phosphorylation will share mechanistic similarities to other signaling hub molecules. Phosphorylation-independent p53 activators such as ARF and ribosomal proteins ultimately achieve the same outcome as phosphorylation, suggesting that they may induce similar changes in the structure and function of MDM2 and MDMX through protein-protein interactions.",MDM2;MDMX;p53;phosphorylation;ubiquitination

We have used the SAA isoform, SAA2.2, from the CE/J mouse strain, as a model system to explore the inherent structural and biophysical properties of SAA. Despite its non-pathogenic nature in vivo, SAA2.2 spontaneously forms fibrils in vitro, suggesting that SAA proteins are inherently amyloidogenic. However, while the importance of the amino-terminus of SAA for fibril formation has been well documented, the influence of the proline-rich and presumably disordered carboxy-terminus remains poorly understood. To clarify the inherent role of the carboxy-terminus in the oligomerization and fibrillation of SAA, we truncated the proline-rich final 13 residues of SAA2.2. We found that unlike full-length SAA2.2, the carboxy-terminal truncated SAA2.2 (SAA2.2ΔC) did not oligomerize to a hexamer or octamer, but formed a high molecular weight soluble aggregate. Moreover, SAA2.2ΔC also exhibited a pronounced decrease in the rate of fibril formation. Intriguingly, when equimolar amounts of denatured SAA2.2 and SAA2.2ΔC were mixed and allowed to refold together, the mixture formed an octamer and exhibited rapid fibrillation kinetics, similar to those for full-length SAA2.2. These results suggest that the carboxy-terminus of SAA, which is highly conserved among SAA sequences in all vertebrates, might play important structural roles, including modulating the folding, oligomerization, misfolding, and fibrillation of SAA.",AA amyloidosis;oligomerization;Thioflavin T fluorescence;fibrils;atomic force Microscopy

Two transactivation domains, one N-terminal and one C terminal, are largely responsible for the activation functions of ICP4. A mutant ICP4 molecule lacking the C-terminal activation domain (n208) efficiently activates many early genes, whereas late genes are poorly activated, and virus growth is severely impaired. The regions within the N terminus of ICP4 (amino acids 1 to 210) that contribute to activation were investigated by analysis of deletion mutants in the presence or absence of the C-terminal activation domain. The mutants were assessed for their abilities to support viral replication and to regulate gene expression. Several deletions in regions conserved in other alphaherpesviruses resulted in impaired activation and viral growth, without affecting DNA binding. The single small deletion that had the greatest effect on activation in the absence of the C terminus corresponded to a highly conserved stretch of amino acids between 81 and 96, rendering the molecule nonfunctional. However, when the C terminus was present, the same deletion had a minimal effect on activity. The amino terminus of ICP4 was predicted to be relatively disordered compared to the DNA-binding domain and the C-terminal 500 amino acids. Moreover, the amino terminus appears to be in a relatively extended conformation as determined by the hydrodynamic properties of several mutants. The data support a model where the amino terminus is an extended and possibly flexible region of the protein, allowing it to efficiently interact with multiple transcription factors at a distance from where it is bound to DNA, thereby enabling ICP4 to function as a general activator of polymerase II transcription. The C terminus of ICP4 can compensate for some of the mutations in the N terminus, suggesting that it either specifies redundant interactions or enables the amino terminus to function more efficiently.",

While crystal structures of N- and C-terminal domains of F TraI have been determined, central domains of the protein are structurally unexplored. The central region (between residues 306 and 1520) is known to both bind single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and unwind DNA through a highly processive helicase activity. Here, we show that the ssDNA binding site is located between residues 381 and 858, and we also present the high-resolution solution structure of the N-terminus of this region (residues 381 to 569). This fragment folds into a four-strand parallel β sheet surrounded by α helices, and resembles the structure of the N-terminus of helicases such as RecD and RecQ despite little sequence similarity. The structure supports the model that F TraI resulted from duplication of a RecD-like domain and subsequent specialization of domains into the more N-terminal ssDNA binding domain and the more C-terminal domain containing helicase motifs. In addition, we provide evidence that the nickase and ssDNA binding domains of TraI are held close together by an 80-residue linker sequence that connects the two domains. These results suggest a possible physical explanation for the apparent negative cooperativity between the nickase and ssDNA binding domain.",bacterial conjugation;NMR solution structure;SAXS;SANS;ssDNA binding protein

Sensitivity and selectivity have improved because of various technical tricks and experimental designs. Here we present an exhaustive overview of the genetic approaches available to study in vivo binary protein interactions, based on two-hybrid and protein fragment complementation assays. These methods have been engineered and employed successfully in microorganisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli, but also in higher eukaryotes. From single binary pairwise interactions to whole-genome interactome mapping, the self-reassembly concept has been employed widely. Innovative studies report the use of proteins such as ubiquitin, dihydrofolate reductase, and adenylate cyclase as reconstituted reporters. Protein fragment complementation assays have extended the possibilities in protein-protein interaction studies, with technologies that enable spatial and temporal analyses of protein complexes. In addition, one-hybrid and three-hybrid systems have broadened the types of interactions that can be studied and the findings that can be obtained. Applications of these technologies are discussed, together with the advantages and limitations of the available assays.",

In this review, we discuss 1) the development of the energy landscape theory of biomolecular folding, 2) recent advances towards establishing a consistent understanding of folding and function, and 3) emerging themes in the functional motions of enzymes, biomolecular motors, and other biomolecular machines. Recent theoretical, computational, and experimental lines of investigation are providing a very dynamic picture of biomolecular motion. In contrast to earlier ideas, where molecular machines were thought to function similarly to macroscopic machines, with rigid components that move along a few degrees of freedom in a deterministic fashion, biomolecular complexes are only marginally stable. Since the stabilizing contribution of each atomic interaction is on the order of the thermal fluctuations in solution, the rigid body description of molecular function must be revisited. An emerging theme is that functional motions encompass order-disorder transitions and structural flexibility provide significant contributions to the free-energy. In this review, we describe the biological importance of order-disorder transitions and discuss the statistical-mechanical foundation of theoretical approaches that can characterize such transitions.",

This is exemplified in Salmonella spp. by the zirTS antivirulence genes: a secretion pathway comprised of the outer membrane transporter ZirT, and its secreted partner, ZirS. ZirTS act within the gastrointestinal tract to function as a virulence modulator and during Salmonella shedding in anticipation of a new host. Together, ZirT and ZirS decrease virulence by lowering bacterial colonization at systemic sites through an unknown mechanism. To understand this mechanism, we have probed the zirTS pathway both structurally and biochemically. The NMR derived structural ensemble of the C-terminal domain of ZirS reveals an immunoglobin superfamily fold (IgSF). Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture experiments show that the ZirS IgSF domain interacts with its transporter ZirT, and reveal a new protein interaction partner of the pathway, a protein encoded adjacent to zirTS that we have designated as ZirU. ZirU is secreted by ZirT and is also a predicted IgSF. Biochemical analysis delineates ZirT into an N-terminal porin-like β domain and C-terminal extracellular soluble IgSF domain, whereas biophysical characterization suggests that the transporter undergoes self-association in a concentration-dependent manner. We observe that ZirS and ZirU directly interact with each other and with the extracellular domains of ZirT. Here we show that the zir antivirulence pathway is a multiprotein immunoglobulin adhesion system consisting of a complex interplay between ZirS, ZirT, and ZirU.",Mass Spectrometry (MS);Membrane Proteins;Microbial Pathogenesis;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance;Structural Biology;Antivirulence;SILAC;Salmonella;ZirS;ZirT

Conversely, the CE/J type mouse expresses a single non-pathogenic SAA2.2 protein that is 94% identical to SAA1.1. Here we show that SAA1.1 and SAA2.2 differ in their quaternary structure, fibrillation kinetics, prefibrillar oligomers, and fibril morphology. At 37 °C and inflammation-related SAA concentrations, SAA1.1 exhibits an oligomer-rich fibrillation lag phase of a few days, whereas SAA2.2 shows virtually no lag phase and forms small fibrils within a few hours. Deep UV resonance Raman, far UV-circular dichroism, atomic force microscopy, and fibrillation cross-seeding experiments suggest that SAA1.1 and SAA2.2 fibrils possess different morphology.

Indeed, genome sequencing reveals that pathogenic Leptospira species are richly endowed with sphingomyelinase homologues: five genes have been annotated to encode sphingomyelinases in Leptospira interrogans. Such redundancy suggests that this class of genes is likely to benefit leptospiral pathogens in their interactions with the mammalian host. Surprisingly, sequence comparison with bacterial sphingomyelinases for which the crystal structures are known reveals that only one of the leptospiral homologues has the active site amino acid residues required for enzymic activity. Based on studies of other bacterial toxins, we propose that leptospiral sphingomyelinase homologues, irrespective of their catalytic activity, may possess additional molecular functions that benefit the spirochaete. Potential secretion pathways and roles in pathogenesis are discussed, including nutrient acquisition, dissemination, haemorrhage and immune evasion. Although leptospiral sphingomyelinase-like proteins are best known for their cytolytic properties, we believe that a better understanding of their biological role requires the examination of their sublytic properties as well.",

","The evolution of minimal DNA tumor virus’ genomes has selected for small oncoproteins that hijack critical cellular protein interaction networks. The structural basis for the dominant interactions of adenovirus oncoproteins has remained elusive as no full-length structures have been solved. Adenovirus E4-ORF3 forms a nuclear scaffold and simultaneously inactivates p53, PML, TRIM24 and MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) tumor suppressors. We identify oligomerization mutants and solve the crystal structure of an E4-ORF3 dimer. The structure of E4-ORF3 is unrelated to known polymers or oncogenes. E4-ORF3 dimers have a central β-core and co-assemble in multiple configurations by exchanging their C-terminal tails. The resulting polymers are disordered weaves of linear and branched oligomer threads that form a 3D network that partitions the nucleus. The assembly of E4-ORF3 creates avidity driven interactions with PML and an emergent MRN binding interface. This study unveils an elegant solution whereby a small domain forms a multivalent polymer to disrupt multiple protein complexes.",

Despite 130 million people being at risk worldwide, no vaccine exists, and effective therapy is limited by drug resistance, toxicity, and high costs. The tetraspanin CD81 is an essential entry-level receptor required for HCV infection of hepatocytes and represents a critical target for intervention. In this study, we report the first structural characterization of the large extracellular loop of CD81, expressed in mammalian cells and studied in physiological solutions. The HCV E2 glycoprotein recognizes CD81 through a dynamic loop on the helical bundle, which was shown by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to adopt a conformation distinct from that seen in crystals. A novel membrane binding interface was revealed adjacent to the exposed HCV interaction site in the extracellular loop of CD81. The binding pockets for two proposed inhibitors of the CD81-HCV interaction, namely, benzyl salicylate and fexofenadine, were shown to overlap the HCV and membrane interaction sites. Although the dynamic loop region targeted by these compounds presents challenges for structure-based design, the NMR assignments enable realistic screening and validation of ligands. Together, these data provide an improved avenue for developing potent agents that specifically block CD81-HCV interaction and also pave a way for elucidating the recognition mechanisms of diverse tetraspanins.",

The control of DNA damage repair mechanisms by BRCA1 is of great interest since molecular defects in this pathway may reflect a predictive value in terms of a cell’s sensitivity to DNA damaging agents or anticancer drugs. BRCA1 has been found to exhibit a hormone-dependent pattern of expression in breast cells. Wild-type BRCA1 is required for the inhibition of the growth of breast tumor cells in response to the pure steroidal ERα antagonist fulvestrant. Also a loss of BRCA1-mediated transcriptional activation of ERα expression results in increased resistance to ERα antagonists. Platinum-based drugs, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, and their combination are currently included in chemotherapy regimens for breast cancer. Preclinical and clinical studies in a BRCA1-defective setting have recently indicated a rationale for the use of these compounds against hereditary breast cancers. Initial findings indicate that neoadjuvant use of cisplatin results in high rates of complete pathological response in patients with breast cancer who have BRCA1 mutations. Cisplatin produces a better response in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) than in non-TNBC diseases in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. This implies that TNBC cells may harbor a dysfunctional BRCA1 repair pathway.",BRCA1;estrogen receptor;fulvestrant;antiestrogen;triple-negative breast cancer

To better resolve the spatial organization of the DHPR subunits (α1s or CaV1.1, α2, β1a, δ1, and γ), we created transgenic mice expressing a recombinant β1a subunit with YFP and a biotin acceptor domain attached to its N- and C- termini, respectively. DHPR complexes were purified from skeletal muscle, negatively stained, imaged by electron microscopy, and subjected to single-particle image analysis. The resulting 19.1-Å resolution, three-dimensional reconstruction shows a main body of 17 × 11 × 8 nm with five corners along its perimeter. Two protrusions emerge from either face of the main body: the larger one attributed to the α2-δ1 subunit that forms a flexible hook-shaped feature and a smaller protrusion on the opposite side that corresponds to the II-III loop of CaV1.1 as revealed by antibody labeling. Novel features discernible in the electron density accommodate the atomic coordinates of a voltage-gated sodium channel and of the β subunit in a single docking possibility that defines the α1-β interaction. The β subunit appears more closely associated to the membrane than expected, which may better account for both its role in localizing the α1s subunit to the membrane and its suggested role in excitation-contraction coupling.",Calcium Channels;Cell Signaling;Electron Microscopy (EM);Excitation-Contraction Coupling;Protein Expression;3D Reconstruction;Cav1.1;Dihydropyridine Receptor;L-type Channel;Protein Structure

A critical determinant of epithelial adhesive strength is the level and organization of desmosomal cadherins on the cell surface. The Dsg subclass of desmosomal cadherins contains a C-terminal unique region (Dsg unique region [DUR]) with unknown function. In this paper, we show that the DUR of Dsg2 stabilized Dsg2 at the cell surface by inhibiting its internalization and promoted strong intercellular adhesion. DUR also facilitated Dsg tail–tail interactions. Forced dimerization of a Dsg2 tail lacking the DUR led to decreased internalization, supporting the conclusion that these two functions of the DUR are mechanistically linked. We also show that a Dsg2 mutant, V977fsX1006, identified in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy patients, led to a loss of Dsg2 tail self-association and underwent rapid endocytosis in cardiac muscle cells. Our observations illustrate a new mechanism desmosomal cadherins use to control their surface levels, a key factor in determining their adhesion and signaling roles.",

Many studies have shown that the four PLC-β subtypes have different physiological functions despite their similar structures. Because the PLC-β subtypes possess different PDZ-binding motifs, they have the potential to interact with different PDZ proteins. In this study, we identified PDZ domain-containing 1 (PDZK1) as a PDZ protein that specifically interacts with PLC-β3. To elucidate the functional roles of PDZK1, we next screened for potential interacting proteins of PDZK1 and identified the somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) as another protein that interacts with PDZK1. Through these interactions, PDZK1 assembles as a ternary complex with PLC-β3 and SSTRs. Interestingly, the expression of PDZK1 and PLC-β3, but not PLC-β1, markedly potentiated SST-induced PLC activation. However, disruption of the ternary complex inhibited SST-induced PLC activation, which suggests that PDZK1-mediated complex formation is required for the specific activation of PLC-β3 by SST. Consistent with this observation, the knockdown of PDZK1 or PLC-β3, but not that of PLC-β1, significantly inhibited SST-induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, which further attenuated subsequent ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the formation of a complex between SSTRs, PDZK1, and PLC-β3 is essential for the specific activation of PLC-β3 and the subsequent physiologic responses by SST.",Bioinformatics;Calcium Signaling;G Protein-coupled Receptors (GPCR);Phospholipase C;Scaffold Proteins;PDZ Protein;PDZK1;Somatostatin

Remorins are a plant-specific family of proteins organized in six phylogenetic groups, and Remorins of group 1 are among the few plant proteins known to specifically associate with membrane rafts. As such, they are valuable to understand the molecular bases for PM lateral organization in plants. However, little is known about the structural determinants underlying the specific association of group 1 Remorins with membrane rafts. We used a structure-function approach to identify a short C-terminal anchor (RemCA) indispensable and sufficient for tight direct binding of potato (Solanum tuberosum) REMORIN 1.3 (StREM1.3) to the PM. RemCA switches from unordered to α-helical structure in a nonpolar environment. Protein structure modeling indicates that RemCA folds into a tight hairpin of amphipathic helices. Consistently, mutations reducing RemCA amphipathy abolished StREM1.3 PM localization. Furthermore, RemCA directly binds to biological membranes in vitro, shows higher affinity for Detergent-Insoluble Membranes lipids, and targets yellow fluorescent protein to Detergent-Insoluble Membranes in vivo. Mutations in RemCA resulting in cytoplasmic StREM1.3 localization abolish StREM1.3 function in restricting potato virus X movement. The mechanisms described here provide new insights on the control and function of lateral segregation of plant PM.",

As with other transition metals, these trafficking systems must be able to distinguish between the desired metal and other transition metal ions with similar physical and chemical properties. Because there are few enzymes (targets) that require nickel for activity (e.g., E. coli traffics nickel for hydrogenases made under anaerobic conditions and H. pylori requires nickel for hydrogenase and urease that are essential for acid viability), the ‘traffic pattern’ for nickel is relatively simple, and nickel trafficking therefore presents an opportunity to examine a system for the mechanisms that are used to distinguish nickel from other metals. In this review, we describe the details known for examples of uptake permeases, metallochaperones and proteins involved in metallocenter assembly, and nickel metalloregulators. We also illustrate the variety of mechanisms, including molecular recognition in the case of NikA protein and examples of allosteric regulation for HypA, NikR and RcnR, employed to generate specific biological responses to nickel ions.",

The later part of 20th century witnessed the first descriptions of the cellular responses and electrophysiology of isolated and cultured type I and type II cells, and there now exist a number of testable hypotheses of chemotransduction. The goal of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of current concepts on sensory transduction and transmission of the hypoxic stimulus at the carotid body with an emphasis on integrating cellular mechanisms with the whole organ responses and highlighting the gaps or discrepancies in our knowledge. It is increasingly evident that in addition to hypoxia, the carotid body responds to a wide variety of blood-borne stimuli, including reduced glucose and immune-related cytokines and we therefore also consider the evidence for a polymodal function of the carotid body and its implications. It is clear that the sensory function of the carotid body exhibits considerable plasticity in response to the chronic perturbations in environmental O2 that is associated with many physiological and pathological conditions. The mechanisms and consequences of carotid body plasticity in health and disease are discussed in the final sections of this article.",

Here we report a high-resolution structure of a TRIM5α PRYSPRY domain, the PRYSPRY of the rhesus monkey TRIM5α that potently restricts HIV infection, and identify features involved in its interaction with the HIV capsid. The extensive capsid-binding interface maps on the structurally divergent face of the protein formed by hypervariable loop segments, confirming that TRIM5α evolution is largely determined by its binding specificity. Interactions with the capsid are mediated by flexible variable loops via a mechanism that parallels antigen recognition by IgM antibodies, a similarity that may help explain some of the unusual functional properties of TRIM5α. Distinctive features of this pathogen-recognition interface, such as structural plasticity conferred by the mobile v1 segment and interaction with multiple epitopes, may allow restriction of divergent retroviruses and increase resistance to capsid mutations.",

The oligomers formed as a result of the structural conversion generate much higher levels of oxidative stress in rat primary neurons than do the oligomers formed initially, showing that they are more damaging to cells. The structural conversion is remarkably slow, indicating a high kinetic barrier for the conversion and suggesting that there is a significant period of time for the cellular protective machinery to operate and potentially for therapeutic intervention, prior to the onset of cellular damage. In the absence of added soluble protein, the assembly process is reversed and fibrils disaggregate to form stable oligomers, hence acting as a source of cytotoxic species.",

Viral proteins target highly central human proteins, which are precisely the Achilles' heel of the human interactome. The intrinsic structural disorder is a distinctive feature of viral hubs in virus-host interactomes. Overlaps between virus-host data sets identify a core of human proteins involved in the cellular response to viral infection and in the viral capacity to hijack the cell machinery for viral replication.

We discovered that although LC8 is a subunit of the radial spoke (RS) complex in Chlamydomonas flagella, it was undetectable in the RS precursor that is converted into the mature RS at the tip of elongating axonemes. Interestingly, LC8 dimers bound in tandem to the N-terminal region of a spoke phosphoprotein, RS protein 3 (RSP3), that docks RSs to axonemes. LC8 enhanced the binding of RSP3 N-terminal fragments to purified axonemes. Likewise, the N-terminal fragments extracted from axonemes contained LC8 and putative spoke-docking proteins. Lastly, perturbations of RSP3’s LC8-binding sites resulted in asynchronous flagella with hypophosphorylated RSP3 and defective associations between LC8, RSs, and axonemes. We propose that at the tip of flagella, an array of LC8 dimers binds to RSP3 in RS precursors, triggering phosphorylation, stalk base formation, and axoneme targeting. These multiple effects shed new light on fundamental questions about LC8-containing complexes and axoneme assembly.",

Using complementary techniques, we have investigated the biochemical and biophysical properties of Dre2. We show that it contains an N-terminal domain whose structure in solution consists of a stable well-structured monomer with an overall typical S-adenosylmethionine methyltransferase fold lacking two α-helices and a β-strand. The highly conserved C-terminus of Dre2, containing two Fe-S clusters, influences the flexibility of the N-terminal domain.

Here, we investigated the structural and conformational states of the D-loop (in solution) using cysteine scanning mutagenesis and site-directed labeling. The reactivity of D-loop cysteine mutants toward acrylodan and the mobility of spin labels on these mutants do not show patterns of an α-helical structure in monomeric and filamentous actin, irrespective of the bound nucleotide. Upon transition from monomeric to filamentous actin, acrylodan emission spectra and electron paramagnetic resonance line shapes of labeled mutants are blue-shifted and more immobilized, respectively, with the central residues (residues 43–47) showing the most drastic changes. Moreover, complex electron paramagnetic resonance line shapes of spin-labeled mutants suggest several conformational states of the D-loop. Together with a new (to our knowledge) actin crystal structure that reveals the D-loop in a unique hairpin conformation, our data suggest that the D-loop equilibrates in F-actin among different conformational states irrespective of the nucleotide state of actin.",

Despite their simple one-dimensional structure, repeat proteins exhibit intricate folding behavior with a complexity similar to that of globular proteins. Therefore, repeat proteins allow one to quantify fundamental aspects of the biophysics of protein folding. One important feature of repeat proteins is the interfaces between the repeating units. In particular, the distribution of stabilities within and between the repeats was previously suggested to affect their folding characteristics. In this study, we explore how the interface affects folding kinetics and cooperativity by investigating two families of repeat proteins, namely, the Ankyrin and tetratricopeptide repeat proteins, which differ in the number of interfacial contacts that are formed between their units as well as in their folding behavior. By using simple topology-based models, we show that modulating the energetic strength of the interface relative to that of the repeat itself can drastically change the protein stability, folding rate, and cooperativity. By further dissecting the interfacial contacts into several subsets, we isolated the effects of each of these groups on folding kinetics. Our study highlights the importance of interface connectivity in determining the folding behavior.",

APP is characterized by a large extracellular domain and a short cytosolic domain termed the APP intracellular domain (AICD). During maturation through the secretory pathway, APP can be cleaved by proteases termed α, β, and γ-secretases1. Sequential proteolytic cleavage of APP with β and γ-secretases leads to the production of a small proteolytic peptide, termed Aβ, which is amyloidogenic and the core constituent of senile plaques. The AICD is also liberated from the membrane after secretase processing, and through interactions with Fe65 and Tip60, can translocate to the nucleus to participate in transcription regulation of multiple target genes2,3. Protein-protein interactions involving the AICD may affect trafficking, processing, and cellular functions of holo-APP and its C-terminal fragments. We have recently shown that AICD can aggregate in vitro, and this process is inhibited by the AD-implicated molecular chaperone ubiquilin-14. Consistent with these findings, the AICD has exposed hydrophobic domains and is intrinsically disordered in vitro5,6, however it obtains stable secondary structure when bound to Fe657. We have proposed that ubiquilin-1 prevents inappropriate inter- and intramolecular interactions of AICD, preventing aggregation in vitro and in intact cells4. While most studies focus on the role of APP in the pathogenesis of AD, the role of AICD in this process is not clear. Expression of AICD has been shown to induce apoptosis8, to modulate signaling pathways9, and to regulate calcium signaling10. Over-expression of AICD and Fe65 in a transgenic mouse model induces Alzheimer's like pathology11, and recently AICD has been detected in brain lysates by western blotting when using appropriate antigen retrieval techniques12. To facilitate structural, biochemical, and biophysical studies of the AICD, we have developed a procedure to produce recombinantly large amounts of highly pure AICD protein. We further describe a method for inducing the in vitro thermal aggregation of AICD and analysis by atomic force microscopy. The methods described are useful for biochemical, biophysical, and structural characterization of the AICD and the effects of molecular chaperones on AICD aggregation.",Medicine;Issue 66;Neuroscience;Cellular Biology;Molecular Biology;Amyloid precursor protein;APP;AICD;Alzheimer's Disease;Atomic Force Microscopy;Aggregation;Ubiquilin-1;Molecular Chaperone

To compare the targeting of these GTPase receptors, we identified two Toc159 isoforms and a Toc34 from Bienertia sinuspersici, a single-cell C4 species with dimorphic chloroplasts in individual chlorenchyma cells. Fluorescent protein tagging and immunogold studies revealed that the localization patterns of Toc159 were distinctive from those of Toc34, suggesting different targeting pathways. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that the C-terminal tails (CTs) of Toc159 possess physicochemical and structural properties of chloroplast transit peptides (cTPs). These results were further confirmed by fluorescent protein tagging, which showed the targeting of CT fusion proteins to the chloroplast surface. The CT of Bs Toc159 in reverse orientation functioned as a cleavable cTP that guided the fluorescent protein to the stroma. Moreover, a Bs Toc34 mutant protein was retargeted to the chloroplast envelope using the CTs of Toc159 or reverse sequences of other cTPs, suggesting their conserved functions. Together, our data show that the C terminus and the central GTPase domain represent a novel dual domain–mediated sorting mechanism that might account for the partitioning of Toc159 between the cytosol and the chloroplast envelope for preprotein recognition.",

The combination of excellent mechanical and corrosion resistance properties makes them highly desirable as endosseous implants that can withstand a demanding biomechanical environment. Yet, the success of the implant depends on its osteointegration, which is modulated by the biological reactions occurring at the interface of the implant. A recent development for improving biological responses on the Ti-implant surface has been the realization that bifunctional peptides can impart material binding specificity not only because of their molecular recognition of the inorganic material surface, but also through their self-assembly and ease of biological conjugation properties. To assess peptide-based functionalization on bioactivity, the present authors generated a set of peptides for implant-grade Ti, using cell surface display methods. Out of 60 unique peptides selected by this method, two of the strongest titanium binding peptides, TiBP1 and TiBP2, were further characterized for molecular structure and adsorption properties. These two peptides demonstrated unique, but similar molecular conformations different from that of a weak binder peptide, TiBP60. Adsorption measurements on a Ti surface revealed that their disassociation constants were 15-fold less than TiBP60. Their flexible and modular use in biological surface functionalization were demonstrated by conjugating them with an integrin recognizing peptide motif, RGDS. The functionalization of the Ti surface by the selected peptides significantly enhanced the bioactivity of osteoblast and fibroblast cells on implant-grade materials.",Implants;Titanium binding peptide;Molecular recognition;Biomaterial interface;Bioenabled surface modification

Functionally, the m-domain is thought to directly interact with myosin, whereas phosphorylation of the m-domain has been shown to modulate interactions between myosin and actin. Here we utilized NMR to analyze the structure and dynamics of the m-domain in solution. Our studies reveal that the m-domain is composed of two subdomains, a largely disordered N-terminal portion containing three known phosphorylation sites and a more ordered and folded C-terminal portion. Chemical shift analyses, dNN(i, i + 1) NOEs, and 15N{1H} heteronuclear NOE values show that the C-terminal subdomain (residues 315–351) is structured with three well defined helices spanning residues 317–322, 327–335, and 341–348. The tertiary structure was calculated with CS-Rosetta using complete 13Cα, 13Cβ, 13C′, 15N, 1Hα, and 1HN chemical shifts. An ensemble of 20 acceptable structures was selected to represent the C-terminal subdomain that exhibits a novel three-helix bundle fold. The solvent-exposed face of the third helix was found to contain the basic actin-binding motif LK(R/K)XK. In contrast, 15N{1H} heteronuclear NOE values for the N-terminal subdomain are consistent with a more conformationally flexible region. Secondary structure propensity scores indicate two transient helices spanning residues 265–268 and 293–295. The presence of both transient helices is supported by weak sequential dNN(i, i + 1) NOEs.

Enrichment of the variant forms of UreF, as the UreE-F fusion proteins, uniformly resulted in co-purification of UreD and urease apoprotein; whereas UreG bound to only a subset of the species. Notably, reduced interaction with UreG correlated with the low activity mutants. The affected residues in UreF map to a distinct surface on the crystal structure, defining the UreG binding site. In contrast to the hypothesis that UreF is a GAP, the UreD—UreF—UreG—urease apoprotein complex containing K165A UreF exhibited significantly greater levels of GTPase activity than that containing the wild-type protein. Additional studies demonstrated the UreG GTPase activity was largely uncoupled from urease activation for the complex containing this UreF variant. Further experiments with these complexes provided evidence that UreF gates the GTPase activity of UreG to enhance the fidelity of urease metallocenter assembly, especially in the presence of the non-cognate metal Zn.",

Amelogenin is soluble at low pH and self-assembles to form higher order structures at physiological pH. To understand the mechanisms of its assembly and interactions with calcium phosphate mineral, we conducted FTIR spectroscopy (FTIRS) studies of pH-triggered assembly of recombinant porcine amelogenin rP172 and its interactions with mature hydroxyapatite and apatitic mineral formed in situ. Analysis of our data indicated that rP172 at pH 3.0 exists in an unfolded disordered state, while increases in pH led to structural ordering, manifested by increases in intra- and intermolecular β-sheet structures and a decrease in random coil and β-turns. Amelogenin assembled at pH 7.2 was also found to contain large portions of extended intramolecular β-sheet and PPII. These FTIRS findings are consistent with those previously obtained with other techniques, thus verifying the validity of our experimental approach. Interestingly, interactions with mineral led to a reduction in protein structural organization. The findings obtained show that amelogenin has intrinsic structural flexibility to accommodate interactions with both forming and mature calcium phosphate mineral phases, providing new insights into the potential importance of amelogenin-mineral interactions in enamel biomineralization.",enamel;hydroxyapatite;protein self-assembly;protein-mineral interactions;biomineralization;intrinsically disordered protein

","The discovery that alpha-synuclein (α-syn) is the primary component of the neuropathological hallmarks of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and the identification of α-syn mutations in numerous inherited forms of PD has positioned α-syn at the top of the list of important factors in the pathogenesis of PD. Based on the pathological accumulation of α-syn in the brains of patients, the field is currently focused on therapeutic strategies that aim to reduce or eliminate α-syn. However, recent evidence suggests α-syn is a critical protein in neuron (i.e. dopamine neurons) survival and that maintaining a certain level of biologically functional α-syn is an important consideration in targeting α-syn for therapies. Despite the widespread interest in α-syn, the normal biological functions remain elusive, but a large body of work is focused on addressing this issue. In this review, we will discuss the current evidence related to α-syn function, α-syn folding and aggregation, and α-syn’s role in disease. Finally, we will propose a relatively novel hypothesis on the pathogenesis of PD that hinges upon the premises that functional α-syn is critical to cell survival and that a reduction in biologically functional α-syn, whether through aggregation or reduced expression, may lead to the neurodegeneration in PD.",Parkinson’s disease;alpha-synuclein;neurodegenerative disease;dopamine;lewy body

We compare pyrimidine content of naturally occurring mRNA coding sequences with the propensity of cognate protein sequences to interact with pyrimidines. The latter is captured by polar requirement, a measure of solubility of amino acids in aqueous solutions of pyridines, heterocycles closely related to pyrimidines. We find that the higher the pyrimidine content of an mRNA, the stronger the average propensity of its cognate protein’s amino acids to interact with pyridines. Moreover, window-averaged pyrimidine profiles of individual mRNAs strongly mirror polar-requirement profiles of cognate protein sequences. For example, 4953 human proteins exhibit a correlation between the two with |R| > 0.8. In other words, pyrimidine-rich mRNA regions quantitatively correspond to regions in cognate proteins containing residues soluble in pyrimidine mimetics and vice versa. Finally, by studying randomized genetic code variants we show that the universal genetic code is highly optimized to preserve these correlations. Overall, our findings redefine the stereo-chemical hypothesis concerning code’s origin and provide evidence of direct complementary interactions between mRNAs and cognate proteins before development of ribosomal decoding, but also presently, especially if both are unstructured.",

Associate editor: Daniel Falush","New protein-coding genes can originate either through modification of existing genes or de novo. Recently, the importance of de novo origination has been recognized in eukaryotes, although eukaryotic genes originated de novo are relatively rare and difficult to identify. In contrast, viruses contain many de novo genes, namely those in which an existing gene has been “overprinted” by a new open reading frame, a process that generates a new protein-coding gene overlapping the ancestral gene. We analyzed the evolution of 12 experimentally validated viral genes that originated de novo and estimated their relative ages. We found that young de novo genes have a different codon usage from the rest of the genome. They evolve rapidly and are under positive or weak purifying selection. Thus, young de novo genes might have strain-specific functions, or no function, and would be difficult to detect using current genome annotation methods that rely on the sequence signature of purifying selection. In contrast to young de novo genes, older de novo genes have a codon usage that is similar to the rest of the genome. They evolve slowly and are under stronger purifying selection. Some of the oldest de novo genes evolve under stronger selection pressure than the ancestral gene they overlap, suggesting an evolutionary tug of war between the ancestral and the de novo gene.",overlapping genes;de novo origin;new genes

Progress in understanding the molecular details of these two functions has been hampered by the lack of structural data on TIP47, with a crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of the mouse homologue constituting the only structural data in the literature so far. Our studies have first provided a strategy to obtain pure monodisperse preparations of the full-length TIP47/perilipin-3 protein, as well as a series of N-terminal truncation mutants with no exogenous sequences. These constructs have then enabled us to obtain the first structural characterization of the full-length protein in solution. Our work demonstrates that the N-terminal region of TIP47/perilipin-3, in contrast to the largely helical C-terminal region, is predominantly β-structure with turns and bends. Moreover, we show that full-length TIP47/perilipin-3 adopts an extended conformation in solution, with considerable spatial separation of the N- and C-termini that would likely translate into a separation of functional domains.",circular dichroism;multiangle laser light scattering;oligomerization state;small-angle X-ray scattering;tail-interacting protein of 47 kDaa

In this study, we purified yeast THO and found Tex1 to be part of its core. We determined the three-dimensional structures of five-subunit THO complex by electron microscopy and located the positions of Tex1, Hpr1, and Tho2 C-terminus using various labelling techniques. In the case of Tex1, a β-propeller protein, we have generated an atomic model which docks into the corresponding part of the THO complex envelope. Furthermore, we show that THO directly interacts with nucleic acids through the unfolded C-terminal region of Tho2, whose removal reduces THO recruitment to active chromatin leading to mRNA biogenesis defects. In summary, this study describes the THO architecture, the structural basis for its chromatin targeting, and highlights the importance of unfolded regions of eukaryotic proteins.",electron microscopy;mRNA export;mRNP quality control;THO complex;TREX complex

This transport is regulated at multiple levels, and the NPC itself also plays a key regulatory role in gene expression by influencing nuclear architecture and acting as a point of control for various nuclear processes. Here we summarize how the yeast Saccharomyces has been used extensively as a model system to understand the fundamental and highly conserved features of this transport system, revealing the structure and function of the NPC; the NPC’s role in the regulation of gene expression; and the interactions of transport factors with their cargoes, regulatory factors, and specific nucleoporins.",

An important class of protein–protein interaction corresponds to peptide-mediated interactions, in which a short peptide stretch from one partner interacts with a large protein surface from the other partner. Protein–peptide interactions are typically of low affinity and involved in regulatory mechanisms, dynamically reshaping protein interaction networks. Due to the relatively small interaction surface, modulation of protein–peptide interactions is feasible and highly attractive for therapeutic purposes. Unfortunately, the number of available 3D structures of protein–peptide interfaces is very limited. For typical cases where a protein–peptide structure of interest is not available, the PepSite web server can be used to predict peptide-binding spots from protein surfaces alone. The PepSite method relies on preferred peptide-binding environments calculated from a set of known protein–peptide 3D structures, combined with distance constraints derived from known peptides. We present an updated version of the web server that is orders of magnitude faster than the original implementation, returning results in seconds instead of minutes or hours.

In addition, all eukaryotic cells contain multiple heat-stable proteins that originally were thought to inhibit phosphatase catalytic subunits released from the regulatory subunits, as a fail-safe mechanism. However, discovery of CPI-17 required fresh thinking about the endogenous inhibitors as specific regulators of particular phosphatase complexes, acting in addition to, not instead of, regulatory subunits. The cellular actions of the endogenous inhibitors are controlled by phosphorylation, connecting them to kinase pathways. More recent progress has unveiled additional functions of PP1 inhibitor-2 (I-2), including regulation of protein kinases. Transcriptional mechanisms govern the expression levels of CPI-17 in response to stimuli. If true for other inhibitor proteins, they have the potential of being diagnostic markers for pathological conditions.

We show that cyclosporine A added to a sample containing NS5BΔ21, NS5A-D2, and CypA specifically inhibits the interaction between CypA and NS5A-D2 without altering the one between NS5A-D2 and NS5BΔ21. A high quality heteronuclear NMR spectrum of HCV NS5BΔ21 has been obtained and was used to characterize the binding site on the polymerase of NS5A-D2. Moreover these data highlight the potential of using NMR of NS5BΔ21 as a powerful tool to characterize in solution the interactions of the HCV polymerase with all kinds of molecules (proteins, inhibitors, RNA). This work brings new insights into the comprehension of the molecular interplay between NS5B, NS5A, and CypA, three essentials proteins for HCV replication.",Hepatitis C Virus;Host-Pathogen Interactions;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance;Protein Domains;Protein-Protein Interactions;Cyclophilin

To remove nt positions 2474-5817 and create a linear fragment with blunt ends from the plasmid pBPY53, a yeast-bacteria shuttle vector containing full-length cDNA of PLRV, the plasmid was digested with 10-fold excess of the enzymes Stu1 (New England Biolabs, site: AGC/CCT) and Bsa1 (New England Biolabs, site GGTCTC(N)1/), in New England Biolabs Buffer 4 (20 mM tris-acetate, 50 mM potassium acetate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 1mM dithiothreitol) containing 100 μg/mL Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) at 37 °C, overnight. After linearization, the long fragment was dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs) to inhibit fragment-end ligation. The short insertion fragments containing the mutation region were PCR-amplified from pBNUP11053 with primers homologous to their junctions (Supplementary Figure 1). The linearized pBYP and the PCR-generated small fragments were mixed with yeast grown on YPD plates (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, 2% agar) for yeast transformation based on the Duplex-A-yeast two hybrid system manual (Origene Thechnologies, Rockville, MD).

We calculate the reduction in the number of backbone conformations upon folding using the distribution of backbone dihedral angles (φ,ψ) obtained from an experimentally validated denatured state model, along with all-atom simulations for both the denatured and native states. The average loss of entropy per residue is TΔSBBU-N = 0.7, 0.9, or 1.1 kcal·mol−1 at T = 298 K, depending on the force field used, with a 0.6 kcal·mol−1 dispersion across the sequence. The average equates to a decrease of a factor of 3–7 in the number of conformations available per residue (f = ΩDenatured/ΩNative) or to a total of ftot=3n–7n for an n residue protein. Our value is smaller than most previous estimates where f = 7–20, i.e., our computed TΔSBBU-N is smaller by 10–100 kcal mol−1 for n=100. The differences emerge from our use of realistic native and denatured state ensembles as well as from the inclusion of accurate local sequence preferences, neighbor effects, and correlated motions (vibrations), in contrast to some previous studies that invoke gross assumptions about the entropy in either or both states. We find that the loss of entropy primarily depends on the local environment and less on properties of the native state, with the exception of α-helical residues in some force fields.",Entropy Loss;Langevin Dynamics;Molecular Dynamics.

We report that all tested secretins from several type II secretion systems and from the filamentous bacteriophage f1 can spontaneously multimerize and insert into liposomes in an in vitro transcription-translation system. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that these secretins form a group distinct from the secretins of the type IV piliation and type III secretion systems, which do not autoassemble in vitro. A mutation causing a proline-to-leucine substitution allowed PilQ secretins from two different type IV piliation systems to assemble in vitro, albeit with very low efficiency, suggesting that autoassembly is an inherent property of all secretins.",

TrfA2 is produced from an internal translational start site within trfA1. While TrfA1 was previously shown to be essential for replication in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, its role in other bacteria within its broad host range has not been established. To address the role of TrfA1 and TrfA2 in other hosts, efficiency of transformation, plasmid copy number (PCN), and plasmid stability were first compared between a mini-IncP-1β plasmid and its trfA1 frameshift variant in four phylogenetically distant hosts: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, Sphingobium japonicum, and Cupriavidus necator. TrfA2 was sufficient for replication in these hosts, but the presence of TrfA1 enhanced transformation efficiency and PCN. However, TrfA1 did not contribute to, and even negatively affected, long-term plasmid persistence. When trfA genes were cloned under a constitutive promoter in the chromosomes of the four hosts, strains expressing either both TrfA1 and TrfA2 or TrfA1 alone, again, generally elicited a higher PCN of an IncP1-β replicon than strains expressing TrfA2 alone. When a single species of TrfA was produced at different concentrations in E. coli cells, TrfA1 maintained a 3- to 4-fold higher PCN than TrfA2 at the same TrfA concentrations, indicating that replication mediated by TrfA1 is more efficient than that by TrfA2. These results suggest that the broad-host-range properties of IncP-1 plasmids are essentially conferred by TrfA2 and the intact replication origin alone but that TrfA1 is nonetheless important to efficiently establish plasmid replication upon transfer into a broad range of hosts.",

These proteinaceous bodies range in form from fibers and intracellular foci—such as those formed by enzymes of nitrogen and carbon utilization and of nucleotide biosynthesis—to high-density packings inside bacterial microcompartments and eukaryotic microbodies. Although many enzymes clearly form functional mega-assemblies, it is not yet clear for many recently discovered cases whether they represent functional entities, storage bodies, or aggregates. In this article, we survey intracellular protein bodies formed by metabolic enzymes, asking when and why such bodies form and what their formation implies for the functionality—and dysfunctionality—of the enzymes that comprise them. The panoply of intracellular protein bodies also raises interesting questions regarding their evolution and maintenance within cells.

One of the classical methodologies to identify such metastable species is the “burst-phase analysis,” whereby the observed signal amplitude from stopped-flow traces is determined as a function of denaturant concentration. However, a complication may arise when folding is sufficiently fast to jeopardize the reliability of the stopped-flow technique. In this study, we reassessed the folding of the KIX domain from cAMP Response Element-Binding (CREB)-binding protein, which has been proposed to involve the formation of an intermediate that accumulates in the dead time of the stopped flow. By using an in-house-built capillary continuous flow with a 50-μs dead time, we demonstrate that this intermediate is not present; the problem arose because of the instrumental limitation of the standard stopped flow to assess very fast refolding rate constants (e.g., ≥500 s−1).",protein folding;kinetics;intermediates;continuous flow

Quadruplex-forming nucleic acids (NAs) have been found to specifically bind to both PrP cellular and pathological isoforms. To clarify the relevance of these interactions, thermodynamic, kinetic and structural studies have been performed, using isothermal titration calorimetry, surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism methodologies. Three quadruplex-forming sequences, d(TGGGGT), r(GGAGGAGGAGGA), d(GGAGGAGGAGGA), and various forms of PrP were selected for this study. Our results showed that these quadruplexes exhibit a high affinity and specificity toward PrP, with KD values within the range 62÷630 nM, and a weaker affinity toward a PrP-β oligomer, which mimics the pathological isoform. We demonstrated that the NA quadruplex architecture is the structural determinant for the recognition by both PrP isoforms. Furthermore, we spotted both PrP N-terminal and C-terminal domains as the binding regions involved in the interaction with DNA/RNAs, using several PrP truncated forms. Interestingly, a reciprocally induced structure loss was observed upon PrP–NA interaction. Our results allowed to surmise a quadruplex unwinding-activity of PrP, that may have a feedback in vivo.",

One important issue regarding the correct usage of FRET is its dependence on the donor-acceptor relative orientation, expressed as the orientation factor κ2. Different donor/acceptor conformations can lead to κ2 values in the 0 ≤ κ2 ≤ 4 range. Because the characteristic distance for FRET, R0, is proportional to (κ2)1/6, uncertainties in the orientation factor are reflected in the quality of information that can be retrieved from a FRET experiment. In most cases, the average value of κ2 corresponding to the dynamic isotropic limit (<κ2> = 2/3) is used for computation of R0 and hence donor-acceptor distances and acceptor concentrations. However, this can lead to significant error in unfavorable cases. This issue is more critical in membrane systems, because of their intrinsically anisotropic nature and their reduced fluidity in comparison to most common solvents. Here, a simple numerical simulation method for estimation of the probability density function of κ2 for membrane-embedded donor and acceptor fluorophores in the dynamic regime is presented. In the simplest form, the proposed procedure uses as input the most probable orientations of the donor and acceptor transition dipoles, obtained by experimental (including linear dichroism) or theoretical (such as molecular dynamics simulation) techniques. Optionally, information about the widths of the donor and/or acceptor angular distributions may be incorporated. The methodology is illustrated for special limiting cases and common membrane FRET pairs.",fluorescence;FRET;kappa-squared;linear dichroism;lipid bilayer;membrane probe;molecular dynamics

Periodontal disease results from the destructive behavior of the host elicited by an infectious biofilm adhering to the tooth root and left untreated, may lead to tooth loss. We describe a novel protocol for identifying peptide sequences from native proteins with the potential to repair damaged dental tissues by controlling hydroxyapatite biomineralization. Using amelogenin as a case study and a bioinformatics scoring matrix, we identified regions within amelogenin that are shared with a set of hydroxyapatite-binding peptides (HABPs) previously selected by phage display. One 22-amino acid long peptide regions referred to as amelogenin-derived peptide 5 (ADP5) was shown to facilitate cell-free formation of a cementum-like hydroxyapatite mineral layer on demineralized human root dentin that, in turn, supported attachment of periodontal ligament cells in vitro. Our findings have several implications in peptide-assisted mineral formation that mimic biomineralization. By further elaborating the mechanism for protein control over the biomineral formed, we afford new insights into the evolution of protein–mineral interactions. By exploiting small peptide domains of native proteins, our understanding of structure–function relationships of biomineralizing proteins can be extended and these peptides can be utilized to engineer mineral formation. Finally, the cementomimetic layer formed by ADP5 has the potential clinical application to repair diseased root surfaces so as to promote the regeneration of periodontal tissues and thereby reduce the morbidity associated with tooth loss.",amelogenin;amelogenin-derived peptides;bioinformatics;biomineralization;cementomimetics;cementum;demineralization;remineralization

The structure shows that the compound binds to the MLL pocket in menin and mimics the key interactions of MLL with menin. Based on the menin–MI-2 structure, we developed MI-2-2, a compound that binds to menin with low nanomolar affinity (Kd = 22nM) and very effectively disrupts the bivalent protein-protein interaction between menin and MLL. MI-2-2 demonstrated specific and very pronounced activity in MLL leukemia cells, including inhibition of cell proliferation, down-regulation of Hoxa9 expression, and differentiation. Our results provide the rational and essential structural basis to design next generation of inhibitors for effective targeting of the menin-MLL interaction in leukemia and demonstrate a proof of concept that inhibition of complex multivalent protein-protein interactions can be achieved by a small-molecule inhibitor.",

TolA is central to this network linking the inner and outer membranes by interactions with TolQ, TolR, TolB, and Pal. Group A colicins, such as ColA, parasitize the Tol network through interactions with TolA and/or TolB to facilitate translocation through the cell envelope to reach their cytotoxic site of action. We have determined the first structure of the C-terminal domain of TolA (TolAIII) bound to an N-terminal ColA polypeptide (TA53–107). The interface region of the TA53–107-TolAIII complex consists of polar contacts linking residues Arg-92 to Arg-96 of ColA with residues Leu-375–Pro-380 of TolA, which constitutes a β-strand addition commonly seen in more promiscuous protein-protein contacts. The interface region also includes three cation-π interactions (Tyr-58–Lys-368, Tyr-90–Lys-379, Phe-94–Lys-396), which have not been observed in any other colicin-Tol protein complex. Mutagenesis of the interface residues of ColA or TolA revealed that the effect on the interaction was cumulative; single mutations of either partner had no effect on ColA activity, whereas mutations of three or more residues significantly reduced ColA activity. Mutagenesis of the aromatic ring component of the cation-π interacting residues showed Tyr-58 of ColA to be essential for the stability of complex formation. TA53–107 binds on the opposite side of TolAIII to that used by g3p, ColN, or TolB, illustrating the flexible nature of TolA as a periplasmic hub protein.",Bacterial Toxins;Microbiology;Protein Structure;Protein-Protein Interactions;X-ray Crystallography;Tol;Bacteriocin;Colicin

Reduced or absent α-DG immunolabeling in muscle biopsies were identified in all three patients. Bioinformatic tools were used to study the potential effect of POMT1-detected mutations. All the detected POMT1 mutations were predicted in silico to interfere with protein folding and/or glycosyltransferase function.

A defining feature of apoptosis in all cells is the apoptotic volume decrease or AVD, which has been considered a passive component of the cell death process. Most cells have inherent volume regulatory increase (RVI) mechanisms to contest an imposed loss in cell size, however T-cells are unique in that they do not have a RVI response. We utilized this property to explore potential regulatory roles of a RVI response in apoptosis. Exposure of immature T-cells to hyperosmotic stress resulted in a rapid, synchronous, and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Multiple rounds of osmotic stress followed by recovery of cells in normal media resulted in the development of a population of cells that were resistant to osmotic stress induced apoptosis. These cells were also resistant to other apoptotic stimuli that activate via the intrinsic cell death pathway, while remaining sensitive to extrinsic apoptotic stimuli. Interestingly, these osmotic stress resistant cells showed no increase in anti-apoptotic proteins, and released cytochrome c from their mitochondria following exposure to intrinsic apoptotic stimuli. The osmotic stress resistant cells developed a RVI response, and inhibition of the RVI restored sensitivity to apoptotic agents. Analysis of apoptotic signaling pathways showed a sustained increase in phospho-AKT, whose inhibition also prevented an RVI response resulting in apoptosis. These results define a critical role of volume regulation mechanisms in apoptotic resistance.",Apoptosis;Cell Death;Flow Cytometry;Lymphocyte;Stress Response;Cell Volume Regulation;Osmotic Stress;Regulatory Volume Increase

Changes in its conformation and permeability, induced by voltage or apoptosis-related proteins, have been implicated in apoptotic pathways. The three-dimensional structure of VDAC has recently been determined as a 19-stranded β-barrel with an in-lying N-terminal helix. However, its mechanism of gating is a matter of ongoing debate. Using solid-state NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and electrophysiology, we show that deletion of the rigid N-terminal helix sharply increases overall motion in VDAC’s β-barrel frame, resulting in elliptic, semi-collapsed shapes of the β–barrel. These states quantitatively reproduce conductance and selectivity of the closed VDAC conformation. Mutation of the N-terminal helix leads to a phenotype intermediate to the open wild-type and the closed channel. These data suggest that the N-terminal helix controls entry into elliptic β-barrel states which form the structural basis for the closed state of VDAC. Our results also indicate that β-barrel channels are intrinsically flexible and imply mechanosensitivity of VDAC channels.",VDAC;membrane protein;gating;solid-state NMR;molecular dynamics

Erythrocyte adherence is directly associated with severe malaria and increased disease lethality, and it is mediated by the PfEMP1 family. PfEMP1 clustering in knob-like protrusions on the erythrocyte membrane is critical for cytoadherence, however the molecular mechanisms behind this system remain elusive. Here, we show that the intracellular domains of the PfEMP1 family (ATS) share a unique molecular architecture, which comprises a minimal folded core and extensive flexible elements. A conserved flexible segment at the ATS center is minimally restrained by the folded core. Yeast-two-hybrid data and a novel sequence analysis method suggest that this central segment contains a conserved protein interaction epitope. Interestingly, ATS in solution fails to bind the parasite knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP), an essential cytoadherence component. Instead, we demonstrate that ATS associates with PFI1780w, a member of the Plasmodium helical interspersed sub-telomeric (PHIST) family. PHIST domains are widespread in exported parasite proteins, however this is the first specific molecular function assigned to any variant of this family. We propose that PHIST domains facilitate protein interactions, and that the conserved ATS epitope may be targeted to disrupt the parasite cytoadherence system.",Biophysics;Malaria;NMR;Plasmodium;Protein Structure;ATS;KAHRP;Malaria Cytoadherence;PHIST;PfEMP1

E proteins are basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors that modulate lymphoid versus myeloid cell fate decisions. To study the role of E proteins in osteoclasts, myeloid specific E protein gain-of-function transgenic mice were generated. These mice have high bone mass due to decreased osteoclast numbers and increased osteoclast apoptosis leading to overall reductions in resorptive capacity. The molecular mechanism of decreased osteoclast numbers and resorption is due, in part, to elevated expression of CD38, a regulator of intracellular calcium pools with known anti-osteoclastogenic properties, which increases sensitivity to apoptosis. In vivo, exogenous RANKL stimulation can overcome this inhibition to drive osteoclastogenesis and bone loss. In vitro derived ET2 osteoclasts are more spread and more numerous with increases in RANK, TREM2, and NFATc1 compared to wild type. However, their resorptive capacity does not increase accordingly. Thus, E proteins participate in osteoclast maturation and survival in homeostatic bone remodeling.",Osteoclast;E proteins;CD38;transcription factor

In lamellipodia, CP dissociates from the actin cytoskeleton rapidly, suggesting the possible existence of an uncapping factor, for which the protein CARMIL (capping protein, Arp2/3 and myosin-I
linker) is a candidate. CARMIL binds to CP via two motifs. One, the CP interaction (CPI) motif, is found in a number of unrelated proteins; the other motif is unique to CARMILs, the CARMIL-specific interaction motif. A 115-aa CARMIL fragment of CARMIL with both motifs, termed the CP-binding region (CBR), binds to CP with high affinity, inhibits capping, and causes uncapping. We wanted to understand the structural basis for this function. We used a collection of mutants affecting the actin-binding surface of CP to test the possibility of a steric-blocking model, which remained open because a region of CBR was not resolved in the CBR/CP co-crystal structure. The CP actin-binding mutants bound CBR normally. In addition, a CBR mutant with all residues of the unresolved region changed showed nearly normal binding to CP. Having ruled out a steric blocking model, we tested an allosteric model with molecular dynamics. We found that CBR binding induces changes in the conformation of the actin-binding surface of CP. In addition, ∼30-aa truncations on the actin-binding surface of CP decreased the affinity of CBR for CP. Thus, CARMIL promotes uncapping by binding to a freely accessible site on CP bound to a filament barbed end and inducing a change in the conformation of the actin-binding surface of CP.",Actin;Allosteric Regulation;Cytoskeleton;Molecular Dynamics;Site-directed Mutagenesis;CARMIL;Capping Protein

The analysis of protein dynamics relies on biophysical techniques that can distinguish simultaneously existing populations of molecules and their rates of interconversion. Hydrogen exchange (HX) detected by mass spectrometry (MS) is contributing to our understanding of protein motions by revealing unfolding and dynamics on a wide timescale, ranging from seconds to hours to days. In this review we discuss HX MS-based analyses of protein dynamics, using our studies of multi-domain kinases as examples. Using HX MS, we have successfully probed protein dynamics and unfolding in the isolated SH3, SH2 and kinase domains of the c-Src and Abl kinase families, as well as the role of inter- and intra-molecular interactions in the global control of kinase function. Coupled with high-resolution structural information, HX MS has proved to be a powerful and versatile tool for the analysis of the conformational dynamics in these kinase systems, and has provided fresh insight regarding the regulatory control of these important signaling proteins. HX MS studies of dynamics are applicable not only to the proteins we illustrate here, but to a very wide range of proteins and protein systems, and should play a role in both classification of and greater understanding of the prevalence of protein motion.",Src-family kinase;Hck;Lck;SH3 domain;SH2 domain;Abl;deuterium;HDX;protein dynamics;flexibility

Full-length UmuD inhibits DNA replication and prevents mutagenic TLS, while the cleaved form UmuD′ facilitates mutagenesis. We show that α possesses two UmuD binding sites: at the N-terminus (residues 1–280) and the C-terminus (residues 956–975). The C-terminal site favors UmuD over UmuD′.

Ten TA loci of Escherichia coli K-12 encode mRNases that cumulatively contribute to persistence (multidrug tolerance) of the bacterial cells. The mechanisms underlying induction and reversion of the persistent state are not yet understood. The vapBC operon of Salmonalla enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 encodes VapC, a tRNase that reversibly inhibits translation by site-specific cleavage of tRNAfMet. VapB is an antitoxin that interacts with and neutralizes VapC via its C-terminal tail and regulate TA operon transcription via its N-terminal DNA binding domain that recognize operators in the vapBC promoter region. We show here that transcription of the vapBC operon of S. enterica is controlled by a recently discovered regulatory theme referred to as ‘conditional cooperativity’: at low T/A ratios, the TA complex binds cooperatively to the promoter region and represses TA operon transcription whereas at high T/A ratios, the excess toxin leads to destabilization of the TA-operator complex and therefore, induction of transcription. We present evidence that an excess of VapC toxin leads to operator complex destabilization by breaking of toxin dimers.",

Among this group of molecules, members of the SCIN and Efb families of complement inhibitors have been the subject of particularly intense study. This work has demonstrated that both types of proteins exert their primary function by inhibiting C3 convertases, which lie at the heart of the complement-mediated immune response. Despite this similarity, however, significant differences in structure/function relationships and mechanisms of action exist between these bacterial proteins. Furthermore, divergent secondary effects on host immune responses have also been described for these two protein families.

Natively unfolded in solution, αS accumulates as amyloid in neurological tissue in Parkinson disease and interacts with membranes under both physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we used cryoelectron microscopy in conjunction with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and other techniques to characterize the ability of αS to remodel vesicles. At molar ratios of 1:5 to 1:40 for protein/lipid (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol), large spherical vesicles are converted into cylindrical micelles ∼50 Å in diameter. Other lipids of the same charge (negative) exhibit generally similar behavior, although bilayer tubes of 150–500 Å in width are also produced, depending on the lipid acyl chains. At higher protein/lipid ratios, discoid particles, 70–100 Å across, are formed. EPR data show that, on cylindrical micelles, αS adopts an extended amphipathic α-helical conformation, with its long axis aligned with the tube axis. The observed geometrical relationship between αS and the micelle suggests that the wedging of its long α-helix into the outer leaflet of a membrane may cause curvature and an anisotropic partition of lipids, leading to tube formation.",α-Synuclein;Lipids;Membrane Biophysics;Membrane Proteins;Membrane Structure;Circular Dichroism;Conformational Change;Cryoelectron Microscopy;Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Protein-Lipid Interactions

Similar to an established glycosylated ERAD substrate, the uncleaved precursor of asialoglycoprotein receptor H2a, its nonglycosylated mutant, makes use of calnexin, EDEM1, and HRD1, but only glycosylated H2a is a substrate for the cytosolic SCFFbs2 E3 ubiquitin ligase with lectin activity.

EDEM1 associates through a region outside of its mannosidase-like domain with the nonglycosylated proteins. Similar to glycosylated substrates, proteasomal inhibition induced accumulation of the nonglycosylated proteins and ERAD machinery in the endoplasmic reticulum-derived quality control compartment.

The architectures of the complex membrane-spanning secretion apparatuses of both systems are similar, but they are associated with different extracellular appendages, including the flagellar hook and filament or the needle/pilus structures of translocation-associated T3S systems. The needle/pilus is connected to a bacterial translocon that is inserted into the host plasma membrane and mediates the transkingdom transport of bacterial effector proteins into eukaryotic cells. During the last 3 to 5 years, significant progress has been made in the characterization of membrane-associated core components and extracellular structures of T3S systems. Furthermore, transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulators that control T3S gene expression and substrate specificity have been described. Given the architecture of the T3S system, it is assumed that extracellular components of the secretion apparatus are secreted prior to effector proteins, suggesting that there is a hierarchy in T3S. The aim of this review is to summarize our current knowledge of T3S system components and associated control proteins from both plant- and animal-pathogenic bacteria.",

Reverse transcriptase (RT) has previously been shown to function as a molecular motor, dismantling the nucleocapsid complex that binds the viral genome as soon as plus-strand DNA synthesis initiates. We first propose a detailed model of this dismantling in close relationship with the sequential conversion from RNA to double-stranded (ds) DNA, focusing on the nucleocapsid protein (NCp7). The HIV-1 DNA-containing preintegration complex (PIC) resulting from completion of reverse transcription is translocated through the nuclear pore. The PIC nucleoprotein architecture is poorly understood but contains at least two HIV-1 proteins initially from the virion core, namely Integrase (IN) and the viral protein r (Vpr). We next present a set of electron micrographs supporting that Vpr behaves as a DNA architectural protein, initiating multiple DNA bridges over more than 500 base pairs (bp). These complexes are shown to interact with NCp7 bound to single-stranded nucleic acid regions that are thought to maintain IN binding during dsDNA synthesis, concurrently with nucleocapsid complex dismantling. This unexpected binding of Vpr conveniently leads to a compacted but filamentous folding of the vDNA that should favor its nuclear import. Finally, nucleocapsid-like aggregates engaged in dsDNA synthesis appear to efficiently bind to F-actin filaments, a property that may be involved in targeting complexes to the nuclear envelope. More generally, this article highlights unique possibilities offered by in vitro reconstitution approaches combined with macromolecular imaging to gain insights into the mechanisms that alter the nucleoprotein architecture of the HIV-1 genome, ultimately enabling its insertion into the nuclear chromatin.",HIV-1;nucleocapsid;Viral protein r;reverse transcription;pre-integration complex;integrase

Twelve publicly available phosphoproteome data sets were triaged to obtain a subset of high-confidence phosphorylation sites (p-sites), free of “noisy” phosphorylations. Analysis of this combined data set suggests that the inventory of phosphoproteins in yeast is close to completion, but that these proteins may have many undiscovered p-sites. Proteins involved in budding and protein kinase activity have high numbers of p-sites and are highly over-represented in the vast majority of the yeast phosphoproteome data sets. The yeast phosphoproteome is characterized by a few proteins with many p-sites and many proteins with a few p-sites. We confirm a tendency for p-sites to cluster together and find evidence that kinases may phosphorylate off-target amino acids that are within one or two residues of their cognate target. This suggests that the precise position of the phosphorylated amino acid is not a stringent requirement for regulatory fidelity. Compared with nonphosphorylated proteins, phosphoproteins are more ancient, more abundant, have longer unstructured regions, have more genetic interactions, more protein interactions, and are under tighter post-translational regulation. It appears that phosphoproteins constitute the raw material for pathway rewiring and adaptation at various evolutionary rates.",

The exact mechanism behind this interplay of protein binding and membrane curvature has not yet been properly understood. To improve understanding of the mechanism, we study curvature sorting of proteins in a model system consisting of a tether pulled from a giant unilamellar vesicle using mechanical-thermodynamic models. The concentration of proteins bound to the membrane changes significantly due to curvature. This has also been observed in experiments by other researchers. We also find that there is a phase transition based on protein concentration and we discuss the coexistence of phases and stability of solutions. Furthermore, when sorting is favorable, the increase in protein concentration stabilizes the tether in the sense that less pulling force is required to maintain the tether. A similar mechanism may be in place, when motor proteins pull tethers from donor membranes.",

We have determined here a number of distinct functional differences between the major 18.5-kDa and minor 21.5-kDa isoforms of classic MBP with respect to oligodendrocyte (OLG) proliferation. We have found that, in contrast to 18.5-kDa MBP, 21.5-kDa MBP increases proliferation of early developmental immortalized N19-OLGs by elevating the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and Akt1 kinases and of ribosomal protein S6. Coculture of N2a neuronal cells with N19-OLGs transfected with the 21.5-kDa isoform (or conditioned medium from), but not the 18.5-kDa isoform, caused the N2a cells to have increased neurite outgrowth and process branching complexity. These roles were dependent on subcellular localization of 21.5-kDa MBP to the nucleus and on the exon II-encoded segment, suggesting that the nuclear localization of early minor isoforms of MBP may play a crucial role in regulating and/or initiating myelin and neuronal development in the mammalian CNS.",myelin basic protein;MBP;oligodendrocytes;myelination;live-cell imaging

","Purkinje cell protein 4-like 1 (Pcp4l1) is a small neuronal IQ motif protein closely related to the calmodulin binding protein Pcp4/PEP-19. PEP-19 interacts with calmodulin via its IQ motif to inhibit calmodulin-dependent enzymes and we hypothesized Pcp4l1 would have similar properties. Surprisingly, full length Pcp4l1 does not interact with calmodulin in yeast two-hybrid or pulldown experiments yet a synthetic peptide constituting only the IQ motif of Pcp4l1 binds calmodulin and inhibits calmodulin-dependent kinase II. A nine-residue glutamic acid rich sequence in Pcp4l1 confers these unexpected properties. This element lies outside the IQ motif and its deletion or exchange with the homologous region of PEP-19 restores calmodulin binding. Conversion of a single isoleucine (Ile36) within this motif to phenylalanine, the residue present in PEP-19, imparts calmodulin binding onto Pcp4l1. Moreover, only aromatic amino acid substitutions at position 36 in Pcp4l1 allow binding. Thus, despite their sequence similarities PEP-19 and Pcp4l1 have distinct properties with the latter harboring an element that can functionally suppress an IQ motif. We speculate Pcp4l1 may be a latent calmodulin inhibitor regulated by post-translational modification and/or co-factor interactions.",Calmodulin;Calcium;IQ motif;Pcp4l1;PEP-19

The core subunit of the BAM complex is BamA and, in Escherichia coli, four lipoprotein subunits: BamB, BamC, BamD and BamE, also function in the BAM complex. Hidden Markov model analysis was used to comprehensively assess the distribution of subunits of the BAM lipoproteins across all subclasses of proteobacteria. A patchwork distribution was detected which is readily reconciled with the evolution of the α-, β-, γ-, δ- and ε-proteobacteria. Our findings lead to a proposal that the ancestral BAM complex was composed of two subunits: BamA and BamD, and that BamB, BamC and BamE evolved later in a distinct sequence of events. Furthermore, in some lineages novel lipoproteins have evolved instead of the lipoproteins found in E. coli. As an example of this concept, we show that no known species of α-proteobacteria has a homologue of BamC. However, purification of the BAM complex from the model α-proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus identified a novel subunit we refer to as BamF, which has a conserved sequence motif related to sequences found in BamC. BamF and BamD can be eluted from the BAM complex under similar conditions, mirroring the BamC:D module seen in the BAM complex of γ-proteobacteria such as E. coli.",

These complex sensorimotor tasks depend on the dynamic interplay between numerous cellular building blocks that consist of voltage-, calcium-, and ATP-dependent ionic conductances, various ionotropic and metabotropic synaptic mechanisms, as well as neuromodulators acting on G-protein coupled receptors and second messenger systems. As described in this review, the sensorimotor responses of the respiratory network emerge through the state-dependent integration of all these building blocks. There is no known respiratory function that involves only a small number of intrinsic, synaptic, or modulatory properties. Because of the complex integration of numerous intrinsic, synaptic, and modulatory mechanisms, the respiratory network is capable of continuously adapting to changes in the external and internal environment, which makes breathing one of the most integrated behaviors. Not surprisingly, inspiration is critical not only in the control of ventilation, but also in the context of “inspiring behaviors” such as arousal of the mind and even creativity. Far-reaching implications apply also to the underlying network mechanisms, as lessons learned from the respiratory network apply to network functions in general.",

Atg12–Atg5 conjugate functions as an E3-like enzyme to promote lipidation of Atg8,
whereas lipidated Atg8 has essential roles in both autophagosome formation and selective
cargo recognition during autophagy. However, the molecular role of Atg12 modification in
these processes has remained elusive. Here, we report the crystal structure of the
Atg12–Atg5 conjugate. In addition to the isopeptide linkage, Atg12 forms hydrophobic
and hydrophilic interactions with Atg5, thereby fixing its position on Atg5. Structural
comparison with unmodified Atg5 and mutational analyses showed that Atg12 modification
neither induces a conformational change in Atg5 nor creates a functionally important
architecture. Rather, Atg12 functions as a binding module for Atg3, the E2 enzyme for Atg8,
thus endowing Atg5 with the ability to interact with Atg3 to facilitate Atg8 lipidation.",autophagy;Atg12;Atg5;Atg3;crystal structure

There are several large gene families that function in immunity in this species including the Sp185/333 gene family that has ∼50 (±10) members. The family shows intriguing sequence diversity and encodes a broad array of diverse yet similar proteins. The genes have two exons of which the second encodes the mature protein and has repeats and blocks of sequence called elements. Mosaics of element patterns plus single nucleotide polymorphisms-based variants of the elements result in significant sequence diversity among the genes yet maintains similar structure among the members of the family. Sequence of a bacterial artificial chromosome insert shows a cluster of six, tightly linked Sp185/333 genes that are flanked by GA microsatellites. The sequences between the GA microsatellites in which the Sp185/333 genes and flanking regions are located, are much more similar to each other than are the sequences outside the microsatellites suggesting processes such as gene conversion, recombination, or duplication. However, close linkage does not correspond with greater sequence similarity compared to randomly cloned and sequenced genes that are unlikely to be linked. There are three segmental duplications that are bounded by GAT microsatellites and include three almost identical genes plus flanking regions. RNA editing is detectible throughout the mRNAs based on comparisons to the genes, which, in combination with putative post-translational modifications to the proteins, results in broad arrays of Sp185/333 proteins that differ among individuals. The mature proteins have an N-terminal glycine-rich region, a central RGD motif, and a C-terminal histidine-rich region. The Sp185/333 proteins are localized to the cell surface and are found within vesicles in subsets of polygonal and small phagocytes. The coelomocyte proteome shows full-length and truncated proteins, including some with missense sequence. Current results suggest that both native Sp185/333 proteins and a recombinant protein bind bacteria and are likely important in sea urchin innate immunity.",echinoid;invertebrate;evolution;innate immunity;coelomocyte;microsatellites;RNA editing;gene family

The mobility of loops is central for the motional freedom and flexibility requirements of active-site loops and may play a critical role for some functions. The structures and behaviors of loops have not been much studied in the context of the whole structure and its overall motions, and especially how these might be coupled. Here we investigate loop motions by using coarse-grained structures (Cα atoms only) to solve for the motions of the system by applying Lagrange equations with elastic network models to learn about which loops move in an independent fashion and which move in coordination with domain motions, faster and slower, respectively. The normal modes of the system are calculated using eigen-decomposition of the stiffness matrix. The contribution of individual modes and groups of modes are investigated for their effects on all residues in each loop by using Fourier analyses. Our results indicate overall that the motions of functional sets of loops behave in similar ways as the whole structure. But, overall only a relatively few loops move in coordination with the dominant slow modes of motion, and that these are often closely related to function.",

DNA non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) represent the two major DSB repair pathways, and both processes are now well understood. Recent work has demonstrated that the chromatin environment at a DSB significantly impacts upon DSB repair and that, moreover, dramatic modifications arise in the chromatin surrounding a DSB. Chromatin is broadly divided into open, transcriptionally active, euchromatin (EC) and highly compacted, transcriptionally inert, heterochromatin (HC), although these represent extremes of a spectrum. The HC superstructure restricts both DSB repair and damage response signaling. Moreover, DSBs within HC (HC-DSBs) are rapidly relocalized to the EC-HC interface. The damage response protein kinase, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), is required for HC-DSB repair but is dispensable for the relocalization of HC-DSBs. It has been proposed that ATM signaling enhances HC relaxation in the DSB vicinity and that this is a prerequisite for HC-DSB repair. Hence, ATM is essential for repair of HC-DSBs. Here, we discuss how HC impacts upon the response to DSBs and how ATM overcomes the barrier that HC poses to repair.",DNA non-homologous end-joining;chromatin;heterochromatin;damage response signaling;ataxia telangiectasia mutated;homologous recombination

Here, we have found that, in combination with an enhancing effect of ultrasonication on nucleation, β2-microglobulin, a protein responsible for dialysis-related amyloidosis, generates distinct fibril conformations in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE). Although the newly formed fibrils all exhibited a similar needle-like morphology with an extensive cross-β core, as suggested by Fourier transform infrared absorption spectra, they differed in thioflavin T intensity, extension kinetics, and tryptophan fluorescence spectra even in the same solvents, representing polymorphic structures. The hydrophobic residues seemed to be more exposed in the fibrils originating at higher concentrations of TFE, as indicated by the increased binding of 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid, suggesting that the modulation of hydrophobic interactions is critical to the production of polymorphic amyloid structures. Interestingly, the fibrils formed at higher TFE concentrations showed significantly higher stability against guanidium hydrochloride, the perturbation of ionic strength, and, furthermore, pressurization. The cross-β structure inside the fibrils seems to have been more idealized, resulting in increased stability when nucleation occurred in the presence of the alcohol, indicating that a weaker contribution of hydrophobic interactions is intrinsically more amenable to the formation of a non-defective amyloid structure.",Alcohol;Amyloid;Protein Aggregation;Protein Misfolding;Protein Structure;β2-microglobulin;Polymorphism;Ultrasonication

To date, different microcompartments carrying out three distinct types of metabolic processes have been characterized experimentally in various bacteria. In the present work, we use comparative genomics to explore the existence of yet uncharacterized microcompartments encapsulating a broader set of metabolic pathways. A clustering approach was used to group together enzymes that show a strong tendency to be encoded in chromosomal proximity to each other while also being near genes for microcompartment shell proteins. The results uncover new types of putative microcompartments, including one that appears to encapsulate B12-independent, glycyl radical-based degradation of 1,2-propanediol, and another potentially involved in amino alcohol metabolism in mycobacteria. Preliminary experiments show that an unusual shell protein encoded within the glycyl radical-based microcompartment binds an iron-sulfur cluster, hinting at complex mechanisms in this uncharacterized system. In addition, an examination of the computed microcompartment clusters suggests the existence of specific functional variations within certain types of MCPs, including the alpha carboxysome and the glycyl radical-based microcompartment.

We address this question using cell free replication of chromatin. Previously, we showed that a Polycomb Group complex, PRC1, remains continuously associated with chromatin through DNA replication. Here we investigate the mechanism of persistence. We find that a single PRC1 subunit, Posterior Sex Combs (PSC) can reconstitute persistence through DNA replication. PSC binds nucleosomes and self-interacts, bridging nucleosomes into a stable, oligomeric structure. Within these structures, individual PSC-chromatin contacts are dynamic. Stable association of PSC with chromatin, including through DNA replication, depends on PSC-PSC interactions. Our data suggest labile individual PSC-chromatin contacts allow passage of the DNA replication machinery while PSC-PSC interactions prevent PSC from dissociating, allowing it to rebind to replicated chromatin. This mechanism may allow inheritance of chromatin proteins including PRC1 through DNA replication to maintain chromatin states.",chromatin;DNA replication;Polycomb;epigenetic;cell free system

Here, we demonstrate the existence of a non-canonical mechanism for NKX3.1 turnover that does not require ubiquitination. Using a structure-function approach, we have determined that the conserved, C-terminal 21-amino acid domain of NKX3.1 (C21) is required for this novel ubiquitin-independent degradation mechanism. Addition of C21 decreased half-life of enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) by 5-fold, demonstrating that C21 constitutes a portable degron. Point mutational analyses of C21 revealed that a conserved proline residue (Pro-221) is central to degron activity, and mutation to alanine (P221A) increased NKX3.1 half-life >2-fold. Proteasome inhibition and in vivo ubiquitination analyses indicated that degron activity is ubiquitin-independent. Evaluating degron activity in the context of a ubiquitination-resistant, lysine-null NKX3.1 mutant (NKX3.1KO) confirmed that P221A mutation conferred additional stability to NKX3.1.

Mutations in the RDS gene have been identified in a variety of human retinal degenerative diseases and more than 70% of these mutations are located in the second intradiscal (D2) loop, highlighting the importance of this region. Here we examined conformational and thermal stability properties of the D2 loop of RDS, as well as interactions with RDS’ non-glycosylated homologue ROM-1. The RDS D2 loop was expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein with maltose binding protein (MBP). The fusion protein, referred to as MBP-D2, was purified to homogeneity. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy showed that the wild-type (WT) D2 loop consists of ~21% α-helix, ~20% β-sheet and ~59% random coil. D2 loop fusion proteins carrying disease-causing mutations in RDS (e.g R172W, C214S, N244H/K) were also examined, and conformational changes were observed (compared to WT D2). In particular, C150S, C214S, and N244H showed significant reductions in the α-helicity. Nevertheless, the thermal stability of the mutants was unchanged compared to WT, and all mutants were all capable of interacting with ROM-1, indicating that this functional aspect of the isolated D2 loop remained intact in the mutants despite the observed conformational changes. An I-TASSER model of the RDS D2 loop predicted structure consistent with the CD experiments and with the structure of the conserved region of the D2 loop of other tetraspanin family members.

However, these structures lack information about poorly ordered termini, and the energetic contributions of specific protein–DNA contacts cannot be inferred. Furthermore, these structures do not reveal how DNA repair intermediates are passed between enzyme active sites. We used a functional footprinting approach to define the binding sites of the first two enzymes of the human BER pathway for the repair of deaminated purines, alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (AAG) and AP endonuclease (APE1). Although the functional footprint for full-length AAG is explained by crystal structures of truncated AAG, the footprint for full-length APE1 indicates a much larger binding site than is observed in crystal structures. AAG turnover is stimulated in the presence of APE1, indicating rapid exchange of AAG and APE1 at the abasic site produced by the AAG reaction. The coordinated reaction does not require an extended footprint, suggesting that each enzyme engages the site independently. Functional footprinting provides unique information relative to traditional footprinting approaches and is generally applicable to any DNA modifying enzyme or system of enzymes.",

To gain insight into the molecular functions of synucleins, we performed an unbiased proteomic screen and identified synaptic protein changes in αβγ-synuclein knock-out brains. We observed increases in the levels of select membrane curvature sensing/generating proteins. One of the most prominent changes was for the N-BAR protein endophilin A1. Here we demonstrate that the levels of synucleins and endophilin A1 are reciprocally regulated and that they are functionally related. We show that all synucleins can robustly generate membrane curvature similar to endophilins. However, only monomeric but not tetrameric α-synuclein can bend membranes. Further, A30P α-synuclein, a Parkinson disease mutant that disrupts protein folding, is also deficient in this activity. This suggests that synucleins generate membrane curvature through the asymmetric insertion of their N-terminal amphipathic helix. Based on our findings, we propose to include synucleins in the class of amphipathic helix-containing proteins that sense and generate membrane curvature. These results advance our understanding of the physiological function of synucleins.",Amphipathic Helix;Exo-Endo Coupling;Parkinson Disease;Synaptic Vesicle Endocytosis

Clb5 is not essential for mitotic proliferation because Clb1–Clb4 can support DNA replication in clb5clb6 mutants. Clb1, Clb3, and Clb4 accumulate in clb5clb6 cells during meiotic differentiation yet fail to promote premeiotic DNA replication. When expressed under the regulation of the CLB5 promoter, Clb1 and Clb3 accumulate and are active in the early stages of meiotic differentiation but cannot induce premeiotic DNA replication, suggesting that they do not target Cdk1 to the necessary substrates. The Clb5 hydrophobic patch (HP) residues are important for Clb5 function but this motif alone does not provide the specificity required for Clb5 to induce premeiotic S phase. Domain exchange experiments demonstrated that the amino terminus of Clb5 when fused to Clb3 confers upon Clb3 the ability to induce premeiotic S phase. Chimeric cyclins containing smaller regions of the Clb5 amino terminus displayed reduced ability to activate premeiotic DNA replication despite being more abundant and having greater associated histone H1 kinase activity than endogenous Clb5. These observations suggest that Clb5 has a unique ability to trigger premeiotic S phase and that the amino-terminal region of Clb5 contributes to its specificity and regulates the functions performed by the cyclin–Cdk complex.",

SH2 domains and protein-tyrosine phosphatases expand alongside protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) to coordinate cellular and organismal complexity in the evolution of the unikont branch of the eukaryotes. Examination of conserved families of PTKs and SH2 domain proteins provides fiduciary marks that trace the evolutionary landscape for the development of complex cellular systems in the proto-metazoan and metazoan lineages. The evolutionary provenance of conserved SH2 and PTK families reveals the mechanisms by which diversity is achieved through adaptations in tissue-specific gene transcription, altered ligand binding, insertions of linear motifs and the gain or loss of domains following gene duplication. We discuss mechanisms by which pTyr-mediated signalling networks evolve through the development of novel and expanded families of SH2 domain proteins and the elaboration of connections between pTyr-signalling proteins. These changes underlie the variety of general and specific signalling networks that give rise to tissue-specific functions and increasingly complex developmental programmes. Examination of SH2 domains from an evolutionary perspective provides insight into the process by which evolutionary expansion and modification of molecular protein interaction domain proteins permits the development of novel protein-interaction networks and accommodates adaptation of signalling networks.",SH2;protein-tyrosine kinase;eukaryotes;phosphotyrosine

The lineage-specific transcription factor Foxp3 orchestrates the development and function of regulatory T cells underlying this immunological tolerance. Despite the crucial role of Foxp3 in supporting immune homeostasis, little is known about its origin, evolution, and species conservation. We explore these questions using comparative genomics, structural modeling, and functional analyses. Our data reveal that key gain-of-function events occurred during the evolution of Foxp3 in higher vertebrates. We identify key conserved residues in its forkhead domain and show a detailed analysis of the N-terminal region of Foxp3, which is only conserved in mammals. These components are under purifying selection, and our mutational analyses demonstrate that they are essential for Foxp3 function. Our study points to critical functional adaptations in immune tolerance among higher vertebrates, and suggests that Foxp3-mediated transcriptional mechanisms emerged during mammalian evolution as a stepwise gain of functional domains that enabled Foxp3 to interact with a multitude of interaction partners.",regulatory T cell;Foxp3;evolution of immune system;lineage commitment;comparative genomics

Moreover, the auxin response pattern, as determined using the synthetic auxin-responsive reporter ProDR5:GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN, was shifted in the basal embryo and suspensor but does not support a strong direct link to auxin response.

Wakefulness promoting systems cause low-voltage, fast activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Multiple interacting neurotransmitter systems in the brain stem, hypothalamus, and basal forebrain converge onto common effector systems in the thalamus and cortex. Sleep results from the inhibition of wake-promoting systems by homeostatic sleep factors such as adenosine and nitric oxide and GABAergic neurons in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus, resulting in large-amplitude, slow EEG oscillations. Local, activity-dependent factors modulate the amplitude and frequency of cortical slow oscillations. Non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep results in conservation of brain energy and facilitates memory consolidation through the modulation of synaptic weights. Rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep results from the interaction of brain stem cholinergic, aminergic, and GABAergic neurons which control the activity of glutamatergic reticular formation neurons leading to REM sleep phenomena such as muscle atonia, REMs, dreaming, and cortical activation. Strong activation of limbic regions during REM sleep suggests a role in regulation of emotion. Genetic studies suggest that brain mechanisms controlling waking and NREM sleep are strongly conserved throughout evolution, underscoring their enormous importance for brain function. Sleep disruption interferes with the normal restorative functions of NREM and REM sleep, resulting in disruptions of breathing and cardiovascular function, changes in emotional reactivity, and cognitive impairments in attention, memory, and decision making.",

A newly discovered subfamily of TRAP-Ts (TPATs) has four components. Three are common to both TRAP-Ts and TPATs: the P component, a ligand-binding protein, and a transmembrane symporter apparatus comprising the M and Q components (M and Q are sometimes fused to form a single polypeptide). TPATs are distinguished from TRAP-Ts by the presence of a unique protein called the “T component”. In Treponema pallidum, this protein (TatT) is a water-soluble trimer whose protomers are each perforated by a pore. Its respective P component (TatPT) interacts with the TatT in vitro and in vivo. In this work, we further characterized this interaction. Co-crystal structures of two complexes between the two proteins confirm that up to three monomers of TatPT can bind to the TatT trimer. A putative ligand-binding cleft of TatPT aligns with the pore of TatT, strongly suggesting ligand transfer between T and PT. We used a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and analytical ultracentrifugation to derive thermodynamic parameters for the interactions. These observations confirm that the observed crystallographic interface is recapitulated in solution.

The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation has been proposed to follow a nucleation dependent polymerization model, dependent upon the size of the nucleus. This model and the effect of the polyglutamine length on the nucleus size are reviewed. Aggregate structure is characterized at two different levels. The atomic-scale resolution structure of fibrillar and crystalline aggregates of polyglutamine containing proteins and peptides was determined by X-ray crystallography and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The chapter outlines the results obtained by both these techniques. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was instrumental in elucidating the morphology of fibrils, their organization and assembly.

In order to further explore the contributions of the C-terminal region of α-synuclein in fibril formation and also to understand the overall mechanism of fibril formation, we reduced the number of negatively charged residues in the C-terminal region using mutagenesis. Mutants with negative charges deleted displayed accelerated fibril formation compared with wild-type α-synuclein, demonstrating that negative charges located in the C-terminal region of α-synuclein modulate fibril formation. Additionally, when tyrosine residues located at position 125, 133, and 136 in the C-terminal region were changed to alanine residue(s), we found that all mutants containing the Tyr136Ala mutation showed delays in fibril formation compared with wild type. Mutation of Tyr136 to various amino acids revealed that aromatic residues located at this position act favorably toward fibril formation. In mutants where charge neutralization and tyrosine substitution were combined, we found that these two factors influence fibril formation in complex fashion. These findings highlight the importance of negative charges and aromatic side chains in the C-terminal region of α-synuclein in fibril formation.",Amyloid;amyloid formation mechanism;Parkinson's disease;protein aggregation;site-directed mutagenesis;α-Synuclein

This is counteracted in part by the intra-S phase checkpoint, which stabilizes arrested replication machinery, prevents cell-cycle progression and promotes DNA repair. The checkpoint kinase Mec1/ATR and RecQ helicase Sgs1/BLM contribute synergistically to fork maintenance on hydroxyurea (HU). Both enzymes interact with replication protein A (RPA). We identified and deleted the major interaction sites on Sgs1 for Rpa70, generating a mutant called sgs1-r1. In contrast to a helicase-dead mutant of Sgs1, sgs1-r1 did not significantly reduce recovery of DNA polymerase α at HU-arrested replication forks. However, the Sgs1 R1 domain is a target of Mec1 kinase, deletion of which compromises Rad53 activation on HU. Full activation of Rad53 is achieved through phosphorylation of the Sgs1 R1 domain by Mec1, which promotes Sgs1 binding to the FHA1 domain of Rad53 with high affinity. We propose that the recruitment of Rad53 by phosphorylated Sgs1 promotes the replication checkpoint response on HU. Loss of the R1 domain increases lethality selectively in cells lacking Mus81, Slx4, Slx5 or Slx8.",intra-S checkpoint;RPA;replication stress;Rad53;Sgs1

They are characterized by high rates of metabolic activity and need to respond promptly to activity-dependent fluctuations in bioenergetic demand. The dimensions and polarity of neurons require efficient transport of mitochondria to hot spots of energy consumption, such as presynaptic and postsynaptic sites. Moreover, the postmitotic state of neurons in combination with their exposure to intrinsic and extrinsic neuronal stress factors call for a high fidelity of mitochondrial quality control systems. Consequently, it is not surprising that mitochondrial alterations can promote neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. In particular, mitochondrial dysfunction has long been implicated in the etiopathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), based on the observation that mitochondrial toxins can cause parkinsonism in humans and animal models. Substantial progress towards understanding the role of mitochondria in the disease process has been made by the identification and characterization of genes causing familial variants of PD. Studies on the function and dysfunction of these genes revealed that various aspects of mitochondrial biology appear to be affected in PD, comprising mitochondrial biogenesis, bioenergetics, dynamics, transport, and quality control.",mitochondria;parkin;Parkinson;PINK1;synuclein

Tetrameric proteins consist of two obligatory GluN1 (N1) and two GluN2 (N2) subunits, of which GluN2A (2A) and GluN2B (2B) are prevalent in adult brain. The intracellularly located C-terminal domains (CTDs) make a significant portion of mass of the receptors and are essential for plasticity and excitotoxicity, but their functions are incompletely defined. Recent evidence shows that truncation of the N2 CTD alters channel kinetics; however, the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. Here we recorded activity from individual NRs lacking the CTDs of N1, 2A, or 2B and determined the gating mechanisms of these receptors. Receptors lacking the N1 CTDs had larger unitary conductance and faster deactivation kinetics, receptors lacking the 2A or 2B CTDs had longer openings and longer desensitized intervals, and the first 100 amino acids of the N2 CTD were essential for these changes. In addition, receptors lacking the CTDs of either 2A or 2B maintained isoform-specific kinetic differences and swapping CTDs between 2A and 2B had no effect on single-channel properties. Based on these results, we suggest that perturbations in the CTD can modify the NR-mediated signal in a subunit-dependent manner, in 2A these effects are most likely mediated by membrane-proximal residues, and the isoform-specific biophysical properties conferred by 2A and 2B are CTD-independent. The kinetic mechanisms we developed afford a quantitative approach to understanding how the intracellular domains of NR subunits can modulate the responses of the receptor.",Gating;Glutamate Receptors Ionotropic (AMPA;NMDA);Ion Channels;Kinetics;Patch Clamp Electrophysiology;Single Molecule Biophysics

The formation of amyloid is associated with over 27 distinct human diseases which are collectively referred to as the amyloidoses. Although there is great diversity amongst the amyloidoses with regard to the polypeptide monomeric precursor, targeted tissues, and the nature and time course of disease development, the common underlying link of a structurally similar amyloid aggregate has prompted the search for a unified theory of disease progression in which amyloid production is the central element. Computational modeling has allowed the formulation and testing of scientific hypotheses for exploring this relationship. However, the majority of computational studies on amyloid aggregation are pitched at the atomistic level of description, in simple ideal solution environments, with simulation time scales of the order of microseconds and system sizes limited to 100 monomers (or fewer). The experimental reality is that disease-related amyloid aggregation processes occur in extremely complex reaction environments (i.e. the human body), over time scales of months to years with monitoring of the reaction achieved using extremely coarse or indirect experimental markers that yield little or no atomistic insight. Clearly, a substantial gap exists between computational and experimental communities with a deficit of ‘useful’ computational methodology that can be directly related to available markers of disease progression. This review will place its focus on the development of these latter types of computational models and discuss them in relation to disease onset and progression.",Amyloid;Amyloidosis;Computational modeling;Simulation;Diabetes;Alzheimer’s;Yeast prions

Dormant conidia started to grow isotropically two h after inoculation in liquid medium. Isotropic growth changed to polarised growth after 6 h, which coincided with one round of mitosis. Dormant conidia contained transcripts from 4 626 genes. The number of genes with transcripts decreased to 3 557 after 2 h of germination, after which an increase was observed with 4 780 expressed genes 8 h after inoculation. The RNA composition of dormant conidia was substantially different than all the subsequent stages of germination. The correlation coefficient between the RNA profiles of 0 h and 8 h was 0.46. They were between 0.76–0.93 when profiles of 2, 4 and 6 h were compared with that of 8 h. Dormant conidia were characterised by high levels of transcripts of genes involved in the formation of protecting components such as trehalose, mannitol, protective proteins (e.g. heat shock proteins and catalase). Transcripts belonging to the Functional Gene Categories (FunCat) protein synthesis, cell cycle and DNA processing and respiration were over-represented in the up-regulated genes at 2 h, whereas metabolism and cell cycle and DNA processing were over-represented in the up-regulated genes at 4 h. At 6 h and 8 h no functional gene classes were over- or under-represented in the differentially expressed genes. Taken together, it is concluded that the transcriptome of conidia changes dramatically during the first two h and that initiation of protein synthesis and respiration are important during early stages of germination.",Aspergillus niger;conidia;germination;transcriptome

Recent progress in understanding the biology and mechanism of induction revealed a critical role of induction in cellular defense against electrophilic and oxidative stress. Induction is mediated through a novel signaling pathway via two regulatory proteins, the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and the Kelch-like erythroid cell-derived protein with CNC homology-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Nrf2 binds to Keap1 at a two site-binding interface and is ubiquitinated by the Keap1/cullin 3/ring box protein-1-ubiquitin ligase, resulting in a rapid turnover of Nrf2 protein. Electrophiles and oxidants modify critical cysteine thiols of Keap1 and Nrf2 to inhibit Nrf2 ubiquitination, leading to Nrf2 activation and induction. Induction increases stress resistance critical for cell survival, because knockout of Nrf2 in mice increased susceptibility to a variety of toxicity and disease processes. Collateral to diverse functions of Nrf2, genome-wide search has led to the identification of a plethora of ARE-dependent genes regulated by Nrf2 in an inducer-, tissue-, and disease-dependent manner to control drug metabolism, antioxidant defense, stress response, proteasomal degradation, and cell proliferation. The protective nature of Nrf2 could also be hijacked in a number of pathological conditions by means of somatic mutation, epigenetic alteration, and accumulation of disruptor proteins, promoting drug resistance in cancer and pathologic liver features in autophagy deficiency. The repertoire of ARE inducers has expanded enormously; the therapeutic potential of the inducers has been examined beyond cancer prevention. Developing potent and specific ARE inducers and Nrf2 inhibitors holds certain new promise for the prevention and therapy against cancer, chronic disease, and toxicity.",

The low capacity for PTMs hinders the production of heterologous proteins in the widely used prokaryotic systems of protein synthesis. Until now, a systematic and comprehensive study concerning the specific effects of individual PTMs on heterologous protein synthesis has not been presented. To address this issue, we expressed 1488 human proteins and their domains in a bacterial cell-free system, and we examined the correlation of the expression yields with the presence of multiple PTM sites bioinformatically predicted in these proteins. This approach revealed a number of previously unknown statistically significant correlations. Prediction of some PTMs, such as myristoylation, glycosylation, palmitoylation, and disulfide bond formation, was found to significantly worsen protein amenability to soluble expression. The presence of other PTMs, such as aspartyl hydroxylation, C-terminal amidation, and Tyr sulfation, did not correlate with the yield of heterologous protein expression. Surprisingly, the predicted presence of several PTMs, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, and prenylation, was associated with the increased production of properly folded soluble proteins. The plausible rationales for the existence of the observed correlations are presented. Our findings suggest that identification of potential PTMs in polypeptide sequences can be of practical use for predicting expression success and optimizing heterologous protein synthesis. In sum, this study provides the most compelling evidence so far for the role of multiple PTMs in the stability and solubility of heterologously expressed recombinant proteins.",Post-translational Modification;Protein Aggregation;Protein Folding;Proteomics;Recombinant Protein Expression;Heterologous Protein Expression;Predictive Bioinformatics

These mRNAs are unique in that they are not polyadenylated but have a stem-loop structure in their 3′ untranslated region. An early event in 3′ end formation of histone mRNAs is the binding of Stem-Loop Binding Protein (SLBP) to the stem-loop. Here we provide insight into the mechanism by which SLBP contacts the histone mRNA. There are two binding sites in the SLBP RBD for the histone mRNA hairpin. The first binding site (Glu129-Val158) consists of a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif that likely recognizes the unpaired uridines in the loop of the histone hairpin and upon binding, destabilizes the first G-C base-pair at the base of the stem. The second binding site lies between residues Arg180-Pro200 which appears to recognize the second G-C basepair from the base of the stem and possibly regions flanking the stem-loop. We show that the SLBP-histone mRNA complex is regulated by threonine phosphorylation and proline isomerization in a conserved TPNK sequence that lies between the two binding sites. Threonine phosphorylation increases the affinity of SLBP for histone mRNA by slowing the off-rate for complex dissociation whereas the adjacent proline acts as a critical hinge that may orient the second binding site for formation of a stable SLBP-histone mRNA complex. The NMR and kinetic studies presented here provide a framework for understanding how SLBP recognizes histone mRNA and highlight possible structural roles of phosphorylation and proline isomerization in RNA-binding proteins in remodeling ribonucleoprotein complexes.",SLBP;histone mRNA;stem-loop;phosphorylation;prolyl isomerization;protein-RNA recognition;kinetics;surface plasmon resonance;NMR spectroscopy;mass spectrometry

It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), of which the cftr ΔF508 mutation is the most common. ΔF508 macrophages are intrinsically defective in autophagy because of the sequestration of essential autophagy molecules within unprocessed CFTR aggregates. Defective autophagy allows Burkholderia cenocepacia (B. cepacia) to survive and replicate in ΔF508 macrophages. Infection by B. cepacia poses a great risk to cystic fibrosis patients because it causes accelerated lung inflammation and, in some cases, a lethal necrotizing pneumonia. Autophagy is a cell survival mechanism whereby an autophagosome engulfs non-functional organelles and delivers them to the lysosome for degradation. The ubiquitin binding adaptor protein SQSTM1/p62 is required for the delivery of several ubiquitinated cargos to the autophagosome. In WT macrophages, p62 depletion and overexpression lead to increased and decreased bacterial intracellular survival, respectively. In contrast, depletion of p62 in ΔF508 macrophages results in decreased bacterial survival, whereas overexpression of p62 leads to increased B. cepacia intracellular growth. Interestingly, the depletion of p62 from ΔF508 macrophages results in the release of the autophagy molecule beclin1 (BECN1) from the mutant CFTR aggregates and allows its redistribution and recruitment to the B. cepacia vacuole, mediating the acquisition of the autophagy marker LC3 and bacterial clearance via autophagy. These data demonstrate that p62 differentially dictates the fate of B. cepacia infection in WT and ΔF508 macrophages.",Autophagy;Bacterial Pathogenesis;Cystic Fibrosis;Innate Immunity;Trafficking;Burkholderia cenocepacia

The transition from harmless colonization to disease is typically preceded by antimicrobial therapy, which alters the balance of the intestinal flora, enabling C. difficile to proliferate in the colon. One of the most perplexing aspects of the C. difficile infectious cycle is its ability to survive antimicrobial therapy and transition from inert colonization to active infection. Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems have been implicated in facilitating persistence after antibiotic treatment. We identified only one TA system in C. difficile strain 630 (epidemic type X), designated MazE-cd and MazF-cd, a counterpart of the well-characterized Escherichia coli MazEF TA system. This E. coli MazF toxin cleaves mRNA at ACA sequences, leading to global mRNA degradation, growth arrest, and death. Likewise, MazF-cd expression in E. coli or Clostridium perfringens resulted in growth arrest. Primer extension analysis revealed that MazF-cd cleaved RNA at the five-base consensus sequence UACAU, suggesting that the mRNAs susceptible to cleavage comprise a subset of total mRNAs. In agreement, we observed differential cleavage of several mRNAs by MazF-cd in vivo, revealing a direct correlation between the number of cleavage recognition sites within a given transcript and its susceptibility to degradation by MazF-cd. Interestingly, upon detailed statistical analyses of the C. difficile transcriptome, the major C. difficile virulence factor toxin B (TcdB) and CwpV, a cell wall protein involved in aggregation, were predicted to be significantly resistant to MazF-cd cleavage.",

In this study calpain was found to cleave GSK-3β not only at the N terminus but also at the C terminus, and cleavage sites were identified at residues Thr-38–Thr-39 and Ile-384–Gln-385. Furthermore, the cleavage of GSK-3β occurred in tandem with Ser-9 dephosphorylation during cerebellar granule neuron apoptosis. Increasing Ser-9 phosphorylation of GSK-3β by inhibiting phosphatase 1/2A or pretreating with purified active Akt inhibited calpain-mediated cleavage of GSK-3β at both N and C termini, whereas non-phosphorylatable mutant GSK-3β S9A facilitated its cleavage. In contrast, Ser-389 phosphorylation selectively inhibited the cleavage of GSK-3β at the C terminus but not the N terminus. Calpain-mediated cleavage resulted in three truncated products, all of which contained an intact kinase domain: ΔN-GSK-3β (amino acids 39–420), ΔC-GSK-3β (amino acids 1–384), and ΔN/ΔC-GSK-3β (amino acids 39–384). All three truncated products showed increased kinase and pro-apoptotic activity, with ΔN/ΔC-GSK-3β being the most active form. This observation suggests that the GSK-3β C terminus acts as an autoinhibitory domain similar to the N terminus. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that calpain-mediated cleavage activates GSK-3β by removing its N- and C-terminal autoinhibitory domains and that Ser-9 phosphorylation inhibits the cleavage of GSK-3β at both termini. In contrast, Ser-389 phosphorylation inhibits only C-terminal cleavage but not N-terminal cleavage. These findings also identify a mechanism by which site-specific phosphorylation and calpain-mediated cleavage operate in concert to regulate GSK-3β activity.",Calpain;Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3;Neurodegeneration;Neurons;Phosphorylation;Cerebellar Granule Neuron;Cleavage;Neuronal Death

protein tau is found aggregated into paired helical filaments (PHFs) in
neurofibrillary deposits. In solution, tau is intrinsically unstructured.
However, the tubulin binding domain consisting of three or four 31–32
amino acid repeat regions exhibits both helical and β-structure
propensity and makes up the proteolysis resistant core of PHFs. Here, we studied
the structure and dynamics of the three-repeat domain of tau (i.e. K19) when
bound to membranes consisting of a phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine
mixture or phosphatidylserine alone. Tau K19 binds to phospholipid vesicles with
submicromolar affinity as measured by fluorescence spectroscopy. The interaction
is driven by electrostatic forces between the positively charged protein and the
phospholipid head groups. The structure of the membrane-bound state of K19 was
studied using CD spectroscopy and solid-state magic-angle spinning NMR
spectroscopy. To this end, the protein was selectively 13C-labeled at
all valine and leucine residues. Isotropic chemical shift values of tau K19 were
consistent with a β-structure. In addition, motionally averaged
1H-13C dipolar couplings indicated a high rigidity of
the protein backbone. The structure formation of K19 was also shown to depend on
the charge density of the membrane. Phosphatidylserine membranes induced a gain
in the α-helix structure along with an immersion of K19 into the
phospholipid bilayer as indicated by a reduction of the lipid chain
2H NMR order parameter. Our results provide structural insights into
the membrane-bound state of tau K19 and support a potential role of phospholipid

Many of these features have been hypothesized to enable plants, which cannot easily escape environmental challenges, to rapidly adapt. Another mechanism, which has recently been well described as a major facilitator of rapid adaptation in bacteria, animals, and fungi but not yet for plants, is modular rearrangement of protein-coding genes. Due to the high precision of profile-based methods, rearrangements can be well captured at the protein level by characterizing the emergence, loss, and rearrangements of protein domains, their structural, functional, and evolutionary building blocks. Here, we study the dynamics of domain rearrangements and explore their adaptive benefit in 27 plant and 3 algal genomes. We use a phylogenomic approach by which we can explain the formation of 88% of all arrangements by single-step events, such as fusion, fission, and terminal loss of domains. We find many domains are lost along every lineage, but at least 500 domains are novel, that is, they are unique to green plants and emerged more or less recently. These novel domains duplicate and rearrange more readily within their genomes than ancient domains and are overproportionally involved in stress response and developmental innovations. Novel domains more often affect regulatory proteins and show a higher degree of structural disorder than ancient domains. Whereas a relatively large and well-conserved core set of single-domain proteins exists, long multi-domain arrangements tend to be species-specific. We find that duplicated genes are more often involved in rearrangements. Although fission events typically impact metabolic proteins, fusion events often create new signaling proteins essential for environmental sensing. Taken together, the high volatility of single domains and complex arrangements in plant genomes demonstrate the importance of modularity for environmental adaptability of plants.",plant genome evolution;modular evolution;whole-genome duplication;evolution of stress response

Structural similarity to cadherins suggested calcium-dependent oligomerization of CHDL domains as a mechanistic basis for RapA action. Here we show by circular dichroism spectroscopy, light scattering, isothermal titration calorimetry, and other methods that RapA2 from Rhizobium leguminosarum indeed exhibits a cadherin-like β-sheet conformation and that its proper folding and stability are dependent on the binding of one calcium ion per protein molecule. By further in silico analysis we also reveal that RapA2 consists of two CHDL domains and expand the range of CHDL-containing proteins in bacteria and archaea. However, light scattering assays at various concentrations of added calcium revealed that RapA2 formed neither homo-oligomers nor hetero-oligomers with RapB (a distinct CHDL protein), indicating that RapA2 does not mediate cellular interactions through a cadherin-like mechanism. Instead, we demonstrate that RapA2 interacts specifically with the acidic exopolysaccharides (EPSs) produced by R. leguminosarum in a calcium-dependent manner, sustaining a role of these proteins in the development of the biofilm matrix made of EPS. Because EPS binding by RapA2 can only be attributed to its two CHDL domains, we propose that RapA2 is a calcium-dependent lectin and that CHDL domains in various bacterial and archaeal proteins confer carbohydrate binding activity to these proteins.",Bacteria;Calcium;Carbohydrate Binding Protein;Lectin;Polysaccharide;Rhizobium;Cadherin-like Domain (CHDL)

Ub/Ubls contain the beta-grasp fold (beta-GF) that is also found in Ub-related domains of several other proteins of the Ub-system and numerous proteins with biochemically distinct roles unrelated to the conventional Ub-system. Taken together, domains displaying the beta-grasp include versions performing catalytic roles, scaffolding of iron-sulfur clusters, binding of RNA and other biomolecules such as co-factors and sulfur transfer in biosynthesis of diverse metabolites. The beta-GF appears to have undergone an early radiation spawning at least seven clades prior to the divergence of extant organisms from their last universal common ancestor. The beta-GF appears to have first emerged in the context of translation-related RNA-interactions and subsequently exploded to occupy various functional niches. Most structural and biochemical diversification of the beta-GF occurred in prokaryotes, with the Ubl clade showing a dramatic expansion in the eukaryotic phase of its evolution. Hence, at least 70 distinct Ubl families are observed in eukaryotes, of which nearly 20 families were probably present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Diversification of Ubl families early in eukaryotic evolution played a major role in emergence of characteristic eukaryotic cellular sub-structures and systems pertaining to nucleo-cytoplasmic compartmentalization and dynamics, vesicular trafficking, autophagy and different protein degradation systems. Recent comparative genomics studies indicate that precursors of the eukaryotic Ub-system emerged first in prokaryotes. The simplest of these combine an Ubl and an E1-like enzyme involved in metabolic pathways related metallopterin, thiamine, cysteine, siderophore and perhaps modified base biosynthesis. Sampylation in archaea and Urmylation in eukaryotes appear to represent direct recruitment of such systems as simple protein-tagging apparatuses. However, other prokaryotic systems incorporated further components that more or less mirror the eukaryotic condition in possessing an E2, a RING-type E3 or both of these components.

Here, using the newly described protein interaction platform assay, we demonstrate that type 3 secretion system class IB chaperones from one bacterium directly bind their own effectors as well as those from other species. In addition, we observe that expression of class IB homologs from seven species, including pathogens and endosymbionts, mediate the translocation of effectors from Shigella directly into host cells, demonstrating that class IB chaperones are often functionally interchangeable. Notably, class IB chaperones bind numerous effectors. However, as previously proposed, they are not promiscuous; rather they recognize a defined sequence that we designate the conserved chaperone-binding domain (CCBD) sequence [(LMIF)1XXX(IV)5XX(IV)8X(N)10]. This sequence is the first defined amino acid sequence to be identified for any interspecies bacterial secretion system, i.e., a system that delivers proteins directly into eukaryotic cells. This sequence provides a new means to identify substrates of type III secretion systems. Indeed, using a pattern search algorithm for the CCBD sequence, we have identified the first two probable effectors from an endosymbiont, Sodalis glossinidius.",

A working model suggests that under times of stress, antitoxin molecules are degraded, releasing the toxins to slow the metabolism of the cell, which in the case of VapC toxins is via their RNase activity. Otherwise the TA pairs remain bound to their promoters, autoinhibiting transcription. The crystal structure of Rv0301-Rv0300, an Mtb VapBC TA complex determined at 1.49 Å resolution, suggests a mechanism for these three functions: RNase activity, its inhibition by antitoxin, and its ability to bind promoter DNA. The Rv0301 toxin consists of a core of five parallel beta strands flanked by alpha helices. Three proximal aspartates coordinate a Mg2+ ion forming the putative RNase active site. The Rv0300 antitoxin monomer is extended in structure, consisting of an N-terminal beta strand followed by four helices. The last two helices wrap around the toxin and terminate near the putative RNase active site, but with different conformations. In one conformation, the C-terminal arginine interferes with Mg2+ ion coordination, suggesting a mechanism by which the antitoxin can inhibit toxin activity. At the N-terminus of the antitoxin, two pairs of Ribbon-Helix-Helix (RHH) motifs are related by crystallographic twofold symmetry. The resulting hetero-octameric complex is similar to the FitAB system, but the two RHH motifs are about 30 Å closer together in the Rv0301-Rv0300 complex, suggesting either a different span of the DNA recognition sequence or a conformational change.",tuberculosis;toxin-antitoxin;toxin;antitoxin;vapBC;vapB;vapC;protein complex;Rv0301;Rv0300;PIN-domain

Because of its high tendency to aggregate and its low solubility in water, the structure of this peptide is still unknown. In this work, we sought to understand the early stages of aggregation of the amyloid-β(25–35) peptide by conducting simulations of oligomers ranging from monomers to tetramers. Our simulations show that although the monomer preferentially adopts a β-hairpin conformation, larger aggregates have extended structures, and a clear transition from compact β-hairpin conformations to extended β-strand structures occurs between dimers and trimers. Even though β-hairpins are not present in the final architecture of the fibril, our simulations indicate that they play a critical role in fibril growth. Our simulations also show that β-sheet structures are stabilized when a β-hairpin is present at the edge of the sheet. The binding of the hairpin to the sheet leads to a subsequent destabilization of the hairpin, with part of the hairpin backbone dangling in solution. This free section of the peptide can then recruit an extra monomer from solution, leading to further sheet extension. Our simulations indicate that the peptide must possess sufficient conformational flexibility to switch between a hairpin and an extended conformation in order for β-sheet extension to occur, and offer a rationalization for the experimental observation that overstabilizing a hairpin conformation in the monomeric state (for example, through chemical cross-linking) significantly hampers the fibrillization process.",

Although the origin and evolution of these diseases are completely different, characteristic deposits of protein aggregates (huntingtin and α-synuclein resp.), are a common feature in both diseases. After these observations, many studies are performed with both proteins. Some of them try to understand the nature and driving forces of the aggregation process; others try to find a correlation between the genetic and failure in protein function. Finally with the combination of both approaches, it was proposed that possible strategies deal with pathologic aggregation. Unfortunately, if protein aggregation is a cause or a consequence of the neurodegeneration observed in these pathologies, it is still debatable. This paper describes the process of aggregation of two proteins: huntingtin and α synuclein. The characteristics of the aggregation reaction of these proteins have been followed with novel methods both in vivo and in vitro; these studies include both the combination with other proteins and the presence of various chemical compounds. The ultimate goal of this study was to summarize recent findings on protein aggregation and its possible role as a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases and their role in biomaterial science.",

Two subunits (Arp2 and Arp3) in this seven-subunit assembly are closely related to actin and upon activation of the complex form a “cryptic dimer” that stably mimics an actin dimer to nucleate a new filament. Both Arps contain a shared actin core structure, and each Arp contains multiple insertions of unknown function at conserved positions within the core. Here we characterize three key insertions within the actin core of Arp3 and show that each one plays a distinct role in modulating Arp2/3 function. The β4/β5 insert mediates interactions of Arp2/3 complex with actin filaments and “dampers” the nucleation activity of the complex. The Arp3 hydrophobic plug plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of the complex but is not absolutely required for formation of the daughter filament nucleus. Deletion of the αK/β15 insert did not constitutively activate the complex, as previously hypothesized. Instead, it abolished in vitro nucleation activity and caused defects in endocytic actin patch assembly in fission yeast, indicating a role for the αK/β15 insert in the activated state of the complex. Biochemical characterization of each mutant revealed steps in the nucleation pathway influenced by each Arp3-specific insert to provide new insights into the structural basis of activation of the complex.",Actin;ATP;Cell Motility;Endocytosis;Mutagenesis

Similarly, interaction between the Dreb2a and Med25 in the absence of DNA results in conformational changes. However, the presence of the canonical Dreb2a DNA-binding site reduces the affinity between Dreb2a and Med25.

Protection is achieved by selective engagement of FH, via CCPs 1–4, CCPs 6–8 and CCPs 19–20, with polyanion-rich host surfaces that bear covalently attached, activation-specific, fragments of complement component C3. The role of intervening CCPs 9–18 in this process is obscured by lack of structural knowledge. We have concatenated new high-resolution solution structures of overlapping recombinant CCP pairs, 10–11 and 11–12, to form a three-dimensional structure of CCPs 10–12 and validated it by small-angle X-ray scattering of the recombinant triple‐module fragment. Superimposing CCP 12 of this 10–12 structure with CCP 12 from the previously solved CCP 12–13 structure yielded an S-shaped structure for CCPs 10–13 in which modules are tilted by 80–110° with respect to immediate neighbors, but the bend between CCPs 10 and 11 is counter to the arc traced by CCPs 11–13. Including this four-CCP structure in interpretation of scattering data for the longer recombinant segments, CCPs 10–15 and 8–15, implied flexible attachment of CCPs 8 and 9 to CCP 10 but compact and intimate arrangements of CCP 14 with CCPs 12, 13 and 15. Taken together with difficulties in recombinant production of module pairs 13–14 and 14–15, the aberrant structure of CCP 13 and the variability of 13–14 linker sequences among orthologues, a structural dependency of CCP 14 on its neighbors is suggested; this has implications for the FH mechanism.",CCP;complement control protein; CR1;complement receptor type 1; DAF;decay accelerating factor; FH;factor H; EOM;ensemble optimization method; HSQC;heteronuclear single quantum coherence; MCP;membrane cofactor protein; NOE;nuclear Overhauser enhancement; SAXS;small-angle X-ray scattering; TOCSY;total correlated spectroscopy

The question is then if side-chain charges, due to their desolvation penalties, play a corresponding role in protein folding by avoiding competing, misfolded traps? To find out, we removed all 32 side-chain charges from the 101-residue protein S6 from Thermus thermophilus. The results show that the charge-depleted S6 variant not only retains its native structure and cooperative folding transition, but folds also faster than the wild-type protein. In addition, charge removal unleashes pronounced aggregation on longer timescales. S6 provides thus an example where the bias toward native contacts of a naturally evolved protein sequence is independent of charges, and point at a fundamental difference in the codes for folding and intermolecular interaction: specificity in folding is governed primarily by hydrophobic packing and hydrogen bonding, whereas solubility and binding relies critically on the interplay of side-chain charges.",folding cooperativity;protein aggregation;protein charges;protein engineering;protein folding

Major and minor NMR peaks implicate substates affecting 28% of assigned residues. These are attributable to the phosphorylation state and possibly to conformational interconversions. S108C substitution of the phosphoryl donor and acceptor slowed transformation of the glucose-1-phosphate substrate by impairment of kcat. Addition of the glucose-1,6-bisphosphate intermediate accelerated this reaction by 2 – 3 orders of magnitude, somewhat bypassing the defect and apparently relieving substrate inhibition. The S108C mutation perturbs the NMR spectra and electron density map around the catalytic cleft, while preserving the secondary structure in solution. Diminished peak heights and faster 15N relaxation are suggestive of line broadening and millisecond fluctuations within four loops that can contact phosphosugars. 15N NMR relaxation and peak heights suggest that domain 4 reorients slightly faster in solution than domains 1 to 3, and with a different principal axis of diffusion.

For the first time, to our knowledge, we used NR to obtain direct quantitative evidence of α-syn-induced membrane thinning. To examine the effect of specific residues on membrane penetration depths, we used a series of W4-containing N-terminal peptides. We identified that the first 15 residues (P15) nearly recapitulate the features of the full-length protein (i.e., partition constants, molecular mobility, and insertion of the W4 side chain into the bilayer), and found that as few as the first four N-terminal residues are sufficient for vesicle binding. Although at least one imperfect amphipathic repeat sequence (KAKEGV) is required for α-helical formation, secondary structural formation has little effect on membrane affinity. To develop an N-terminal α-syn model for bilayer interactions, we performed molecular-dynamics simulations of the P15 peptide submerged in a bilayer. The simulation results are highly consistent with experimental data indicating a broad low-energy region (8.5–14.5 Å) for W4 insertion.",

LL-23 demonstrated, compared to LL-37, a conserved ability to induce the chemokine MCP-1 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a lack of ability to suppress induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and reduced antimicrobial activity. Heteronuclear multidimensional NMR characterization of LL-23 revealed similar secondary structures and backbone dynamics in three membrane-mimetic micelles: SDS, dodecylphosphocholine (DPC), and dioctanoylphosphatidylglycerol. The NMR structure of LL-23 determined in perdeuterated DPC contained a unique serine that segregated the hydrophobic surface of the amphipathic helix into two domains. To gain further understanding, Ser9 of LL-23 was changed to either Ala or Val based on homologous primate cathelicidins. These changes made the hydrophobic surface of LL-23 continuous and enhanced antibacterial activity. While identical helical structures did not explain the altered activities, a reduced hydrogen-deuterium exchange from LL-23, LL-23A9, to LL-23V9 suggested a deeper penetration of LL-23V9 into the interior of the micelles, which correlated with enhanced activities. Moreover, these LL-23 variants had discrete immunomodulatory activities. Both restored the TNF-α dampening activity to the level of LL-37. Furthermore, LL-23A9, like LL-23, maintained superior protective MCP-1 production, while LL-23V9 was strongly immunosuppressive, preventing baseline MCP-1 induction and substantially reducing LPS-stimulated MCP-1 production. Thus, these LL-23 variants, designed based on a structural hot spot, are promising immune modulators that are easier to synthesize and less toxic to mammalian cells than the parent peptide LL-37.",Antimicrobial peptides;Drug design;immune modulating peptides;micelles;NMR;protein dynamics;structure-activity relationship (SAR)

In all organisms that contain selenocysteine, both the synthesis of selenocysteine and its incorporation into a selenoprotein requires an elaborate synthetic and translational apparatus, which does not resemble the canonical enzymatic system employed for the 20 standard amino acids. In humans, three synthetic enzymes, a specialized elongation factor, an accessory protein factor, two catabolic enzymes, a tRNA, and a stem-loop structure in the selenoprotein mRNA are critical for ensuring that only selenocysteine is attached to selenocysteine tRNA and that only selenocysteine is inserted into the nascent polypeptide in response to a context-dependent UGA codon. The abnormal selenium homeostasis and mutations in selenoprotein genes have been causatively linked to a variety of human diseases, which, in turn, sparked a renewed interest in utilizing selenium as the dietary supplement to either prevent or remedy pathologic conditions. In contrast, the importance of the components of the selenocysteine-synthetic machinery for human health is less clear. Emerging evidence suggests that enzymes responsible for selenocysteine formation and decoding the selenocysteine UGA codon, which by extension are critical for synthesis of the entire selenoproteome, are essential for the development and health of the human organism.",

Mean-squared displacements (MSD) and protein resilience on the picosecond-to-nanosecond timescale were measured by elastic incoherent neutron scattering. Differences in thermodynamic parameters, MSD, and resilience were observed for both proteins. The resilience of holo-Mb was significantly lower than that of apo-Mb, indicating entropic stabilization by a higher degree of conformational sampling in the heme-bound folded protein. Molecular dynamics simulations provided site-specific information. Averaged over the whole structure, the molecular dynamics simulations yielded similar MSD and resilience values for the two proteins. The mobility of residues around the heme group in holo-Mb showed a smaller MSD and higher resilience compared to the same residue group in apo-Mb. It is of interest that in holo-Mb, higher MSD values are observed for the residues outside the heme pocket, indicating an entropic contribution to protein stabilization by heme binding, which is in agreement with experimental results.",

Caoili: hp.ude.mpu.tsop@gnodab;Academic Editor: Tatsuya Akutsu","B-cell epitope prediction aims to aid the design of peptide-based immunogens (e.g., vaccines) for eliciting antipeptide antibodies that protect against disease, but such antibodies fail to confer protection and even promote disease if they bind with low affinity. Hence, the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) was searched to obtain published thermodynamic and kinetic data on binding interactions of antipeptide antibodies. The data suggest that the affinity of the antibodies for their immunizing peptides appears to be limited in a manner consistent with previously proposed kinetic constraints on affinity maturation in vivo and that cross-reaction of the antibodies with proteins tends to occur with lower affinity than the corresponding reaction of the antibodies with their immunizing peptides. These observations better inform B-cell epitope prediction to avoid overestimating the affinity for both active and passive immunization; whereas active immunization is subject to limitations of affinity maturation in vivo and of the capacity to accumulate endogenous antibodies, passive immunization may transcend such limitations, possibly with the aid of artificial affinity-selection processes and of protein engineering. Additionally, protein disorder warrants further investigation as a possible supplementary criterion for B-cell epitope prediction, where such disorder obviates thermodynamically unfavorable protein structural adjustments in cross-reactions between antipeptide antibodies and proteins.",

Although previous studies have shown that antibodies against the virus are produced during and after infection, the fine specificity of the antibody response against CHIKV is not known. Here, using plasma from patients at different times postinfection, we characterized the antibody response against various proteins of the virus. We have shown that the E2 and E3 glycoproteins and the capsid and nsP3 proteins are targets of the anti-CHIKV antibody response. Moreover, we have identified the different regions in these proteins which contain the linear epitopes recognized by the anti-CHIKV antibodies and determined their structural localization. Data also illustrated the effect of a single K252Q amino acid change at the E2 glycoprotein that was able to influence antibody binding and interaction between the antibodies and epitope because of the changes of epitope-antibody binding capacity. This study provides important knowledge that will not only aid in the understanding of the immune response to CHIKV infection but also provide new knowledge in the design of modern vaccine development. Furthermore, these pathogen-specific epitopes could be used for future seroepidemiological studies that will unravel the molecular mechanisms of human immunity and protection from CHIKV disease.",

The p66α-MBD2 interaction differs from most coiled-coils studied to date by forming an anti-parallel heterodimeric complex between two peptides that are largely monomeric in isolation. To further characterize unique features of this complex that drive heterodimeric specificity and high affinity binding, we carried out biophysical analyses of MBD2 and the related homologues MBD3, MBD3-like protein 1 (MBD3L1), and MBD3-like protein 2 (MBD3L2) as well as specific mutations that modify charge-charge interactions and helical propensity of the coiled-coil domains. Analytical ultracentrifugation analyses show that the individual peptides remain monomeric in isolation even at 300 μm in concentration for MBD2. Circular dichroism analyses demonstrate a direct correlation between helical content of the coiled-coil domains in isolation and binding affinity for p66α. Furthermore, complementary electrostatic surface potentials and inherent helical content of each peptide are necessary to maintain high-affinity association. These factors lead to a binding affinity hierarchy of p66α for the different MBD2 homologues (MBD2 ≈ MBD3 > MBD3L1 ≈ MBD3L2) and suggest a hierarchical regulatory model in tissue and life cycle stage-specific silencing by NuRD complexes.",Calorimetry;Chromatin Remodeling;Circular Dichroism (CD);DNA Methylation;Protein-Protein Interactions;Coiled-coil Domain;NuRD

In melanocytes H11/HspB8 causes growth arrest. It is silenced in a high proportion of melanoma prostate cancer, Ewing's sarcoma and hematologic malignancies through aberrant DNA methylation. Its restored expression induces cell death and inhibits tumor growth in xenograft models, identifying H11/HspB8 as a tumor suppressor. This function involves the activation of multiple and distinct death pathways, all of which initiate with H11/HspB8-mediated phosphorylation of transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1).

Two motifs, a dynamic activation segment and a GHI helical subdomain, distinguish the eukaryotic protein kinases (EPKs) from the more primitive eukaryotic-like kinases. The EPKs are themselves highly regulated, typically by phosphorylation, and this allows them to be rapidly turned on and off. The EPKs have a novel hydrophobic architecture that is typically regulated by the dynamic assembly of two hydrophobic spines that is usually mediated by the phosphorylation of an activation loop phosphate. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A (PKA)) is used as a prototype to exemplify these features of the PKA superfamily. Specificity in PKA signalling is achieved in large part by packaging the enzyme as inactive tetrameric holoenzymes with regulatory subunits that then are localized to macromolecular complexes in close proximity to dedicated substrates by targeting scaffold proteins. In this way, the cell creates discrete foci that most likely represent the physiological environment for cyclic AMP-mediated signalling.",phosphorylation;protein kinases;evolution

Among various types of inherited epilepsies different epilepsy syndromes, among them progressive myoclonus epilepsies with features of ataxia and neurodegeneration, are counted. The progressive myoclonus epilepsy of type 1 (EPM1), also known as Unverricht-Lundborg disease presents with features of cerebellar atrophy and increased oxidative stress. It has been found that EPM1 is caused by mutations in human cystatin B gene (human stefin B). We first describe the role of protein aggregation in other neurodegenerative conditions. Protein aggregates appear intraneurally but are also excreted, such as is the case with senile plaques of amyloid-β (Aβ) that accumulate in the brain parenchyma and vessel walls. A common characteristic of such diseases is the change of the protein conformation toward β secondary structure that accounts for the strong tendency of such proteins to aggregate and form amyloid fibrils. Second, we describe the patho-physiology of EPM1 and the normal and aberrant roles of stefin B in a mouse model of the disease. Furthermore, we discuss how the increased protein aggregation observed with some of the mutants of human stefin B may relate to the neurodegeneration that occurs in rare EPM1 patients. Our hypothesis (Ceru et al., 2005) states that some of the EPM1 mutants of human stefin B may undergo aggregation in neural cells, thus gaining additional toxic function (apart from loss of normal function). Our in vitro experiments thus far have confirmed that four mutants undergo increased aggregation relative to the wild-type protein. It has been shown that the R68X mutant forms amyloid-fibrils very rapidly, even at neutral pH and forms perinuclear inclusions, whereas the G4R mutant exhibits a prolonged lag phase, during which the toxic prefibrillar aggregates accumulate and are scattered more diffusely over the cytoplasm.

Studies with murine norovirus (MNV), which can be propagated in permissive cells, have begun to probe different aspects of the norovirus life cycle; however, our understanding of the specific functions of the viral proteins lags far behind that of other RNA viruses. Genome-wide functional profiling by insertional mutagenesis can reveal protein domains essential for replication and can lead to generation of tagged viruses, which has not yet been achieved for noroviruses. Here, transposon-mediated insertional mutagenesis was used to create 5 libraries of mutagenized MNV infectious clones, each containing a 15-nucleotide sequence randomly inserted within a defined region of the genome. Infectious virus was recovered from each library and was subsequently passaged in cell culture to determine the effect of each insertion by insertion-specific fluorescent PCR profiling. Genome-wide profiling of over 2,000 insertions revealed essential protein domains and confirmed known functional motifs. As validation, several insertion sites were introduced into a wild-type clone, successfully allowing the recovery of infectious virus. Screening of a number of reporter proteins and epitope tags led to the generation of the first infectious epitope-tagged noroviruses carrying the FLAG epitope tag in either NS4 or VP2. Subsequent work confirmed that epitope-tagged fully infectious noroviruses may be of use in the dissection of the molecular interactions that occur within the viral replication complex.",

Phosphorylation of Prdx6 changed the conformation of the N-terminal domain exposing Trp 33, as determined by tryptophan fluorescence and NaI fluorescence quenching. The kinetics of interaction of proteins with unilamellar liposomes (DPPC/egg PC/cholesterol/PG; 50:25:15:10, mol/mol) was evaluated with tryptophan fluorescence. pPrdx6 bound to liposomes with higher affinity (Kd, 5.6 ± 1.2 μM) in comparison to Prdx6 (Kd, 24.9 ± 4.5 μM). By isothermal titration calorimetry, pPrdx6 bound to liposomes with a large exothermic heat loss (ΔH = -31.49 ± 0.22 kcal mol-1). Correlating our conformation studies with the published crystal structure of oxidized Prdx6 suggests that phosphorylation results in exposure of hydrophobic residues, thereby providing accessibility to the sites for liposome binding. Because binding of the enzyme to the phospholipid substrate interface is a requirement for PLA2 activity, these results indicate that a change in the conformation of Prdx6 upon its phosphorylation is the basis for enhancement of PLA2 enzymatic activity.",

During the late phase of the HIV-1 infection, Gag polyproteins are transported to the plasma membrane (PM) for assembly. In the past two decades, in vivo, in vitro, and structural studies have shown that Gag trafficking and targeting to the PM are orchestrated events that are dependent on multiple factors including cellular proteins and specific membrane lipids. The matrix (MA) domain of Gag has been the focus of these studies as it appears to be engaged in multiple intracellular interactions that are suggested to be critical for virus assembly and replication. The interaction between Gag and the PM is perhaps the most understood. It is now established that the ultimate localization of Gag on punctate sites on the PM is mediated by specific interactions between the MA domain of Gag and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2], a minor lipid localized on the inner leaflet of the PM. Structure-based studies revealed that binding of PI(4,5)P2 to MA induces minor conformational changes, leading to exposure of the myristyl (myr) group. Exposure of the myr group is also triggered by binding of calmodulin, enhanced by factors that promote protein self-association like the capsid domain of Gag, and is modulated by pH. Despite the steady progress in defining both the viral and cellular determinants of retroviral assembly and release, Gag’s intracellular interactions and trafficking to its assembly sites in the infected cell are poorly understood. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the structural and functional role of MA in HIV replication.",assembly;Gag;matrix;myristyl;NMR;trafficking;plasma membrane

Using spectroscopic and computational approaches, we have studied structural, dynamic, and kinetic aspects of the DNA-scanning process in which Egr-1 is nonspecifically bound to DNA and perpetually changes its location on DNA. Our NMR data indicate that Egr-1 undergoes highly dynamic domain motions when scanning DNA. In particular, the zinc finger 1 (ZF1) of Egr-1 in the nonspecific complex is mainly dissociated from DNA and undergoes collective motions on a nanosecond timescale, whereas zinc fingers 2 and 3 (ZF2 and ZF3, respectively) are bound to DNA. This was totally unexpected because the previous crystallographic studies of the specific complex indicated that all of Egr-1’s three zinc fingers are equally involved in binding to a target DNA site. Mutations that are expected to enhance ZF1’s interactions with DNA and with ZF2 were found to reduce ZF1’s domain motions in the nonspecific complex suggesting that these interactions dictate the dynamic behavior of ZF1. By experiment and computation, we have also investigated kinetics of Egr-1’s translocation between two nonspecific DNA duplexes. Our data on the wild type and mutant proteins suggest that the domain dynamics facilitate Egr-1’s intersegment transfer that involves transient bridging of two DNA sites. These results shed light on asymmetrical roles of the zinc finger domains for Egr-1 to scan DNA efficiently in the nucleus.",NMR spectroscopy;target search process;interdomain dynamics;protein-DNA interactions;simulation

Stathmin family proteins play major roles during the various stages of neuronal differentiation, including axonal growth and branching, or dendritic development. We have shown previously that stathmins 2 (SCG10) and 3 (SCLIP) fulfill distinct, independent and complementary regulatory roles in axonal morphogenesis. Although the two proteins have been proposed to display the four conserved phosphorylation sites originally identified in stathmin 1, we show here that they possess distinct phosphorylation sites within their specific proline-rich domains (PRDs) that are differentially regulated by phosphorylation by proline-directed kinases involved in the control of neuronal differentiation. ERK2 or CDK5 phosphorylate the two proteins but with different site specificities. We also show for the first time that, unlike stathmin 2, stathmin 3 is a substrate for glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, stathmin 3 phosphorylated at its GSK-3β target site displays a specific subcellular localization at neuritic tips and within the actin-rich peripheral zone of the growth cone of differentiating hippocampal neurons in culture. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3β induces a redistribution of stathmin 3, but not stathmin 2, from the periphery toward the Golgi region of neurons. Stathmin proteins can thus be either regulated locally or locally targeted by specific phosphorylation, each phosphoprotein of the stathmin family fulfilling distinct and specific roles in the control of neuronal differentiation.",Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3;Microtubules;Molecular Cell Biology;Neurite Outgrowth;Neurodifferentiation;Protein Phosphorylation;Protein Targeting;Growth Cone;Proline-rich Domains;Stathmin

In humans, the UV-damaged DNA-binding protein (UV-DDB) is part of a ubiquitin E3 ligase complex (DDB1-CUL4ADDB2) that initiates NER by recognizing damaged chromatin with concomitant ubiquitination of core histones at the lesion. We report the X-ray crystal structure of the human UV-DDB in a complex with damaged DNA and show that the N-terminal domain of DDB2 makes critical contacts with two molecules of DNA, driving N-terminal-domain folding and promoting UV-DDB dimerization. The functional significance of the dimeric UV-DDB [(DDB1-DDB2)2], in a complex with damaged DNA, is validated by electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, solution biophysical, and functional analyses. We propose that the binding of UV-damaged DNA results in conformational changes in the N-terminal domain of DDB2, inducing helical folding in the context of the bound DNA and inducing dimerization as a function of nucleotide binding. The temporal and spatial interplay between domain ordering and dimerization provides an elegant molecular rationale for the unprecedented binding affinities and selectivities exhibited by UV-DDB for UV-damaged DNA. Modeling the DDB1-CUL4ADDB2 complex according to the dimeric UV-DDB-AP24 architecture results in a mechanistically consistent alignment of the E3 ligase bound to a nucleosome harboring damaged DNA. Our findings provide unique structural and conformational insights into the molecular architecture of the DDB1-CUL4ADDB2 E3 ligase, with significant implications for the regulation and overall organization of the proteins responsible for initiation of NER in the context of chromatin and for the consequent maintenance of genomic integrity.",UV damage;ubiquitin-proteosome system;X-ray crystallography

Both proteins mediate protein–protein and protein–RNA interactions for cooperative RNA-binding during spliceosome assembly. Here, we report the solution structure of a novel helix-hairpin domain in the N-terminal region of SF1 (SF1NTD). The nuclear magnetic resonance- and small-angle X-ray scattering-derived structure of a complex of the SF1NTD with the C-terminal U2AF homology motif domain of U2AF65 (U2AF65UHM) reveals that, in addition to the known U2AF65UHM–SF1 interaction, the helix-hairpin domain forms a secondary, hydrophobic interface with U2AF65UHM, which locks the orientation of the two subunits. Mutational analysis shows that the helix hairpin is essential for cooperative formation of the ternary SF1–U2AF65–RNA complex. We further show that tandem serine phosphorylation of a conserved Ser80-Pro81-Ser82-Pro83 motif rigidifies a long unstructured linker in the SF1 helix hairpin. Phosphorylation does not significantly alter the overall conformations of SF1, SF1–U2AF65 or the SF1–U2AF65–RNA complexes, but slightly enhances RNA binding. Our results indicate that the helix-hairpin domain of SF1 is required for cooperative 3′-splice site recognition presumably by stabilizing a unique quaternary arrangement of the SF1–U2AF65–RNA complex.",

This domain functions as a binding site for p53 and other DNA damage and repair proteins that contain amphipathic alpha helical domains. Here, we demonstrate direct binding of both ssDNA and the transactivation domain 2 of p53 (p53TAD2) to DBD-F, as well as DBD-F-directed dsDNA strand separation by RPA, all of which are inhibited by fumaropimaric acid (FPA). FPA binds directly to RPA, resulting in a conformational shift as determined through quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in full length RPA. Structural analogues of FPA provide insight on chemical properties that are required for inhibition. Finally, we confirm the inability of RPA possessing R41E and R43E mutations to bind to p53, destabilize dsDNA and quench tryptophan fluorescence by FPA, suggesting that protein binding, DNA modulation and inhibitor binding all occur within the same site on DBD-F. The disruption of p53–RPA interactions by FPA may disturb the regulatory functions of p53 and RPA, thereby inhibiting cellular pathways that control the cell cycle and maintain the integrity of the human genome.",

Serine proteases are one of the largest and conserved families of endopeptidases involved in diverse cellular activities including wound healing, blood coagulation and immune responses. Heteromeric α,β,γ-epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) associated with diseases like cystic fibrosis and Liddle’s syndrome, are irreversibly stimulated by membrane-anchored proteases (MAPs) and furin-like convertases. Matriptase/Channel activating protease-3 (CAP3) is one of the several MAPs that potently activate ENaC. Despite identification of protease cleavage sites, the basis for enhanced susceptibility of α- and γ-ENaC to proteases remains elusive. Here, we elucidate the energetic and structural bases for activation of ENaC by CAP3. We find a region near the γ-ENaC furin site that is previously unidentified as a critical cleavage site for CAP3-mediated stimulation. We also report that CAP3 mediates cleavage of ENaC at basic residues downstream of the furin site. Our results indicate that surface proteases alone are sufficient to fully activate uncleaved ENaC, and explain how ENaC in epithelia expressing surface-active proteases can appear refractory to soluble proteases. Our results support a model in which proteases prime ENaC for activation by cleaving at the furin site, and cleavage at downstream sites is accomplished by membrane surface proteases or extracellular soluble proteases. Based on our results, we propose a dynamics-driven “anglerfish” mechanism that explains less stringent sequence requirements for substrate recognition and cleavage by matriptase compared to furin.",ENaC;serine endopeptidase;Xenopus;voltage clamp;discrete molecular dynamics

The three parts are the inner membrane, substrate-binding transporter (or pump); a periplasmic membrane fusion protein (MFP, or adaptor); and an outer membrane-anchored channel. The fusion protein connects the transporter to the channel within the periplasmic space. One such efflux system CusCBA is responsible for extruding biocidal Cu(I) and Ag(I) ions. We previously described the crystal structures of both the inner membrane transporter CusA and the MFP CusB of Escherichia coli. We also determined the co-crystal structure of the CusBA adaptor–transporter efflux complex, showing that the transporter CusA, which is present as a trimer, interacts with six CusB protomers and that the periplasmic domain of CusA is involved in these interactions. Here, we summarize the structural information of these efflux proteins, and present the accumulated evidence that this efflux system uses methionine residues to bind and export Cu(I) and Ag(I). Genetic and structural analyses suggest that the CusA pump is capable of picking up the metal ions from both the periplasm and the cytoplasm. We propose a stepwise shuttle mechanism for this pump to export metal ions from the cell.",tripartite efflux pump;multidrug resistance;resistance-nodulation-cell division;heavy-metal efflux;CusCBA;X-ray crystallography

In our studies, we observed that two class 1 SnRK2 kinases, SnRK2.4 and SnRK2.10, are rapidly and transiently activated in Arabidopsis roots after exposure to salt. Under saline conditions, snrk2.4 knockout mutants had a reduced primary root length, while snrk2.10 mutants exhibited a reduction in the number of lateral roots. The reduced lateral root density was found to be a combinatory effect of a decrease in the number of lateral root primordia and an increase in the number of arrested lateral root primordia. The phenotypes were in agreement with the observed expression patterns of genomic yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusions of SnRK2.10 and -2.4, under control of their native promoter sequences. SnRK2.10 was found to be expressed in the vascular tissue at the base of a developing lateral root, whereas SnRK2.4 was expressed throughout the root, with higher expression in the vascular system. Salt stress triggered a rapid re-localization of SnRK2.4–YFP from the cytosol to punctate structures in root epidermal cells. Differential centrifugation experiments of isolated Arabidopsis root proteins confirmed recruitment of endogenous SnRK2.4/2.10 to membranes upon exposure to salt, supporting their observed binding affinity for the phospholipid phosphatidic acid. Together, our results reveal a role for SnRK2.4 and -2.10 in root growth and architecture in saline conditions.",salinity stress;Snf1-related protein kinase;primary root growth;lateral root emergence;cellular membrane targeting;protein kinase activity;Arabidopsis thaliana

IseA (YoeB) is a proteinaceous inhibitor against the dl-endopeptidases, peptidoglycan hydrolases. Overexpression of IseA caused significantly long chained cell morphology, because IseA inhibits the cell separation dl-endopeptidases post-translationally. Here, we report the first three-dimensional structure of IseA, determined by NMR spectroscopy. The structure includes a single domain consisting of three α-helices, one 310-helix, and eight β-strands, which is a novel fold like a “hacksaw.” Noteworthy is a dynamic loop between β4 and the 310-helix, which resembles a “blade.” The electrostatic potential distribution shows that most of the surface is positively charged, but the region around the loop is negatively charged. In contrast, the LytF active-site cleft is expected to be positively charged. NMR chemical shift perturbation of IseA interacting with LytF indicated that potential interaction sites are located around the loop. Furthermore, the IseA mutants D100K/D102K and G99P/G101P at the loop showed dramatic loss of inhibition activity against LytF, compared with wild-type IseA, indicating that the β4–310 loop plays an important role in inhibition. Moreover, we built a complex structure model of IseA-LytF by docking simulation, suggesting that the β4–310 loop of IseA gets stuck deep in the cleft of LytF, and the active site is occluded. These results suggest a novel inhibition mechanism of the hacksaw-like structure, which is different from known inhibitor proteins, through interactions around the characteristic loop regions with the active-site cleft of enzymes.",Enzyme Inhibitors;Peptidases;Peptidoglycan;Protein Structure;Protein-Protein Interactions;DL-Endopeptidase;NlpC/P60 Family;Autolysin;Inhibitor Protein;New Fold

How misfolded proteins are organized into these compartments, however, is still unknown. We have recently begun to investigate stress-inducible protein quality control (PQC) bodies in yeast cells. Surprisingly, we found that protein misfolding and aggregation were not sufficient to trigger body formation under mild heat stress conditions. Rather, compartment assembly also required the concerted action of molecular chaperones, protein-sorting factors and protein-sequestration factors, thus defining a minimal machinery for spatial PQC. Expression of this machinery was limited to times of acute stress through rapid changes in mRNA abundance and a proteasomal feedback mechanism. These findings demonstrate that yeast cells can control the amount of soluble misfolded proteins through regulated phase transitions in the cytoplasm, thus allowing them to rapidly adapt to changing environmental conditions.",Btn2;Cur1;Hsp104;Hsp40;Hsp42;IPOD;JUNQ;Sis1;amyloid;molecular chaperone;prion;proteasome;protein aggregation;protein quality control;ubiquitin

Autopsy revealed severe crescentic glomerulonephritis and massive alveolar hemorrhage. The thrombus contained abundant neutrophils. Although it is reported that patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) have an increased risk of DVT, it remains elusive why they are prone to thrombosis. A recent study has demonstrated the presence of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a newly recognized mode of neutrophil cell-death, in glomerular crescents of MPA patients. Interestingly, NETs were identified in the thrombus as well as in the glomerular crescents in the present case. When compared to other thrombi unrelated to MPA, the amount of NETs was significantly greater in the MPA patient. On the other hand, NETs are critically involved in thrombogenesis because histones within NETs can bind platelets and blood coagulants. Although this is important in regard to containment of microbes within NETs, excessive NETs could cause thrombosis. The collective findings suggest the possibility that thrombosis could be critically associated with MPA via NETs, and that NETs could be a therapeutic target in MPA patients.",MPO-ANCA;microscopic polyangiitis;neutrophil extracellular traps;deep vein thrombosis;histone-citrullination

Extensive protein-protein interaction maps have defined the organization and function of many cellular complexes, but ER complexes are under-represented. Consequently, chaperone and foldase networks in the ER are largely uncharacterized. Using complementary ER-specific methods, we have mapped interactions between ER-lumenal chaperones and foldases and describe their organization in multiprotein complexes. We identify new functional chaperone modules, including interactions between protein-disulfide isomerases and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerases. We have examined in detail a novel ERp72-cyclophilin B complex that enhances the rate of folding of immunoglobulin G. Deletion analysis and NMR reveal a conserved surface of cyclophilin B that interacts with polyacidic stretches of ERp72 and GRp94. Mutagenesis within this highly charged surface region abrogates interactions with its chaperone partners and reveals a new mechanism of ER protein-protein interaction. This ability of cyclophilin B to interact with different partners using the same molecular surface suggests that ER-chaperone/foldase partnerships may switch depending on the needs of different substrates, illustrating the flexibility of multichaperone complexes of the ER folding machinery.",

The interactions of Eukaryotic Linear Motif (iELM) web server provides a resource for predicting the function and positional interface for a subset of interactions mediated by short linear motifs (SLiMs). The iELM prediction algorithm is based on the annotated SLiM classes from the Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource and allows users to explore both annotated and user-generated PPI networks for SLiM-mediated interactions. By incorporating the annotated information from the ELM resource, iELM provides functional details of PPIs. This can be used in proteomic analysis, for example, to infer whether an interaction promotes complex formation or degradation. Furthermore, details of the molecular interface of the SLiM-mediated interactions are also predicted. This information is displayed in a fully searchable table, as well as graphically with the modular architecture of the participating proteins extracted from the UniProt and Phospho.ELM resources. A network figure is also presented to aid the interpretation of results. The iELM server supports single protein queries as well as large-scale proteomic submissions and is freely available at http://i.elm.eu.org.",

This modification generates an N-terminal threonine nucleophile that is used to hydrolyze the pantetheinyl moiety of its natural substrate. We determined the crystal structure of autoactivated ThnT to 1.8 Å through X-ray crystallography. Comparison to a mutationally inactivated precursor structure revealed several large conformational rearrangements near the active site. To probe the relevance of these transitions, we designed a pantetheine-like chloromethyl ketone inactivator and co-crystallized it with ThnT. Although this class of inhibitor has been in use for several decades, the mode of inactivation had not been determined for an enzyme that uses an N-terminal nucleophile. The co-crystal structure revealed the chloromethyl ketone bound to the N-terminal nucleophile of ThnT through an ether linkage, and analysis suggests inactivation through a direct displacement mechanism. More importantly, this inactivated complex shows that three regions of ThnT that are critical to the formation of the substrate binding pocket undergo rearrangement upon autoproteolysis. Comparison of ThnT with other autoproteolytic enzymes of disparate evolutionary lineage revealed a high degree of similarity within the proenzyme active site, reflecting shared chemical constraints. However, after autoproteolysis, many enzymes, like ThnT, are observed to rearrange in order to accommodate their specific substrate. We propose that this is a general phenomenon, whereby autoprocessing systems with shared chemistry may possess similar structural features that dissipate upon rearrangement into a mature state.",CMK;chloromethyl ketone; PβS;proteasome β‐subunit; GA;glycosylasparaginase; CA;cephalosporin acylase; HMK;halomethyl ketone; PDB;Protein Data Bank

Combined with genetic variation, prion-mediated inheritance can be channeled into prion-independent genomic inheritance. Latest screening shows that prions are common, at least in fungi. Thus, there is non-negligible flow of information from proteins to the genome in modern cells, in a direct violation of the Central Dogma of molecular biology. The prion-mediated heredity that violates the Central Dogma appears to be a specific, most radical manifestation of the widespread assimilation of protein (epigenetic) variation into genetic variation. The epigenetic variation precedes and facilitates genetic adaptation through a general ‘look-ahead effect’ of phenotypic mutations. This direction of the information flow is likely to be one of the important routes of environment-genome interaction and could substantially contribute to the evolution of complex adaptive traits.",

Despite their diverse functions, PAS domains share a conserved structure. It has been suggested that the structure of PAS domains is flexible and thus adaptable to many binding partners. However, direct measurement of the flexibility of PAS domains has not yet been provided. Here, we quantitatively measure the mechanical unfolding of a PAS domain, ARNT PAS-B, using single-molecule atomic force microscopy. Our force spectroscopy results indicate that the structure of ARNT PAS-B can be unraveled under mechanical forces as low as ∼30 pN due to its broad potential well for the mechanical unfolding transition of ∼2 nm. This allows the PAS-B domain to extend by up to 75% of its resting end-to-end distance without unfolding. Moreover, we found that the ARNT PAS-B domain unfolds in two distinct pathways via a kinetic partitioning mechanism. Sixty-seven percent of ARNT PAS-B unfolds through a simple two-state pathway, whereas the other 33% unfolds with a well-defined intermediate state in which the C-terminal β-hairpin is detached. We propose that the structural flexibility and force-induced partial unfolding of PAS-B domains may provide a unique mechanism for them to recruit diverse binding partners and lower the free-energy barrier for the formation of the binding interface.",

Therefore, establishing a method for synthesizing the antigens is important for functional glycomics studies. However, regiospecific synthesis of glycosyl linkages, especially α-l-fucosyl linkages, is quite difficult to control both by chemists and enzymologists. Here, we generated an α-l-fucosynthase that specifically introduces Lea and Lex antigens into the type-1 and type-2 chains, respectively; i.e. the enzyme specifically accepts the disaccharide structures (Galβ1–3/4GlcNAc) at the non-reducing ends and attaches a Fuc residue via an α-(1,4/3)-linkage to the GlcNAc. X-ray crystallographic studies revealed the structural basis of this strict regio- and acceptor specificity, which includes the induced fit movement of the catalytically important residues, and the difference between the active site structures of 1,3-1,4-α-l-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.111) and α-l-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51) in glycoside hydrolase family 29.

Pharmaceutical formulations are ordinarily protected from such degradation by sequestration of the susceptible monomer within native protein assemblies. With respect to the safety and efficacy of insulin pumps, however, this strategy imposes an intrinsic trade-off between pharmacokinetic goals (rapid absorption and clearance) and the requisite physical properties of a formulation (prolonged shelf life and stability within the reservoir). Available rapid-acting formulations are suboptimal in both respects; susceptibility to fibrillation is exacerbated even as absorption is delayed relative to the ideal specifications of a closed-loop system. To circumvent this molecular trade-off, we exploited structural models of insulin fibrils and amyloidogenic intermediates to define an alternative protective mechanism. Single-chain insulin (SCI) analogs were shown to be refractory to thermal fibrillation with maintenance of biological activity for more than 3 months under conditions that promote the rapid fibrillation and inactivation of insulin. The essential idea exploits an intrinsic incompatibility between SCI topology and the geometry of cross-b assembly. A peptide tether was thus interposed between the A- and B-chains whose length was (a) sufficiently long to provide the “play” needed for induced fit of the hormone on receptor binding and yet (b) sufficiently short to impose a topological barrier to fibrillation. Our findings suggest that ultrastable monomeric SCI analogs may be formulated without protective self-assembly and so permit simultaneous optimization of pharmacokinetics and reservoir life.",amyloid;closed-loop system;insulin pump;intraperitoneal pump;pump reservoir

The CyaA toxin is able to invade eukaryotic cells by translocating its N-terminal catalytic domain directly across the plasma membrane of the target cells, where, activated by endogenous calmodulin, it produces supraphysiological levels of cAMP. How the catalytic domain is transferred from the hydrophilic extracellular medium into the hydrophobic environment of the membrane and then to the cell cytoplasm remains an unsolved question. In this report, we have characterized the membrane-interacting properties of the CyaA catalytic domain. We showed that a protein covering the catalytic domain (AC384, encompassing residues 1–384 of CyaA) displayed no membrane association propensity. However, a longer polypeptide (AC489), encompassing residues 1–489 of CyaA, exhibited the intrinsic property to bind to membranes and to induce lipid bilayer destabilization. We further showed that deletion of residues 375–485 within CyaA totally abrogated the toxin's ability to increase intracellular cAMP in target cells. These results indicate that, whereas the calmodulin dependent enzymatic domain is restricted to the amino-terminal residues 1–384 of CyaA, the membrane-interacting, translocation-competent domain extends up to residue 489. This thus suggests an important role of the region adjacent to the catalytic domain of CyaA in promoting its interaction with and its translocation across the plasma membrane of target cells.",Adenylate Cyclase (Adenylyl Cyclase);Bacterial Toxins;Lipid-binding Protein;Membrane Bilayer;Neutron Scattering;Protein Translocation;Bordetella pertussis;Amphitropic Proteins;Dual Polarization Interferometry;Permeabilization

Menin interacts with a multitude of proteins and involves in a variety of cellular processes2–6. Menin binds the Jun family transcription factor JunD and inhibits its transcriptional activity7,8. Several MEN1 missense mutations disrupted the menin-JunD interaction suggestive of a correlation between menin’s tumor suppressor function and its interaction with JunD and suppression of JunD activated transcription8,9. Menin also interacts with mixed lineage leukemia protein 1 MLL1, a histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase, and functions as an oncogenic cofactor to upregulate gene (including HOX genes) transcription and promote MLL1 fusion protein (MFP)-induced leukemogenesis10–12. A recent report on menin tethering MLL1 to chromatin binding factor LEDGF indicates menin as a molecular adaptor to coordinate the functions of multiple proteins13. Despite the importance of menin, it still remains poorly understood how menin could interact with many distinct partners and control multiple functions. Here we present the crystal structures of menin, free and in complexes with MLL1 or JunD, or an MLL1-LEDGF heterodimer. These structures show that menin contains a deep pocket that binds short peptides of MLL1 or JunD in the same manner, but oppositely regulates transcription. The menin-JunD interaction blocks JNK kinase-meidated JunD phosphorylation, a crucial event for JunD activation.Moreover, menin functions as a scaffold molecule to promote gene transcription by binding MLL1 through the peptide-pocket yet interacting with LEDGF at a distinct surface.",

The most significant observation when the P. falciparum C subunit is compared to mammalian C isoforms is lack of phosphorylation at a key site tail implying that parasite kinase activity is not regulated so tightly as mammalian PKA.

Many of these models were developed in parallel and iteratively with experimental studies and provided predictions guiding new experiments. This data-driven modeling approach has advanced our understanding of respiratory network architecture and neural mechanisms underlying generation of the respiratory rhythm and pattern, including their functional reorganization under different physiological conditions. Models reviewed here vary in neurobiological details and computational complexity and span multiple spatiotemporal scales of respiratory control mechanisms. Recent models describe interacting populations of respiratory neurons spatially distributed within the Bötzinger and pre-Bötzinger complexes and rostral ventrolateral medulla that contain core circuits of the respiratory central pattern generator (CPG). Network interactions within these circuits along with intrinsic rhythmogenic properties of neurons form a hierarchy of multiple rhythm generation mechanisms. The functional expression of these mechanisms is controlled by input drives from other brainstem components, including the retrotrapezoid nucleus and pons, which regulate the dynamic behavior of the core circuitry. The emerging view is that the brainstem respiratory network has rhythmogenic capabilities at multiple levels of circuit organization. This allows flexible, state-dependent expression of different neural pattern-generation mechanisms under various physiological conditions, enabling a wide repertoire of respiratory behaviors. Some models consider control of the respiratory CPG by pulmonary feedback and network reconfiguration during defensive behaviors such as cough. Future directions in modeling of the respiratory CPG are considered.",

The effects of DNA binding and the truncation of the DNA-binding domain on the CO geminate recombination kinetics were specifically investigated. The CO rebinding kinetics in these CooA complexes take place on ultrafast time scales but remain non-exponential over many decades in time. We show that this non-exponential kinetic response is due to a quenched enthalpic barrier distribution resulting from a distribution of heme geometries that is frozen or slowly evolving on the time scale of CO rebinding. We also show that, upon CO binding, the distal pocket of the heme in the CooA proteins relaxes to form a very efficient hydrophobic trap for CO. DNA binding further tightens the narrow distal pocket and slightly weakens the iron-proximal histidine bond. Comparison of the CO rebinding kinetics of RrCooA, truncated RrCooA, and DNA-bound RrCooA proteins reveals that the uncomplexed and inherently flexible DNA-binding domain adds additional structural heterogeneity to the heme doming coordinate. When CooA forms a complex with DNA, the flexibility of the DNA-binding domain decreases, and the distribution of the conformations available in the heme domain becomes restricted. The kinetic studies also offer insights into how the architecture of the heme environment can tune entropic barriers in order to control the geminate recombination of CO in heme proteins, whereas spin selection rules play a minor or non-existent role.",Allosteric Regulation;DNA-Protein Interaction;Heme;Kinetics;Transcription Regulation;CooA;Transcription Factors;Allostery;Ligand Recognition;Protein Conformations;Entropy

Mutations that inactivate GK are linked to diabetes, and mutations that activate it are associated with hypoglycemia. Unique kinetic properties equip GK for its regulatory role: although it has weak basal affinity for glucose, positive cooperativity in its binding of glucose causes a rapid increase in catalytic activity when plasma glucose concentrations rise above euglycemic levels. In clinical trials, small molecule GK activators (GKAs) have been efficacious in lowering plasma glucose and enhancing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, but they carry a risk of overly activating GK and causing hypoglycemia. The theoretical models proposed to date attribute the positive cooperativity of GK to the existence of distinct protein conformations that interconvert slowly and exhibit different affinities for glucose. Here we report the respective crystal structures of the catalytic complex of GK and of a GK-glucose complex in a wide open conformation. To assess conformations of GK in solution, we also carried out small angle x-ray scattering experiments. The results showed that glucose dose-dependently converts GK from an apo conformation to an active open conformation. Compared with wild type GK, activating mutants required notably lower concentrations of glucose to be converted to the active open conformation. GKAs decreased the level of glucose required for GK activation, and different compounds demonstrated distinct activation profiles. These results lead us to propose a modified mnemonic model to explain cooperativity in GK. Our findings may offer new approaches for designing GKAs with reduced hypoglycemic risk.",Allosteric Regulation;Enzyme Kinetics;Glucokinase;Glucose Metabolism;X-ray Crystallography;X-ray Scattering

Doucleff, National Public Radio, Washington, DC 20001","The σ subunits of bacterial RNA polymerase occur in many variant forms, and confer promoter specificity to the holopolymerase. Members of the σ54 family of σ subunits require the action of a ‘transcriptional activator’ protein to open the promoter and initiate transcription. The activator proteins undergo regulated assembly from inactive dimers to hexamers that are active ATPases. These contact σ54 directly and, through ATP hydrolysis, drive a conformational change that enables promoter opening. σ54 activators use several different kinds of regulatory domains to respond to a wide variety of intracellular signals. One common regulatory module, the GAF domain, is used by σ54 activators to sensesmall molecule ligands. The structural basis for GAF-domain regulation in σ54 activators has not previously been reported. Here, we present crystal structures of GAF regulatory domains for Aquifex aeolicus σ54 activators Nlh2 and Nlh1 in three functional states – an ‘open’, ATPase inactive state; a ‘closed’, ATPase inactive state; and a ‘closed’, ligand-bound, active ATPase state. We also present small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) dataforNlh2 linked GAF-ATPase domains in the inactive state. These GAF domain dimers regulate σ54 activator proteins by holding the ATPase domains in an inactive dimer conformation. Ligand binding of Nlh1 dramatically remodels the GAF domain dimer interface, disrupting the contacts with the ATPase domains. This mechanism has strong parallels to the response to phosphorylation in some two-component regulated σ54 activators. We describe a structural mechanism of GAF-mediated enzyme regulation that appears to be conserved among humans, plants, and bacteria.",transcriptional activator;sigma-54;enhancer-binding protein;structural activation mechanism;signal transduction

Upon binding phosphatidylinositol 4,5‐bisphosphate, the N-terminal helix (H0) of the ENTH domain becomes structured and aids in the aggregation of ENTH domains, which results in extensive membrane remodeling. In this article, atomistic and coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to investigate the structure and the stability of ENTH domain aggregates on lipid bilayers. EPR experiments are also reported for systems composed of different ENTH-bound membrane morphologies, including membrane vesicles as well as preformed membrane tubules. The EPR data are used to help develop a molecular model of ENTH domain aggregates on preformed lipid tubules that are then studied by CG MD simulation. The combined computational and experimental approach suggests that ENTH domains exist predominantly as monomers on vesiculated structures, while ENTH domains self-associate into dimeric structures and even higher‐order oligomers on the membrane tubes. The results emphasize that the arrangement of ENTH domain aggregates depends strongly on whether the local membrane curvature is isotropic or anisotropic. The molecular mechanism of ENTH‐domain-induced membrane vesiculation and tubulation and the implications of the epsin's role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis resulting from the interplay between ENTH domain membrane binding and ENTH domain self-association are also discussed.",ENTH;epsin N-terminal homology; PIP2;phosphatidylinositol 4;5-bisphosphate; CG;coarse-grained; MD;molecular dynamics; CME;clathrin-mediated endocytosis; N-BAR;N-terminal Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs-homology; EM;electron microscopy; HAS;hybrid analytical systematic; PMF;potential of mean force; RT;room temperature

Important information about the interaction of the proteins with CHO-K1 cells was obtained by monitoring the diminution of 19F resonances of 3-fluoro-L-tyrosine labeled proteins. For α-synuclein, a decrease in the resonance from position 39 was observed indicating that only the N-terminal third region of the protein interacts with plasma membrane. However, when the fusion construct was incubated with the cells, a decrease in the resonance from the fusion peptide region was noted with no change in the resonances from α-synuclein region. Longer incubation, studied by using confocal fluorescence microscopy, revealed that the fusion construct translocates into the cells, but α-synuclein alone did not cross the membrane in significant amounts.",cell-penetrating peptide;delivery system;eukaryotic cell;19F NMR;α-synuclein

It both up-regulates genes that maintain a proliferative, immature neural ectoderm and down-regulates genes that promote the transition to a differentiating neural plate. We constructed deletion and mutant versions of FoxD4/5 to determine which domains are functionally responsible for these opposite activities, which regulate the critical developmental transition of neural precursors to neural progenitors to differentiating neural plate cells. Our results show that up-regulation of genes that maintain immature neural precursors (gem, zic2) requires the Acidic blob (AB) region in the N-terminal portion of the protein, indicating that the AB is the transactivating domain. Additionally, down-regulation of those genes that promote the transition to neural progenitors (sox) and those that lead to neural differentiation (zic, irx) involves: 1) an interaction with the Groucho co-repressor at the Eh-1 motif in the C-terminus; and 2) sequence downstream of this motif. Finally, the ability of FoxD4/5 to induce the ectopic expression of neural precursor genes in the ventral ectoderm also involves both the AB region and the Eh-1 motif; FoxD4/5 accomplishes ectopic neural induction by both activating neural precursor genes and repressing BMP signaling and epidermal genes. This study identifies the specific, conserved domains of the FoxD4/5 protein that allow this single transcription factor to regulate a network of genes that controls the transition of a proliferative neural ectodermal population to a committed neural plate population poised to begin differentiation.",Neural induction;sox2;sox3;sox11;soxD;zic2;zic1;zic3;irx1;irx2;irx3;Transcription;foxD4;foxD4L1

The understanding of such evolutionary differences provides mechanistic insights into genotype-phenotype correlations underpinning biological processes across metazoans. The pioneering work developed by the William Pak laboratory for the past four decades, and the work of others, epitomize the notion of how the Drosophila system breaks new fertile ground or complements research fields of high scientific and medical relevance. Among the three major genetic complementation groups produced by the Pak's laboratory and impairing distinct facets of photoreceptor neuronal function, the nina group (ninaA….J) selectively affects the biogenesis of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) mediating the photoconversion and transduction of light-stimuli. Among the nina genes identified, ninaA arguably assumes heightened significance for several reasons. First, it presents unique physiological selectivity toward the biogenesis of a subset of GPCRs, a standalone biological manifestation yet to be discerned for most mammalian homologues of NinaA. Second, NinaA belongs to a family of proteins, immunophilins, which are the primary targets for immunosuppressive drugs at the therapeutic forefront of a multitude of medical conditions. Third, NinaA closest homologue, cyclophilin-B (CyPB/PPIB), is an immunophilin whose loss-of-function was found recently to cause osteogenesis imperfecta in the human. This report highlights advances made by studies on some members of immunophilins, the cyclophilins. Finally, it re-examines critically data and dogmas derived from past and recent genetic, structural, biological and pathological studies on NinaA and few other cyclophilins that support some of such paradigms to be less than definite and advance our understanding of cyclophilins' roles in cell function, disease and therapeutic interventions.",ninaA;cyclophilin;chaperone;proly isomerase;cyclosporine A (CsA);immunophilin;protein biogenesis

A large group of +TIPs contain a short linear motif, SXIP, which is essential for them to bind to end-binding proteins (EBs) and target microtubule ends. The SXIP sequence site thus acts as a widespread microtubule tip localization signal (MtLS). Here we have analyzed the sequence-function relationship of a canonical MtLS. Using synthetic peptide arrays on membrane supports, we identified the residue preferences at each amino acid position of the SXIP motif and its surrounding sequence with respect to EB binding.

To date, molecular structures of three dystrophin domains have been determined, of which the N-terminal actin-binding domain (N-ABD or ABD1) is of particular interest. This domain is composed of two calponin-homology (CH) domains, which form an important class of ABDs in muscle proteins. A previously determined x-ray structure indicates that the dystrophin N-ABD is a domain-swapped dimer, with each monomer adopting an extended, open conformation in which the two CH domains do not interact. This structure is controversial because it contradicts functional studies and known structures of similar ABDs from other muscle proteins. Here, we investigated the solution conformation of the dystrophin N-ABD using a very simple and elegant technique of pyrene excimer fluorescence. Using the wild-type protein, which contains two cysteines, and the corresponding single-cysteine mutants, we show that the protein is a monomer in solution and is in a closed conformation in which the two CH domains seem to interact, as observed from the excimer fluorescence of pyrene-labeled wild-type protein.

In about half of human cancers, p53 is inactivated directly through mutation in its sequence-specific DNA-binding domain. Drosophila p53 (Dmp53) has similar apoptotic functions as its human homolog and is therefore an attractive model system for studying cancer pathways. To probe the structure and function of Dmp53, we studied the effect of point mutations, corresponding to cancer hot spot mutations in human p53 (Hp53), on the stability and DNA binding affinity of the full-length protein. Despite low sequence conservation, the Hp53 and Dmp53 proteins had a similar melting temperature and generally showed a similar energetic and functional response to cancer-associated mutations. We also found a correlation between the thermodynamic stability of the mutant proteins and their rate of aggregation. The effects of the mutations were rationalized based on homology modeling of the Dmp53 DNA-binding domain, suggesting that the drastically different effects of a cancer mutation in the loop-sheet-helix motif (R282W in Hp53 and R268W in Dmp53) on stability and DNA binding affinity of the two proteins are related to conformational differences in the L1 loop adjacent to the mutation site. On the basis of these data, we discuss the advantages and limitations of using Dmp53 as a model system for studying p53 function and testing p53 rescue drugs.",Cancer;Drosophila;p53;Protein Misfolding;Protein Stability;Conformational

","All mammalian cells express three closely related Ras proteins: H-Ras, K-Ras and N-Ras that promote oncogenesis when mutationally activated at codons 12, 13 or 61. Despite a high degree of similarity between the isoforms, K-Ras mutations are far more frequently observed in cancer and each isoform displays preferential coupling to particular cancer types. We have examined the mutation spectra of Ras isoforms curated from large-scale tumour profiling and found that each isoform exhibits surprisingly distinctive codon mutation and amino acid substitution biases. These were unexpected given that these mutations occur in regions that share 100% amino acid sequence identity between the three isoforms. Importantly, many of the mutational biases were not due to differences in exposure to mutagens because the patterns were still evident when compared within specific cancer types. We discuss potential genetic and epigenetic mechanisms together with isoform-specific differences in protein structure and signalling that may promote these distinct mutation patterns and differential coupling to specific cancers.",HRAS;KRAS;NRAS;GTPase;mutagenesis;mutation hotspot

It is the most abundant protein in plasma with a typical concentration of 5 g/100 mL and the principal transporter of fatty acids in plasma. While the crystal structures of human serum albumin (HSA) free and in complex with fatty acids, hemin, and local anesthetics have been characterized, no crystallographic models are available on bovine serum albumin (BSA), presumably because of the poor diffraction power of existing hexagonal BSA crystals. Here, the crystallization and diffraction data of a new BSA crystal form, obtained by the hanging drop method using MPEG 5K as precipitating agent, are presented. The crystals belong to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 216.45 Å, b = 44.72 Å, c = 140.18 Å, β = 114.5°. Dehydration was found to increase the diffraction limit of BSA crystals from ~8 Å to 3.2 Å, probably by improving the packing of protein molecules in the crystal lattice. These results, together with a survey of more than 60 successful cases of protein crystal dehydration, confirm that it can be a useful procedure to be used in initial screening as a method of improving the diffraction limits of existing crystals.",serum albumin;protein crystallization;crystal dehydration;crystal quality;X-ray crystallography;post-crystallization treatment

REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 1 (ROS1) is a prototype member of a family of plant 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylases that initiate active DNA demethylation through a base excision repair pathway. As ROS1 binds DNA non-specifically, we have critically tested the hypothesis that facilitated diffusion along DNA may contribute to target location by the enzyme. We have found that dissociation of ROS1 from DNA is severely restricted when access to both ends is obstructed by tetraloops obstacles. Unblocking any end facilitates protein dissociation, suggesting that random surface sliding is the main route to a specific target site. We also found that removal of the basic N-terminal domain of ROS1 significantly impairs the sliding capacity of the protein. Finally, we show that sliding increases the catalytic efficiency of ROS1 on 5-meC:G pairs, but not on T:G mispairs, thus suggesting that the enzyme achieves recognition and excision of its two substrate bases by different means. A model is proposed to explain how ROS1 finds its potential targets on DNA.",

WNV causes sporadic disease outbreaks in horses and humans, which may result in febrile illness, meningitis, encephalitis and flaccid paralysis. Until recently, its medical and veterinary health concern was relatively low; however, the number, frequency and severity of outbreaks with neurological consequences in humans and horses have lately increased in Europe and the Mediterranean basin. Since its introduction in the Americas, the virus spread across the continent with worrisome consequences in bird mortality and a considerable number of outbreaks among humans and horses, which have resulted in the largest epidemics of neuroinvasive WNV disease ever documented. Surprisingly, its incidence in human and animal health is very different in Central and South America, and the reasons for it are not yet understood. Even though great advances have been obtained lately regarding WNV infection, and although efficient equine vaccines are available, no specific treatments or vaccines for human use are on the market. This review updates the most recent investigations in different aspects of WNV life cycle: molecular virology, transmission dynamics, host range, clinical presentations, epidemiology, ecology, diagnosis, control, and prevention, and highlights some aspects that certainly require further research.",West Nile virus;Emerging pathogen;Molecular biology;Diagnosis;Pathology;Epidemiology;Vaccines;Antivirals

Its' only known function is the regulation of ryanodine receptor (RyR) intracellular Ca2+ release channels. These RyR proteins play a major role in the regulation of Ca2+ signaling in many cells. Utilizing exome capture and deep sequencing of genes on the X-chromosome, we have identified a mutation in CLIC2 (c.303C>G, p.H101Q) which is associated with X-linked intellectual disability (ID), atrial fibrillation, cardiomegaly, congestive heart failure (CHF), some somatic features and seizures. Functional studies of the H101Q variant indicated that it stimulated rather than inhibited the action of RyR channels, with channels remaining open for longer times and potentially amplifying Ca2+ signals dependent on RyR channel activity. The overly active RyRs in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells and neuronal cells would result in abnormal cardiac function and trigger post-synaptic pathways and neurotransmitter release. The presence of both cardiomegaly and CHF in the two affected males and atrial fibrillation in one are consistent with abnormal RyR2 channel function. Since the dysfunction of RyR2 channels in the brain via ‘leaky mutations’ can result in mild developmental delay and seizures, our data also suggest a vital role for the CLIC2 protein in maintaining normal cognitive function via its interaction with RyRs in the brain. Therefore, our patients appear to suffer from a new channelopathy comprised of ID, seizures and cardiac problems because of enhanced Ca2+ release through RyRs in neuronal cells and cardiac muscle cells.",

The SRA RNA is a non-coding RNA that coactivates several human sex hormone receptors and is strongly associated with breast cancer. Coding isoforms of SRA are also expressed to produce proteins, making the SRA gene a unique bifunctional system. Our experimental findings (SHAPE, in-line, DMS and RNase V1 probing) reveal that this lncRNA has a complex structural organization, consisting of four domains, with a variety of secondary structure elements. We examine the coevolution of the SRA gene at the RNA structure and protein structure levels using comparative sequence analysis across vertebrates. Rapid evolutionary stabilization of RNA structure, combined with frame-disrupting mutations in conserved regions, suggests that evolutionary pressure preserves the RNA structural core rather than its translational product.

During visual excitation, interaction of activated transducin with Pγ relieves inhibition. Pγ also participates in a complex with RGS9–1 and other proteins to accelerate the GTPase activity of activated transducin. We studied the structural determinants for these important functions of Pγ. First, we identified two important sites in the middle region of Pγ (amino acids 27–38 and 52–54) that significantly stabilize the overall binding affinity of Pγ with Pαβ. The ability of Pγ to stimulate noncatalytic cGMP binding to the GAF domains of PDE6 has been localized to amino acids 27–30 of Pγ. Transducin activation of PDE6 catalysis critically depends on the presence of Ile54 in the glycine-rich region of Pγ in order to relieve inhibition of catalysis. The central glycine-rich region of Pγ is also required for transducin to increase cGMP exchange at the GAF domains. Finally, Thr-65 and/or Val-66 of Pγ are critical residues for Pγ to stimulate GTPase activity of transducin in a complex with RGS9–1. We propose that the glycine-rich region of Pγ is a primary docking site for PDE6-interacting proteins involved in the activation/inactivation pathways of visual transduction.

Genetic and environmental insults lead to neurodevelopmental disorders which encompass a large group of diseases that result from anatomical and physiological abnormalities during maturation and development of brain circuits. Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurological disorder of genetic origin, caused by mutations in the X-linked gene methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). It features a range of neuropsychiatric abnormalities including motor dysfunctions and mild to severe cognitive impairment. Here, we discuss key questions and recent studies describing animal models, cell-type specific functions of methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), defects in neural circuit plasticity, and attempts to evaluate possible therapeutic strategies for RTT. We also discuss how genes, proteins, and overlapping signaling pathways affect the molecular etiology of apparently unrelated neuropsychiatric disorders, an understanding of which can offer novel therapeutic strategies for a range of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).",RTT;visual cortex;synapse;plasticity;development

At G1/S, there is an abrupt switch from a state of high cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) inhibitor (CKI) levels and low S-phase CDK activity to a state of high S-phase CDK activity and degraded CKI. In budding yeast, this transition is triggered by phosphorylation of the Cdk1 inhibitor Sic1 at multiple sites by G1-phase CDK (Cln1,2-Cdk1) and S-phase CDK (Clb5,6-Cdk1) complexes. Using mathematical modeling we demonstrate that the mechanistic basis for the abruptness of the G1/S transition is the highly specific phosphorylation of Sic1 by S-phase CDK complex. This switch is generated by a double-negative feedback loop in which S-CDK1 phosphorylates Sic1, thus targeting it for destruction, and thereby liberating further S-CDK1 from the inhibitory Sic1-S-CDK1 complex. Our model predicts that the abruptness of the switch depends upon a strong binding affinity within the Sic1-S-CDK inhibitory complex. In vitro phosphorylation analysis using purified yeast proteins revealed that free Clb5-Cdk1 can create positive feedback by phosphorylating Sic1 that is bound in the inhibitory complex, and that Sic1 inhibits Clb5-Cdk1 with a sub-nanomolar inhibition constant. Our model also predicts that if the G1-phase CDK complex is too efficient at targeting Sic1 for destruction, then G1/S becomes a smooth and readily reversible transition. We propose that the optimal role for the G1-phase CDK in the switch would not be to act as a kinase activity directly responsible for abrupt degradation of CKI, but rather to act as a priming signal that initiates a positive feedback loop driven by emerging free S-phase CDK.",Cdk1;CDK;CKI;cyclin-dependent kinases;Sic1;G1/S;switch;cell cycle

from interactions among molecules like amphipathic lipids, polysaccharides,
cholesterol, proteins, and water. Since the chemical and physical
properties of these molecules differ considerably, the minimum free
energy of mixing corresponds to a heterogeneous cell membrane. Domains
rich in protein, cholesterol and anionic lipids, and rafts have been
reported to play important roles in biological activities of cells
which have direct implications in viral infection, bacterial infection,
amyloid toxicity related to aging diseases, and cancer.11−13 For example, the presence of charged lipids in bacterial cell membranes
and their absence in mammalian cell membranes are one of the key factors
in the selectivity of antimicrobial peptides. Likewise, cholesterol
present in mammalian and absent in bacterial cell membranes has been
shown to have a similar influence on the selectivity of antimicrobial
peptides.14 In addition, the process of
folding, misfolding or refolding, and aggregation of amyloidogenic
proteins in cell membranes is different from that in solution, and
also depends on the composition of the cell membrane.15 Needless to mention that the secondary and tertiary structures
of proteins can be different when they associate with the cell membrane.
Therefore, high-resolution structure of individual molecules and their
orientation in a membrane environment could reveal the factors that
drive the molecular association and their function in this heterogeneous
membrane environment. While solving the atomic-level structure of
a membrane protein still remains a big challenge for most biophysical
techniques, the increasing number of structures determined by X-ray
and NMR studies continue to shed light on the functional aspects of
membrane proteins. For example, the reported high-resolution structure
of the potassium channel forming membrane protein16−18 has provided
insights into the geometry of the channel, ion selectivity, interactions
between lipids and the protein, and the role of individual amino acids

Here we report multiple structures revealing that the P-loop motif exhibits a remarkable “in-out” conformational equilibrium, which allows access to Ser150 and its intermolecular autophosphorylation. Phosphorylated Ser150 stabilizes the “out-state”, which inactivates the kinase by disrupting the ATP binding pocket.

The use of this pathway often results in somatic mutations that can drive carcinogenesis. Rev1 is a TLS polymerase found in all eukaryotes that plays a pivotal role in mediating DNA-damage induced mutagenesis. It possesses a BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domain that is required for its function. The rev1-1 allele encodes a mutant form of Rev1 with a G193R substitution in this domain, which reduces DNA damage-induced mutagenesis. Despite its clear importance in mutagenic TLS, the role of the BRCT domain is unknown. Here, we report the X-ray crystal structure of the yeast Rev1 BRCT domain and show that substitutions in residues constituting its phosphate-binding pocket do not affect mutagenic TLS. This suggests that the role of the Rev1 BRCT domain is not to recognize phosphate groups on protein binding partners or on DNA. We also found that the G193 residue is located in a conserved turn region of the BRCT domain, and our in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that the G193R substitution may disrupt Rev1 function by destabilizing the fold of the BRCT domain.",

Mutations at dozens of sites in SOD1 are known to cause a fatal motor neuron disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and recent experiments implicate the unfolded state as a source of soluble oligomers and histologically observable aggregates thought to be responsible for toxicity. To determine the thermodynamic properties of the transition state ensemble (TSE) limiting the folding of this high contact order β-sandwich motif, a combined thermal/urea denaturation thermodynamic/kinetic analysis was performed. The barriers to folding and unfolding are dominated by the activation enthalpy at 298 K and neutral pH; the activation entropy is favorable and reduces the barrier height for both reactions. The absence of secondary structure formation or large-scale chain collapse prior to crossing the barrier for folding led to the conclusion that dehydration of nonpolar surfaces in the TSE is responsible for the large and positive activation enthalpy. Although the activation entropy favors the folding reaction, the transition from the unfolded state to the native state is entropically disfavored at 298 K. The opposing entropic contributions to the free energies of the TSE and the native state during folding provide insights into structural properties of the TSE. The results also imply a crucial role for water in governing the productive folding reaction and enhancing the propensity for the aggregation of SOD1.",Protein folding;enthalpy;entropy;heat capacity;enthalpy-entropy compensation

Ligated VDR in complex with retinoid X receptor (RXR) binds to regulatory regions of 1,25(OH)2D-target genes. 1,25(OH)2D is able to induce differentiation of leukemic blasts towards macrophage-like cells. Many different acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines respond to 1,25(OH)2D by increasing CD14 cell surface receptor, some additionally upregulate CD11b and CD11c integrins. In untreated AML cells VDR protein is present in cytosol at a very low level, even though its mRNA is continuously expressed. Ligation of VDR causes protein stabilization and translocation to the cell nuclei, where it regulates transcription of target genes. Several important groups of genes are regulated by 1,25(OH)2D in HL60 cells. These genes include differentiation-related genes involved in macrophage function, as well as a gene regulating degradation of 1,25(OH)2D, namely CYP24A1.

Human DJ-1 contains a functionally essential cysteine residue (Cys106) whose oxidation is important for regulating protein function by an unknown mechanism. This residue is well conserved in other DJ-1 homologues, including two (DJ-1α and DJ-1β) in Drosophila melanogaster. Because D. melanogaster is a powerful model system for studying DJ-1 function, we have determined the crystal structure and impact of cysteine oxidation on Drosophila DJ-1β. The structure of D. melanogaster DJ-1β is similar to that of human DJ-1, although two important residues in the human protein, Met26 and His126, are not conserved in DJ-1β. His126 in human DJ-1 is substituted with a tyrosine in DJ-1β, and this residue is not able to compose a putative catalytic dyad with Cys106 that was proposed to be important in the human protein. The reactive cysteine in DJ-1 is oxidized readily to the cysteine-sulfinic acid in both flies and humans and this may regulate the cytoprotective function of the protein. We show that the oxidation of this conserved cysteine residue to its sulfinate form (Cys-SO2−) results in considerable thermal stabilization of both Drosophila DJ-1β and human DJ-1. Therefore, protein stabilization is one potential mechanism by which cysteine oxidation may regulate DJ-1 function in vivo. More generally, most close DJ-1 homologues are likely stabilized by cysteine-sulfinic acid formation but destabilized by further oxidation, suggesting that they are biphasically regulated by oxidative modification.",DJ-1;cysteine oxidation;X-ray crystallography;Parkinson’s disease;protein stability

Combining tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we identified a number of mRNA processing factors that bind to a soluble recombinant Mediator subunit MED23 but not to several other Mediator components. One of these factors, hnRNP L, specifically interacts with MED23 in vitro and in vivo. Consistently, Mediator partially colocalizes with hnRNP L and the splicing machinery in the cell. Functionally Med23 regulates a subset of hnRNP L-targeted alternative splicing (AS) and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) events as shown by minigene reporters and exon array analysis. ChIP-seq analysis revealed that Med23 can regulate hnRNP L occupancy at their co-regulated genes. Taken together, these results demonstrate a crosstalk between Mediator and the splicing machinery, providing a molecular basis for coupling mRNA processing to transcription.",

The ZnF plays a pivotal role in the architecture of the whole assembly. UV-induced crosslinking of Cwc2–U6 snRNA allowed the identification by mass spectrometry of six RNA-contacting sites: four in or close to the RRM domain, one in the ZnF and one on a protruding element connecting the Torus and RRM domains. The three distinct regions contacting RNA are connected by a contiguous and conserved positively charged surface, suggesting an expanded interface for RNA accommodation. Cwc2 mutations confirmed that the connector element plays a crucial role in splicing.

However, too much p53 is not beneficial to cells and causes lethality. At the steady state, p53 activity needs to be leashed for cell survival. Early studies suggested that the MDM2 oncoprotein negatively regulates p53 activity through the induction of p53 protein degradation. MDM2 serves as an E3 ubiquitin ligase of p53; it catalyzes polyubiquitination and subsequently induces proteasome degradation to downregulate p53 protein level. However, the mechanism by which MDM2 represses p53 is not a single mode. Emerging evidence reveals another cellular location of MDM2-p53 interaction. MDM2 is recruited to chromatin, specifically the p53 responsive promoter regions, in a p53 dependent manner. MDM2 is proposed to directly inhibit p53 transactivity at chromatin. This article provides an overview of the mechanism by which p53 is repressed by MDM2 in both ubiquitination dependent and ubiquitination independent pathways.",MDM2;ubiquitination dependent;ubiquitination independent;antirepression model

The protein αSynuclein is a central component in PD pathogenesis yet its cellular targets and mechanism of toxicity remains unknown. Mitochondrial dysfunction is also a common theme in PD patients and this review explores the strong possibility that αSynuclein and mitochondrial dysfunction have an inter-relationship responsible for underlying the disease pathology. Amplifying cycles of mitochondrial dysfunction and αSynuclein toxicity can be envisaged, with either being the disease-initiating factor yet acting together during disease progression. Multiple potential mechanisms exist in which mitochondrial dysfunction and αSynuclein could interact to exacerbate their neurodegenerative properties.

EWS-FLI1 has been shown to be crucial for ES cell survival and tumor growth. However, its regulation is still enigmatic. To date, no functionally significant post-translational modifications of EWS-FLI1 have been shown. Since ES are sensitive to histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDI), and these inhibitors are advancing in clinical trials, we sought to identify if EWS-FLI1 is directly acetylated. We convincingly show acetylation of the C-terminal FLI1 (FLI1-CTD) domain, which is the DNA binding domain of EWS-FLI1. In vitro acetylation studies showed that acetylated FLI1-CTD has higher DNA binding activity than the non-acetylated protein. Over-expression of PCAF or treatment with HDI increased the transcriptional activity of EWS-FLI1, when co-expressed in Cos7 cells. However, our data that evaluates the acetylation of full-length EWS-FLI1 in ES cells remains unclear, despite creating acetylation specific antibodies to four potential acetylation sites. We conclude that EWS-FLI1 may either gain access to chromatin as a result of histone acetylation or undergo regulation by direct acetylation. These data should be considered when patients are treated with HDAC inhibitors. Further investigation of this phenomenon will reveal if this potential acetylation has an impact on tumor response.",EWS-FLI1;acetylation;Ewing’s sarcoma;PCAF

Here, functional elements of the dengue virus (DENV) capsid (C) protein were investigated. Study of the N-terminal region of DENV C has been limited by the presence of overlapping cis-acting RNA elements within the protein-coding region. To dissociate these two functions, we used a recombinant DENV RNA with a duplication of essential RNA structures outside the C coding sequence. By the use of this system, the highly conserved amino acids FNML, which are encoded in the RNA cyclization sequence 5′CS, were found to be dispensable for C function. In contrast, deletion of the N-terminal 18 amino acids of C impaired DENV particle formation. Two clusters of basic residues (R5-K6-K7-R9 and K17-R18-R20-R22) were identified as important. A systematic mutational analysis indicated that a high density of positive charges, rather than particular residues at specific positions, was necessary. Furthermore, a differential requirement of N-terminal sequences of C for viral particle assembly was observed in mosquito and human cells. While no viral particles were observed in human cells with a virus lacking the first 18 residues of C, DENV propagation was detected in mosquito cells, although to a level about 50-fold less than that observed for a wild-type (WT) virus. We conclude that basic residues at the N terminus of C are necessary for efficient particle formation in mosquito cells but that they are crucial for propagation in human cells. This is the first report demonstrating that the N terminus of C plays a role in DENV particle formation. In addition, our results suggest that this function of C is differentially modulated in different host cells.",

Different isoforms of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (PMCA) are responsible for Ca2+ extrusion at the apical and basolateral membrane of polarized epithelial cells, but the mechanisms and signals for differential targeting of the PMCAs are not well understood. Recent work demonstrated that the alternatively spliced w-insert in PMCA2 directs this pump to the apical membrane. We now show that inserting the w-insert into the corresponding location of the PMCA4 isoform confers apical targeting to this normally basolateral pump. Mutation of a dileucine motif in the C-tail thought to be important for basolateral targeting did not enhance apical localization of the chimeric PMCA4(2w)/b. In contrast, replacing the C-terminal Val residue by Leu to optimize the PDZ ligand site for interaction with the scaffolding protein NHERF2 enhanced the apical localization of PMCA4(2w)/b, but not of PMCA4×/b. Functional studies showed that both apical PMCA4(2w)/b and basolateral PMCA4×/b handled ATP-induced Ca2+ signals with similar kinetics, suggesting that isoform-specific functional characteristics are retained irrespective of membrane targeting.

The Atl protein contains 1,025 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 113 kDa and has a conserved N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase domain. Recombinant Atl was expressed in Escherichia coli, and its bacteriolytic and fibronectin-binding activities were confirmed by zymography and Western affinity blotting. Two bacteriolytic bands were shown in the sodium dodecyl sulfate extracts of HA9801, while both were absent from the atl inactivated mutant. Cell chains of the mutant strain became longer than that of the parental strain. In the autolysis assay, HA9801 decreased to 20% of the initial optical density (OD) value, while the mutant strain had almost no autolytic activity. The biofilm capacity of the atl mutant was reduced ∼30% compared to the parental strain. In the zebrafish infection model, the 50% lethal dose of the mutant strain was increased up to 5-fold. Furthermore, the adherence to HEp-2 cells of the atl mutant was 50% less than that of the parental strain. Based on the functional analysis of the recombinant Atl and observed effects of atl inactivation on HA9801, we conclude that Atl is a major autolysin of HA9801.

Genetic amplification, and mRNA and protein overexpression of Aurora-A are common in many types of solid tumor, and associated with aneuploidy, supernumerary centrosomes, defective mitotic spindles, and resistance to apoptosis. These properties have led Aurora-A to be considered a high value target for development of cancer therapeutics, with multiple agents currently in early phase clinical trials. More recently, identification of additional, non-mitotic functions and means of activation of Aurora-A during interphase neurite elongation and ciliary resorption have significantly expanded understanding of its function, and may offer insights into clinical performance of Aurora-A inhibitors. We here review mitotic and non-mitotic functions of Aurora-A, discuss Aurora-A regulation in the context of protein structural information, and evaluate progress in understanding and inhibiting Aurora-A in cancer.",Aurora-A;AURKA;cancer;mitosis;cell cycle;kinase;centrosome;cilia

V. cholerae produces RtxA, a large toxin of the MARTX family, which is targeted to the host cell cytosol, where its actin cross-linking domain (ACD) cross-links G-actin, leading to F-actin depolymerization, cytoskeleton rearrangements, and cell rounding. These effects on the cytoskeleton prevent phagocytosis and bacterial engulfment by macrophages, thus preventing V. cholerae clearance from the gut. The V. cholerae Type VI secretion-associated VgrG1 protein also contains a C-terminal ACD, which shares 61% identity with MARTX ACD and has been shown to covalently cross-link G-actin. Here, we purified the VgrG1 C-terminal domain and determined its crystal structure. The VgrG1 ACD exhibits a V-shaped three-dimensional structure, formed of 12 β-strands and nine α-helices. Its active site comprises five residues that are conserved in MARTX ACD toxin, within a conserved area of ∼10 Å radius. We showed that less than 100 ACD molecules are sufficient to depolymerize the actin filaments of a fibroblast cell in vivo. Mutagenesis studies confirmed that Glu-16 is critical for the F-actin depolymerization function.

Differentiation of the epidermis begins in mid embryogenesis and involves apical-basal polarization of the cytoskeletal and secretory systems as well as cellular junction formation. Secretion of the external cuticle layers is one of the major developmental and physiological specializations of the epidermal epithelium. The four post-embryonic larval stages are separated by periodic moults, in which the epidermis generates a new cuticle with stage-specific characteristics. The differentiated epidermis also plays key roles in endocrine signaling, fat storage, and ionic homeostasis. The epidermis is intimately associated with the development and function of the nervous system, and may have glial-like roles in modulating neuronal function. The epidermis provides passive and active defenses against skin-penetrating pathogens and can repair small wounds. Finally, age-dependent deterioration of the epidermis is a prominent feature of aging and may affect organismal aging and lifespan.",EPITHELIA;MORPHOGENESIS;PAR PROTEINS;barrier epithelia;wound healing

It is especially important for free-living organisms such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When exposed to hyperosmotic stress, the yeast initiates a complex adaptive program that includes temporary arrest of cell-cycle progression, adjustment of transcription and translation patterns, and the synthesis and retention of the compatible osmolyte glycerol. These adaptive responses are mostly governed by the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, which is composed of membrane-associated osmosensors, an intracellular signaling pathway whose core is the Hog1 MAP kinase (MAPK) cascade, and cytoplasmic and nuclear effector functions. The entire pathway is conserved in diverse fungal species, while the Hog1 MAPK cascade is conserved even in higher eukaryotes including humans. This conservation is illustrated by the fact that the mammalian stress-responsive p38 MAPK can rescue the osmosensitivity of hog1Δ mutations in response to hyperosmotic challenge. As the HOG pathway is one of the best-understood eukaryotic signal transduction pathways, it is useful not only as a model for analysis of osmostress responses, but also as a model for mathematical analysis of signal transduction pathways. In this review, we have summarized the current understanding of both the upstream signaling mechanism and the downstream adaptive responses to hyperosmotic stress in yeast.",

In connection with the global trend of prolonging human life and the increasing number of elderly in the population, the AD becomes one of the most serious health and socioeconomic problems of the present. Tau protein promotes assembly and stabilizes microtubules, which contributes to the proper function of neuron. Alterations in the amount or the structure of tau protein can affect its role as a stabilizer of microtubules as well as some of the processes in which it is implicated. The molecular mechanisms governing tau aggregation are mainly represented by several posttranslational modifications that alter its structure and conformational state. Hence, abnormal phosphorylation and truncation of tau protein have gained attention as key mechanisms that become tau protein in a pathological entity. Evidences about the clinicopathological significance of phosphorylated and truncated tau have been documented during the progression of AD as well as their capacity to exert cytotoxicity when expressed in cell and animal models. This paper describes the normal structure and function of tau protein and its major alterations during its pathological aggregation in AD.",

The mechanisms by which spherical viruses assemble from hundreds of capsid proteins around nucleic acid, however, are yet unresolved. Using Time-Resolved Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (TR-SAXS) we have been able to directly visualize SV40 VP1 pentamers encapsidating short RNA molecules (500 mers). This assembly process yields T = 1 icosahedral particles comprised of 12 pentamers and one RNA molecule. The reaction is nearly 1/3 complete within 35 milliseconds, following a two–state kinetic process with no detectable intermediates. Theoretical analysis of kinetics, using a master equation, shows that the assembly process nucleates at the RNA and continues by a cascade of elongation reactions in which one VP1 pentamer is added at a time, with a rate of approximately 109 M−1 s−1. The reaction is highly robust and faster than the predicted diffusion limit. The emerging molecular mechanism, which appears to be general to viruses that assemble around nucleic acids, implicates long-ranged electrostatic interactions. The model proposes that the growing nucleo-protein complex acts as an electrostatic antenna that attracts other capsid subunits for the encapsidation process.",Time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering;SV40;virus-like-particles;self-assembly;virus assembly kinetics;virus assembly mechanism

Autoprocessing at the N terminus of PR mediates stable dimer formation essential for catalytic activity leading to the formation of infectious virus. An antiparallel β-sheet interface formed by the four N- and C-terminal residues of each subunit is important for dimer stability. Here, we present the first high-resolution crystal structures of model protease precursor-clinical inhibitor (PI darunavir or saquinavir) complexes revealing varying conformations of the N-terminal flanking (S−4FNF−1) and interface residues (P1QIT4). A 180° rotation of the T4-L5 peptide bond is accompanied by a new Q2-L5 hydrogen bond and complete disengagement of PQIT from the β-sheet dimer interface, which may be a feature for intramolecular autoprocessing. This result is consistent with drastically lower thermal stability by 14–20 °C of PI complexes of precursors and the mature PR lacking its PQIT residues (by 18.3 °C). Similar to the TFR-PR precursor, this deletion also results in a darunavir dissociation constant 2x104-fold higher and a markedly increased dimer dissociation constant relative to the mature PR. The terminal β-sheet perturbations of the dimeric structure likely account for the drastically poorer inhibition of autoprocessing of TFR-PR relative to the mature PR, even though significant differences in active site-PI interactions in these structures were not observed. The novel conformations of the dimer interface may be exploited to target selectively the protease precursor prior to its N-terminal cleavage.",HIV-1 protease;Precursor processing;Crystal structure;Protease inhibitor;Calorimetry

Although myosin VI has a short lever arm containing only one “IQ-motif” and a unique insertion for CaM binding, the motor walks with large and variable step sizes of ∼30–36 nm. Here, we show that the previously predicted coiled-coil domain immediately following the IQ-motifs (referred to as the lever arm extension (LAE)) adopts a stable monomeric, three-helix bundle fold in solution. Importantly, the LAE can undergo reversible, lipid membrane-dependent conformational changes. Upon exposure to lipid membranes, the LAE adopts a partially extended rod shape, and the removal of lipids from the LAE converts it back into the compact helix bundle structure. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that lipid membrane binding may initiate unfolding and thereby trigger the LAE expansion.

A key target of E7 is the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility locus (pRb). This interaction results in the release of E2F transcription factors and drives the host cell into the S phase of the cell cycle. E7 binds pRb via a high-affinity binding site in conserved region 2 (CR2) and also targets a portion of cellular pRb for degradation via the proteasome. Evidence suggests that a secondary binding site exists in CR3, and that this interaction influences pRb deregulation. Additionally, evidence suggests that CR3 also participates in the degradation of pRb. We have systematically analyzed the molecular mechanisms by which CR3 contributes to deregulation of the pRb pathway by utilizing a comprehensive series of mutations in residues predicted to be exposed on the surface of HPV16 E7 CR3. Despite differences in the ability to interact with cullin 2, all CR3 mutants degrade pRb comparably to wild-type E7. We identified two specific patches of residues on the surface of CR3 that contribute to pRb binding independently of the high-affinity CR2 binding site. Mutants within CR3 that affect pRb binding are less effective than the wild-type E7 in overcoming pRb-induced cell cycle arrest. This demonstrates that the interaction between HPV16 E7 CR3 and pRb is functionally important for alteration of the cell cycle.",

We report here that glucose restriction (GR) induces p53 mutant deacetylation, routing it for degradation via autophagy. Depletion of p53 leads, in turn, to robust autophagic activation and to cell death, while expression of degradation-defective mutant p53 blocks autophagy and enables survival to GR. Furthermore, we found that a carbohydrate-free dietetic regimen that lowers the fasting glucose levels blunts p53 mutant expression and oncogenic activity relative to a normal diet in several animal model systems. These findings indicate that the stability of mutant forms of p53 is influenced by the levels of glucose and by dietetic habits. They also unravel the existence of an inhibitory loop between autophagy and mutant p53 that can be exploited therapeutically.",p53;mutant;mutations;autophagy;proteasome;glucose;acetylation;tumor;cancer;diet

The interaction between Orai1 and CaM at the atomic level remains unknown. Here, we report the crystal structure of a CaM·Orai1-CMBD complex showing one CMBD bound to the C-terminal lobe of CaM, differing from other CaM-target protein complexes, in which both N- and C-terminal lobes of CaM (CaM-N and CaM-C) are involved in target binding. Orai1-CMBD binds CaM-C mainly through hydrophobic interactions, primarily involving residue Trp76 of Orai1-CMBD, which interacts with the hydrophobic pocket of CaM-C. However, NMR data, isothermal titration calorimetry data, and pulldown assays indicated that CaM-N and CaM-C both can bind Orai1-CMBD, with CaM-N having ∼4 times weaker affinity than CaM-C. Pulldown assays of a Orai1-CMBD(W76E) mutant, gel filtration chromatography data, and NOE signals indicated that CaM-N and CaM-C can each bind one Orai1-CMBD. Thus our studies support an unusual, extended 1:2 binding mode of CaM to Orai1-CMBDs, and quantify the affinity of Orai1 for CaM. We propose a two-step mechanism for CaM-dependent Orai1 inactivation initiated by binding of the C-lobe of CaM to the CMBD of one Orai1 followed by the binding of the N-lobe of CaM to the CMBD of a neighboring Orai1.",Calcium Channels;Calcium Signaling;Calmodulin;Crystal Structure;Structural Biology;Orai1;Store-operated Calcium Entry;Calcium-dependent Inactivation;Calmodulin-binding Domain

Like other tumors, it is a disease with a complex, heterogeneous genetic and biochemical background. No single genomic or metabolic condition can be regarded as decisive for its formation and progression. However, a few key players can be pointed out and among them is the TP53 tumor suppressor gene, commonly mutated in breast cancer. In particular, TP53 mutations are exceptionally frequent and apparently among the key driving factors in triple negative breast cancer —the most aggressive breast cancer subgroup—whose management still represents a clinical challenge. The majority of TP53 mutations result in the substitution of single aminoacids in the central region of the p53 protein, generating a spectrum of variants (’mutant p53s’, for short). These mutants lose the normal p53 oncosuppressive functions to various extents but can also acquire oncogenic properties by gain-of-function mechanisms. This review discusses the molecular processes translating gene mutations to the pathologic consequences of mutant p53 tumorigenic activity, reconciling cell and animal models with clinical outcomes in breast cancer. Existing and speculative therapeutic methods targeting mutant p53 are also discussed, taking into account the overlap of mutant and wild-type p53 regulatory mechanisms and the crosstalk between mutant p53 and other oncogenic pathways in breast cancer. The studies described here concern breast cancer models and patients—unless it is indicated otherwise and justified by the importance of data obtained in other models.",

We have previously described a histopathological Unified Staging System for LBD that classifies the spread of α-synuclein phosphorylated at serine 129 (pS129-α-synuclein) from olfactory bulb to brainstem or limbic regions, and finally neocortex. Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites are highly enriched in pS129-α-synuclein. Increased formation of pS129-α-synuclein changes its solubility properties enhancing its tendency to aggregate and disrupt normal function. As in vitro and animal studies have shown that inhibiting formation of pS129-α-synuclein can prevent toxic consequences, this has become one of the therapeutic targets for LBD. However, detailed biochemical descriptions of the changes in pS129-α-synuclein properties in diseased human brains are needed to further our understanding of how these might contribute to molecular pathogenesis. In this study, we used 130 separate brain samples from cingulate cortex (limbic cortex) and 131 from temporal cortex (neocortex) that had been staged according to our Unified Staging System to examine progressive changes in properties of pS129-α-synuclein with the formation of progressively more severe histological Lewy-type pathology. The brain samples from these staged cases had been separated into cytosol-enriched, membrane-enriched (detergent soluble) and insoluble (ureas/SDS soluble) fractions. We also characterized the nature and appearance of higher molecular weight forms of pS129-α-synuclein. The major species was the 16 kD monomeric form; this accumulated with increasing stage with a large increase in Stage IV samples. By comparing two brain regions, we showed higher accumulation of insoluble pS129-α-synuclein in cingulate cortex, where histological deposits occur first, than in temporal cortex in samples with advanced (Stage IV) LB pathology.",Western blots;Parkinson’s disease;antibodies;fractionation;post-translational modification;postmortem brain tissue;dementia with Lewy bodies;incidental Lewy body disease;pathogenesis;aggregation

In a second reaction, AEs catalyze the transfer of the acyl group of the acyladenylate onto a nucleophilic amino, alcohol, or thiol group of an acceptor molecule leading to amide, ester, and thioester products, respectively. Mycobacterium tuberculosis encodes for more than 60 adenylating enzymes, many of which represent potential drug targets due to their confirmed essentiality or requirement for virulence. Several strategies have been used to develop potent and selective AE inhibitors including high-throughput screening, fragment-based screening, and the rationale design of bisubstrate inhibitors that mimic the acyladenylate. In this review, a comprehensive analysis of the mycobacterial adenylating enzymes will be presented with a focus on the identification of small molecule inhibitors. Specifically, this review will cover the aminoacyl tRNA-synthetases (aaRSs), MenE required for menaquinone synthesis, the FadD family of enzymes including the fatty acyl-AMP ligases (FAAL) and the fatty acyl-CoA ligases (FACLs) involved in lipid metabolism, and the nonribosomal peptide synthetase adenylation enzyme MbtA that is necessary for mycobactin synthesis.

The induction and sensing of membrane curvature is a complex topic 17 that with respect to the ECD has so far been addressed in a preliminary fashion, and will require further investigation. There are several other candidates for a membrane curvature-sensing element in the PIK3C3 interactome. For example, SH3GLB1 interacts with BECN1 via UVRAG; the former has a BAR domain that may be critical in membrane deformation for autophagy 18. In addition, there are components that detect membrane curvature such as the BARKOR autophagosome targeting sequence (BATS) domain of ATG14 19, which may be critical in the membrane recruitment of the PtdIns3K.

They invariably terminate in a di-Tyr sequence followed by a nonconserved amino acid, all of which remains linked to the active polypeptide (Dittmar et al., 2002). Rather then becoming covalently attached to other proteins, studies using yeast and mammalian cells show that HUB1 likely acts noncovalently, and accordingly no E1s, E2s, E3s, or processing enzymes have been identified for HUB1 in any eukaryote (Fig. 2). Genetic analyses of yeast HUB1 revealed roles in polarized growth, cell cycle progression, and the mitochondrial unfolded protein response, which might be collectively manifested by defective mRNA splicing (Dittmar et al., 2002; Mishra et al., 2011). In particular, HUB1 appears essential for cleaving noncanonical 5′ splice sites through interactions with the spliceosomal tri-small ribonucleoprotein particle, which in Arabidopsis likely involves binding to the Prp38 subunit (Mishra et al., 2011). Whereas Δhub1 mutants in yeast are viable, consistent with its strong avoidance of alternative splicing, S. pombe Δhub1 mutants are lethal (Wilkinson et al., 2004; Mishra et al., 2011). Arabidopsis contains two loci that encode HUB1 proteins with 95% amino acid sequence identity; one (At5g42300) shows strong expression, whereas the other (At3g45180) is expressed poorly, if at all, and may be a pseudogene (A. Lomax and R.D. Vierstra, unpublished data). Whether HUB1 is essential to Arabidopsis or other plants is not yet known.",

To facilitate measurement in individual living cells, we developed a rapid laser temperature stepping method capable of measuring complete thermal melts and kinetic traces in about two min. We find that this method yields improved thermal melts compared to heating a sample chamber or microscope stage. By comparing results for six cells with in vitro data, we show that the protein is stabilized by about 6 kJ/mole in the cytoplasm, but the temperature dependence of folding kinetics is similar to in vitro. The main difference is a slightly steeper temperature dependence of the folding rate in some cells that can be rationalized in terms of temperature-dependent crowding, local viscosity, or hydrophobicity. The observed rate coefficients can be fitted within measurement uncertainty by an effective two-state model, even though PGK folds by a multistate mechanism. We validate the effective two-state model with a three-state free energy landscape of PGK to illustrate that the effective fitting parameters can represent a more complex underlying free energy landscape.",activation barrier;fluorescence microscopy;Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET);green fluorescent protein (GFP);thermal denaturation

While facilitating translocation of nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) and NTR·cargo complexes, they suppress passive passage of macromolecules ⩾30 kDa. Previously, we reconstituted the NPC barrier as hydrogels comprising S. cerevisiae FG domains. We now studied FG domains from 10 Xenopus nucleoporins and found that all of them form hydrogels. Related domains with low FG motif density also substantially contribute to the NPC's hydrogel mass. We characterized all these hydrogels and observed the strictest sieving effect for the Nup98-derived hydrogel. It fully blocks entry of GFP-sized inert objects, permits facilitated entry of the small NTR NTF2, but arrests importin β-type NTRs at its surface. O-GlcNAc modification of the Nup98 FG domain prevented this arrest and allowed also large NTR·cargo complexes to enter. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy revealed that the O-GlcNAc-modified Nup98 gel lacks amyloid-like β-structures that dominate the rigid regions in the S. cerevisiae Nsp1 FG hydrogel.

Essential to their function is the formation of tetramers, allowing cooperative binding to their DNA response elements. We solved crystal structures of the human p63 tetramerization domain, showing that p63 forms a dimer of dimers with D2 symmetry composed of highly intertwined monomers. The primary dimers are formed via an intramolecular β-sheet and hydrophobic helix packing (H1), a hallmark of all p53 family members. Like p73, but unlike p53, p63 requires a second helix (H2) to stabilize the architecture of the tetramer. In order to investigate the impact of structural differences on tetramer stability, we measured the subunit exchange reaction of p53 family homotetramers by nanoflow electrospray mass spectrometry. There were differences in both the kinetics and the pattern of the exchange reaction, with the p53 and p63 tetramers exhibiting much faster exchange kinetics than p73. The structural similarity between p63 and p73 rationalizes previous observations that p63 and p73 form mixed tetramers, and the kinetic data reveal the dissociation of the p73 homotetramers as the rate-limiting step for heterotetramer formation.

Despite the importance of PUFA, their molecular mechanism of action remains unclear. One emerging hypothesis is that phospholipids containing n-3 PUFA acyl chains modify the structure and composition of membrane rafts, thus affecting cell signaling. In this study the two major n-3 PUFA found in fish oils, eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids, are compared. Using solid-state 2H NMR spectroscopy we explored the molecular organization of 1-[2H31]palmitoyl-2-eicosapentaenoylphosphatidylcholine (PEPC-d31) and 1-[2H31]palmitoyl-2-docosahexaenoylphosphatidylcholine (PDPC-d31) in mixtures with sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol (chol). Our results indicate that whereas both PEPC-d31 and PDPC-d31 can accumulate into SM-rich/chol-rich raftlike domains, the tendency for DHA to incorporate into rafts is more than twice as great as for EPA. We propose that DHA may be the more bioactive component of fish oil that serves to disrupt lipid raft domain organization.

Previous studies suggested that the hexameric Escherichia coli Hfq (HfqEc) binds sRNAs on the proximal site, whereas the distal site has been implicated in Hfq–mRNA interactions. Employing a combination of small angle X-ray scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance and biochemical approaches, we report the structural analysis of a 1:1 complex of HfqEc with a 34-nt-long subsequence of a natural substrate sRNA, DsrA (DsrA34). This sRNA is involved in post-transcriptional regulation of the E. coli rpoS mRNA encoding the stationary phase sigma factor RpoS. The molecular envelopes of HfqEc in complex with DsrA34 revealed an overall asymmetric shape of the complex in solution with the protein maintaining its doughnut-like structure, whereas the extended DsrA34 is flexible and displays an ensemble of different spatial arrangements. These results are discussed in terms of a model, wherein the structural flexibility of RNA ligands bound to Hfq stochastically facilitates base pairing and provides the foundation for the RNA chaperone function inherent to Hfq.",

Although genetic and cell biological aspects have been elucidated, the molecular details of HP1 binding to H3K9me3 nucleosomes are unknown. Using a combination of NMR spectroscopy and biophysical measurements on fully defined recombinant experimental systems, we demonstrate that H3K9me3 works as an on/off switch regulating distinct binding modes of hHP1β to the nucleosome. The methyl-mark determines a highly flexible and very dynamic interaction of the chromodomain of hHP1β with the H3-tail. There are no other constraints of interaction or additional multimerization interfaces. In contrast, in the absence of methylation, the hinge region and the N-terminal tail form weak nucleosome contacts mainly with DNA. In agreement with the high flexibility within the hHP1β-H3K9me3 nucleosome complex, the chromoshadow domain does not provide a direct binding interface.

SpoIIE is a membrane protein that localizes to the polar cell division sites where it causes FtsZ to relocate from mid-cell to form polar Z-rings. Following polar septation, SpoIIE establishes compartment-specific gene expression in the smaller forespore cell by dephosphorylating the anti-sigma factor antagonist SpoIIAA, leading to the release of the RNA polymerase sigma factor σF from an inhibitory complex with the anti-sigma factor SpoIIAB. SpoIIE therefore couples morphological development to differential gene expression. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the phosphatase domain of SpoIIE to 2.6 Å spacing, revealing a domain-swapped dimer. SEC-MALLS (size-exclusion chromatography with multi-angle laser light scattering) analysis however suggested a monomer as the principal form in solution. A model for the monomer was derived from the domain-swapped dimer in which 2 five-stranded β-sheets are packed against one another and flanked by α-helices in an αββα arrangement reminiscent of other PP2C-type phosphatases. A flap region that controls access of substrates to the active site in other PP2C phosphatases is diminished in SpoIIE, and this observation correlates with the presence of a single manganese ion in the active site of SpoIIE in contrast to the two or three metal ions present in other PP2C enzymes.

Flexible filamentous viruses have defied more than two decades of effort in fiber diffraction, and no high-resolution structure is available for any member of the Alphaflexiviridae family. Here we report our structural characterization of PapMV by X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM 3D reconstruction. We found that PapMV is 135 Å in diameter with a helical symmetry of ~ 10 subunits per turn. Crystal structure of the C-terminal truncated PMV coat protein reveals a novel all helix fold with seven α-helices. Thus the PMV CP structure is different from the four-helix bundle fold of Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) in which helix bundling dominates the subunit interface in TMV and conveys rigidity to the rod virus. PapMV coat protein was crystallized as an asymmetrical dimer in which one protein lassoes the other by the N-terminal peptide. Mutation of residues critical to the inter-subunit lasso interaction abolishes coat protein polymerization. The crystal structure suggests that PMV may polymerize via the consecutive N-terminal loop lassoing mechanism. The structure of PapMV will be useful for rational design and engineering of the PapMV nanoparticles into innovative vaccines.",Plant virus;Alphaflexiviridae;protein structure;cryo-EM;X-ray crystallography

It was our objective to investigate the ethanol-induced dissociation of micellar casein as affected by temperature and a wide range of pH, along with the concentrations of calcium and casein. Two different concentrations of casein micelles were dispersed in imidazole buffer with 0 to 80% ethanol (vol/vol) and 2 and 10 mM calcium. Apparent micelle size was determined by dynamic light scattering at 5, 30, and 60°C. In the absence of ethanol, casein precipitation occurred at pH 4.6 in imidazole buffer. Ten to forty percent ethanol promoted casein aggregation (>1,000 nm) and higher temperature (30 and 60°C) enhanced this effect. Higher ethanol concentrations at 50 to 80% induced the dissociation (<40 nm) of the casein micelle upon acidification (pH <5) and alkalization (pH >8) in imidazole buffer. In addition, higher concentrations of casein (0.25 mg/mL) and calcium (20 mM) caused the formation of larger aggregates (>1,000 nm) in the presence of ethanol when comparing with the initial lower concentrations of casein (0.1 mg/mL) and calcium (2 mM). Casein micelle dissociation can be achieved near the isoelectric pH by modifying the solvent composition and temperature.",casein micelle;ethanol;particle size;calcium

Previous studies have described the HVR as a proline-rich spacer between flanking functional domains of the ORF1 polyprotein. Others have proposed that the region has no function, that it reflects a hypermutable region of the virus genome, that it is derived from the insertion and evolution of host sequences or that it is subject to positive selection. This study attempts to differentiate between these explanations by documenting the evolutionary processes occurring within the HVR. We have measured the diversity of HVR sequences within acutely infected individuals or amongst sequences derived from epidemiologically linked samples and, surprisingly, find relative homogeneity amongst these datasets. We found no evidence of positive selection for amino acid substitution in the HVR. Through an analysis of published sequences, we conclude that the range of HVR diversity observed within virus genotypes can be explained by the accumulation of substitutions and, to a much lesser extent, through deletions or duplications of this region. All published HVR amino acid sequences display a relative overabundance of proline and serine residues that cannot be explained by a local bias towards cytosine in this part of the genome. Although all published HVRs contain one or more SH3-binding PxxP motifs, this motif does not occur more frequently than would be expected from the proportion of proline residues in these sequences. Taken together, these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the HVR has a structural role that is dependent upon length and amino acid composition, rather than a specific sequence.",

The flexible Formin Homology 1 (FH1) domain, located directly N-terminal to the FH2 domain, contains one or more stretches of polyproline that bind the actin-binding protein profilin. Diffusion of FH1 domains brings associated profilin-actin complexes into contact with the FH2-bound barbed end of the filament, thereby enabling direct transfer of actin. We investigated how the organization of the FH1 domain of budding yeast formin Bni1p determines the rates of profilin-actin transfer onto the end of the filament. Each FH1 domain transfers actin to the barbed end independently of the other and structural evidence suggests a preference for actin delivery from each FH1 domain to the closest long-pitch helix of the filament. The transfer reaction is diffusion-limited and influenced by the affinities of the FH1 polyproline tracks for profilin. Position-specific sequence variations optimize the efficiency of FH1-stimulated polymerization by binding profilin weakly near the FH2 domain and binding profilin more strongly farther away. FH1 domains of many other formins follow this organizational trend. This particular sequence architecture may optimize the efficiency of FH1-stimulated elongation.",Actin;ATP;Biophysics;Cytoskeleton;Microscopy;FH1 Domain;Formin;Polymerization

This interaction triggers a cascade of events involving other gene products unlinked to the S-locus that are crucial to the self-incompatibility response. To date, two essential pistil-modifier genes, 120K and High Top-Band (HT-B), have been identified in Nicotiana species. However, biochemistry and genetics indicate that additional modifier genes are required. We recently reported a Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitor, named NaStEP (for Nicotiana alata Stigma-Expressed Protein), that is highly expressed in the stigmas of self-incompatible Nicotiana species. Here, we report the proteinase inhibitor activity of NaStEP. NaStEP is taken up by both compatible and incompatible pollen tubes, but its suppression in Nicotiana spp. transgenic plants disrupts S-specific pollen rejection; therefore, NaStEP is a novel pistil-modifier gene. Furthermore, HT-B levels within the pollen tubes are reduced when NaStEP-suppressed pistils are pollinated with either compatible or incompatible pollen. In wild-type self-incompatible N. alata, in contrast, HT-B degradation occurs preferentially in compatible pollinations. Taken together, these data show that the presence of NaStEP is required for the stability of HT-B inside pollen tubes during the rejection response, but the underlying mechanism is currently unknown.",

One of the essential antiviral mechanisms is apoptosis induced by ligation of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1). This receptor can be activated by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), which upon binding to TNFR1 induces the assembly of first an inflammatory and later a proapoptotic signaling complex. Here, we report that infection by human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B) inhibited poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, caspase 3 and 8 activation, and IκBα Ser-32 phosphorylation downstream of TNFR1, indicating inhibition of both the inflammatory and apoptotic signaling pathways. We identified a hitherto uncharacterized viral protein, U20, as sufficient for mediating this inhibition. U20 was shown to locate to the cell membrane, and overexpression inhibited PARP cleavage, caspase 3 and 8 activation, IκBα Ser-32 phosphorylation, and NF-κB transcriptional activity. Moreover, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of U20 demonstrated that the protein is necessary for HHV-6B-mediated inhibition of TNFR signaling during infection. These results suggest an important novel function of U20 as a viral immune evasion protein during HHV-6B infection.",

The only documented mammalian enzyme capable of cleaving C-terminal to asparagine is asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP). TDP-43-immunoreactive fragments (~35 and 32 kDa) predicted to be generated by AEP cleavage at N291 and N306 were observed by western blot analyses of post-mortem FTLD brain tissue and cultured human cells over-expressing TDP-43. Studies in vitro determined that AEP can directly cleave TDP-43 at seven sites, including N291 and N306. Western blots of brain homogenates isolated from AEP-null mice and wild-type littermate controls revealed that TDP-43 proteolytic fragments were substantially reduced in the absence of AEP in vivo. Taken together, we conclude that TDP-43 is cleaved by AEP in brain. Moreover, these data highlight the utility of combining proteomic strategies in vitro and in vivo to provide insight into TDP-43 biology that will fuel the design of more detailed models of disease pathogenesis.",Asparaginyl endopeptidase;degradomics;frontotemporal dementia;neurodegeneration;TAR DNA-binding protein 43

EGFR overexpression or mutation in many different forms of cancers has highlighted its role as an important therapeutic target. Gefitinib, the first small molecule inhibitor of EGFR kinase function to be approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by the FDA, demonstrates clinical activity primarily in patients with tumors that harbor somatic kinase domain mutations in EGFR. Here, we compare wild-type EGFR autophosphorylation kinetics to the L834R (also called L858R) EGFR form, one of the most common mutations in lung cancer patients. Using rapid chemical quench, time resolved electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and western blot analyses, we examined the order of autophosphorylation in wild-type (WT) and L834R EGFR and the effect of gefitinib (Iressa ™) on the phosphorylation of individual tyrosines. These studies establish that there is a temporal order of autophosphorylation of key tyrosines involved in downstream signaling for WT EGFR and a loss of order for the oncogenic L834R mutant. These studies also reveal unique signature patterns of drug sensitivity for inhibition of tyrosine autophosphorylation by gefitinib; distinct for WT and oncogenic L834R mutant forms of EGFR. Fluorescence studies show that for WT EGFR, the binding affinity for gefitinib is weaker for the phosphorylated protein while for the oncogenic mutant, L834R EGFR, the binding affinity of gefitinib is substantially enhanced and likely contributes to the efficacy observed clinically. This mechanistic information is important in understanding the molecular details underpinning clinical observations as well as to aid in the design of more potent and selective EGFR inhibitors.",

The CERT PH domain specifically recognizes phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate (PtdIns(4)P), a characteristic phosphoinositide in the Golgi membrane, and is indispensable for the endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport of ceramide by CERT. In this study, we determined the three-dimensional structure of the CERT PH domain by using solution NMR techniques. The structure revealed the presence of a characteristic basic groove near the canonical PtdIns(4)P recognition site. An extensive interaction study using NMR and other biophysical techniques revealed that the basic groove coordinates the CERT PH domain for efficient PtdIns(4)P recognition and localization in the Golgi apparatus. The notion was also supported by Golgi mislocalization of the CERT mutants in living cells. The distinctive binding modes reflect the functions of PH domains, as the basic groove is conserved only in the PH domains involved with the PtdIns(4)P-dependent lipid transport activity but not in those with the signal transduction activity.",Golgi;Lipid Transport;NMR;Phosphoinositides;Protein Structure;CERT;PH Domain

Grigoryev, Email: ude.usp@71gas","Packing of about two meters of the human genome DNA into chromatin occupying a several micron-sized cell nucleus requires a high degree of compaction in a manner that allows the information encoded on DNA to remain easily accessible. This packing is mediated by repeated coiling of DNA double helix around histones to form nucleosome arrays that are further folded into higher-order structures. Relatively straight DNA linkers separate the nucleosomes and the spacing between consecutive nucleosome varies between different cells and between different chromosomal loci. In a recent work1 our group used a biochemically defined in vitro reconstituted system to explore how do various DNA linkers mediate nucleosome array packing into higher-order chromatin structures. For long nucleosome linkers (about 60 bp) we observed a more open chromatin structure and no effect of small linker length alterations (±2−4 bp) on chromatin folding. In striking contrast, for shorter linkers (20−32 bp) we found more compact packing with strong periodical dependence upon the linker DNA lengths. Our data together with high-resolution nucleosome position mapping provide evidence for the natural nucleosome repeats to support a chromatin architecture that, by default, restricts spontaneous folding of nucleosome arrays into compact chromatin fibers. We suggest that incomplete folding of the nucleosome arrays may promote global inter-array interactions that lead to chromatin condensation in metaphase chromosomes and heterochromatin.",chromatin;chromatin higher-order structure;nucleosome;sedimentation;electron microscopy

Recent studies have revealed that conversion occurs along the endocytic pathway. To better understand the dissociation process, we have investigated the effect of low pH on the stability of recombinant prion fibrils. We show that under conditions that mimic the endocytic environment, amyloid fibrils made from full length prion protein dissociate both laterally and axially to form protofilaments. About 5% of the protofilaments are short enough to be considered soluble and contain ~100–300 monomers per structure; these also retain the biophysical characteristics of the filaments. We propose that protonation of His residues and charge repulsion in the N-terminal domain trigger fibril dissociation. Our data suggest that lysosomes and late endosomes are competent milieus for propagating the misfolded state not only by destabilizing the normal prion protein, but by accelerating fibril dissociation into smaller structures that may act as seeds.",

We find that divalent ions produce a fiber stiffening effect that competes with, but does not overshadow, the dramatic softening triggered by dynamic-LH behavior. Indeed, we find that in typical in vivo conditions, dynamic-LH binding/unbinding reduces fiber stiffening dramatically (by a factor of almost 5, as measured by the elasticity modulus) compared with rigidly fixed LH, and also the force needed to initiate chromatin unfolding, making it consistent with those of molecular motors. Our data also show that, during unfolding, divalent ions together with LHs induce linker-DNA bending and DNA–DNA repulsion screening, which guarantee formation of heteromorphic superbeads-on-a-string structures that combine regions of loose and compact fiber independently of the characteristics of the LH–core bond. These structures might be important for gene regulation as they expose regions of the DNA selectively. Dynamic control of LH binding/unbinding, either globally or locally, in the presence of divalent ions, might constitute a mechanism for regulation of gene expression.",

Thus we aimed to demonstrate that a different organization of collagen fibers within newly formed bone under unloading conditions can be generated by differently architectured scaffolds. An ordered and confined geometry of hydroxyapatite foams concentrated collagen fibers within the pores, and triggered their self-assembly in a cholesteric-banded pattern, resulting in compact lamellar bone. Conversely, when progenitor cells were loaded onto nanofibrous collagen-based sponges, new collagen fibers were distributed in a nematic phase, resulting mostly in woven isotropic bone.

Bacterial asparaginases are used in cancer chemotherapy to deplete asparagine from the blood, since several hematological malignancies depend on extracellular asparagine for growth. To avoid the immune response against the bacterial enzymes it would be beneficial to replace them with human asparaginases. However, unlike the bacterial asparaginases, the human enzymes have a millimolar Km value for asparagine, making them inefficient in depleting the amino acid from blood. To facilitate the development of human variants suitable for therapeutic use, we solved the structure of human L-asparaginase (hASNase3). This asparaginase is an N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) family member that requires autocleavage between Gly167 and Thr168 to become catalytically competent. For most Ntn-hydrolases this autoproteolytic activation occurs efficiently. In contrast, hASNas3 is relatively stable in its uncleaved state, and this allowed us to observe the structure of the enzyme prior to cleavage. To determine the structure of the cleaved state we exploited our discovery that the free amino acid glycine promotes complete cleavage of hASNase3. Both enzyme states were elucidated in the absence and presence of the product aspartate. Together, these structures provide insight into the conformational changes required for cleavage, and on the precise enzyme-substrate interactions. The new understanding of hASNase3 will serve to guide the design of variants that possess a decreased Km value for asparagine, making the human enzyme a suitable replacement for the bacterial asparaginases in cancer therapy.",

These data support a sequential model for substrate loading and product release regulated by the thumb loop of Cbf5. The uridine substrate is first bound primarily through interaction with the guide RNA and then loaded into the active site while progressively interacted with the thumb. After modification, the subtle chemical structure change from uridine to pseudouridine at the target site triggers the release of the thumb, resulting in an intermediate complex with the product bound mainly by the guide RNA.

The melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R) is a target for obesity therapies because its activation triggers appetite suppression and increases energy expenditure. Cyclotides have been suggested as scaffolds for the insertion and stabilization of pharmaceutically active peptides. In this study, we explored the development of appetite-reducing peptides by synthesizing MC4R agonists based on the insertion of the His-Phe-Arg-Trp sequence into the cyclotide kalata B1. The ability of the analogues to fold similarly to kalata B1 but display MC4R activity were investigated. Four peptides were synthesized using t-butoxycarbonyl peptide chemistry with a C-terminal thioester to facilitate backbone cyclization. The structures of the peptides were found to be similar to kalata B1, evaluated by Hα NMR chemical shifts. KB1(GHFRWG;23–28) had a Ki of 29 nm at the MC4R and was 107 or 314 times more selective over this receptor than MC1R or MC5R, respectively, and had no detectable binding to MC3R. The peptide had higher affinity for the MC4R than the endogenous agonist, α-melanocyte stimulation hormone, but it was less potent at the MC4R, with an EC50 of 580 nm for activation of the MC4R. In conclusion, we synthesized melanocortin analogues of kalata B1 that preserve the structural scaffold and display receptor binding and functional activity.

The results revealed that induced disassembly of single minute-virus-of-mice particles is frequently initiated by loss of one of the 20 equivalent capsomers (trimers of capsid protein subunits) leading to a stable, nearly complete particle that does not readily lose further capsomers. With lower frequency, a fairly stable, three-fourths-complete capsid lacking one pentamer of capsomers and a free, stable pentamer were obtained. The intermediates most frequently identified (capsids missing one capsomer, capsids missing one pentamer of capsomers, and free pentamers of capsomers) had been predicted in theoretical studies of reversible capsid assembly based on thermodynamic-kinetic models, molecular dynamics, or oligomerization energies.

The addition of the bisecting GlcNAc confers unique lectin recognition properties to N-glycans. Thus, LEC10 gain-of-function Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells selected for the acquisition of ricin resistance, carry N-glycans with a bisecting GlcNAc, which enhances the binding of the erythroagglutinin E-PHA, but reduces the binding of ricin and galectins-1, -3 and -8. The altered interaction with galactose-binding lectins suggests that the bisecting GlcNAc affects N-glycan conformation. LEC10 mutants expressing polyoma middle T antigen (PyMT) exhibit reduced growth factor signaling. Furthermore, PyMT-induced mammary tumors lacking MGAT3, progress more rapidly than tumors with the bisecting GlcNAc on N-glycans of cell surface glycoproteins. In recent years, evidence for a new paradigm of cell growth control has emerged involving regulation of cell surface residency of growth factor and cytokine receptors via interactions and cross-linking of their branched N-glycans with a lattice of galectin(s). Specific cross-linking of glycoprotein receptors in the lattice regulates their endocytosis, leading to effects on growth factor-induced signaling. This review will describe evidence that the bisecting GlcNAc of N-glycans regulates cellular signaling and tumor progression, apparently through modulating N-glycan/galectin interactions.",Glycosylation;Bisecting GlcNAc;Complex N-glycans;Galectins;Mgat3

A positively charged linker that connects the histone-fold with the macro-domain was suggested to have DNA-binding properties, and has been shown to promote oligomerization of chromatin fibers. Here we examine the influence of this basic linker on DNA of mononucleosomes. We find that the macro-linker reduces accessibility to extranucleosomal DNA, and appears to increase compaction of the nucleosome. These properties arise from interactions between the H1-like basic linker region and DNA around the entry/exit site, which increases protection of nucleosomal DNA from exonuclease III digestion by ∼10 bp. By stabilizing the wrapping of DNA around the histone core, this basic linker of macroH2A may alter the distribution of nucleosome-associated factors, and potentially contribute to the more compacted nature of heterochromatin.",

The RNA structural transitions that have been characterized to date involve long-lived species that can be captured by structure characterization techniques. Here, we report the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance visualization of RNA transitions towards invisible ‘excited states’ (ES), which exist in too little abundance (2–13%) and for too short periods of time (45–250 μs) to allow structural characterization by conventional techniques. Transitions towards ESs result in localized rearrangements in base-pairing that alter building block elements of RNA architecture, including helix-junction-helix motifs and apical loops. The ES can inhibit function by sequestering residues involved in recognition and signaling or promote ATP-independent strand exchange. Thus, RNAs do not adopt a single conformation, but rather exist in rapid equilibrium with alternative ESs, which can be stabilized by cellular cues to affect functional outcomes.",

NIPP1, a nuclear regulator of serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), has been implicated in the regulation of EZH2 occupancy at target loci, but the underlying mechanism is not understood. Here, we demonstrate that the phosphorylation of EZH2 by cyclin-dependent kinases at Thr416 creates a docking site for the ForkHead-associated domain of NIPP1. Recruited NIPP1 enables the net phosphorylation of EZH2 by inhibiting its dephosphorylation by PP1. Accordingly, a NIPP1-binding mutant of EZH2 is hypophosphorylated, and the knockdown of NIPP1 results in a reduced phosphorylation of endogenous EZH2. Conversely, the loss of PP1 is associated with a hyperphosphorylation of EZH2. A genome-wide promoter-binding profiling in HeLa cells revealed that the NIPP1-binding mutant shows a deficient association with about a third of the Polycomb target genes, and these are enriched for functions in proliferation. Our data identify PP1 as an EZH2 phosphatase and demonstrate that the phosphorylation-regulated association of EZH2 with proliferation-related targets depends on associated NIPP1.",

Whether small molecules passively diffuse through a single central channel or through multiple holes of a hydrogel network is a subject of debate. Additionally, whether the passive and facilitated transport systems occupy distinct or overlapping physical regions of the NPC remains unclear. Here, we directly test these models using three-dimensional super-resolution fluorescence microscopy of human cells. This approach reveals that a single viscous central channel in the NPC acts as the sole pathway for passive diffusion of various small molecules; transport receptors and their cargo complexes take distinct transport routes in the periphery, which is occluded by phenylalanine-glycine filaments. Furthermore, the passive and facilitated passageways in the NPC are closely correlated, and their conformations can be simultaneously regulated by Importin β1 (a major transport receptor) and RanGTP (a critical regulator of transport directionality). These results strongly favor a self-regulated viscous channel configuration in native NPCs over the porous hydrogel meshwork model.",3D imaging;nucleoporins;single-molecule fluorescence;super-resolution microscopy

Here, we provide evidence that loss of mesenchymal Notch/CSL signaling causes tissue alterations, including stromal atrophy and inflammation, which precede and are potent triggers for epithelial tumors. Mice carrying a mesenchymal-specific deletion of CSL/RBP-Jκ, a key Notch effector, exhibit spontaneous multifocal keratinocyte tumors that develop after dermal atrophy and inflammation. CSL-deficient dermal fibroblasts promote increased tumor cell proliferation through up-regulation of c-Jun and c-Fos expression and consequently higher levels of diffusible growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, and matrix remodeling enzymes. In human skin samples, stromal fields adjacent to cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and multifocal premalignant actinic keratosis lesions exhibit decreased Notch/CSL signaling and associated molecular changes.

To investigate this process, regulatory site Ca2+ binding in the NH2-lobe of subunit troponin C (TnC) was abolished by mutagenesis, and effects on cardiac troponin dynamics were mapped by hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX)-MS. The findings demonstrate the interrelationships among troponin's detailed dynamics, troponin's regulatory actions, and the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy linked to troponin mutations. Ca2+ slowed HDX up to 2 orders of magnitude within the NH2-lobe and the NH2-lobe-associated TnI switch helix, implying that Ca2+ greatly stabilizes this troponin regulatory region. HDX of the TnI COOH terminus indicated that its known role in regulation involves a partially folded rather than unfolded structure in the absence of Ca2+ and actin. Ca2+-triggered stabilization extended beyond the known direct regulatory regions: to the start of the nearby TnI helix 1 and to the COOH terminus of the TnT-TnI coiled-coil. Ca2+ destabilized rather than stabilized specific TnI segments within the coiled-coil and destabilized a region not previously implicated in Ca2+-mediated regulation: the coiled-coil's NH2-terminal base plus the preceding TnI loop with which the base interacts. Cardiomyopathy-linked mutations clustered almost entirely within influentially dynamic regions of troponin, and many sites were Ca2+-sensitive. Overall, the findings demonstrate highly selective effects of regulatory site Ca2+, including opposite changes in protein dynamics at opposite ends of the troponin core domain. Ca2+ release triggers an intramolecular switching mechanism that propagates extensively within the extended troponin structure, suggests specific movements of the TnI inhibitory regions, and prominently involves troponin's dynamic features.",Calcium-binding Proteins;Cardiomyopathy;Molecular Motors;Muscle;Protein Dynamics;Protein Folding;Troponin

We document the reasons that make fibrils toxic. We show that α-syn and HttEx1 fibrils bind and permeabilize lipid vesicles. We also show that fibrils binding to the plasma membrane in cultured cells alter Ca2+ homeostasis.

neomycin prevents the remodeling of intersubunit bridges that normally accompanies the process of
subunit rotation to stabilize a partially rotated ribosome configuration in which peptidyl (P)-site

neomycin-stabilized intermediate is incompatible with the translation factor binding that is
required for distinct protein synthesis reactions. These findings reveal the functional importance

Studies of in vitro aggregation of α-synuclein are rendered complex because of the formation of a heterogeneous population of oligomers. With the use of confocal single-molecule fluorescence techniques, we demonstrate that small aggregates (oligomers) of α-synuclein formed from unbound monomeric species in the presence of organic solvent (DMSO) and iron (Fe3+) ions have a high affinity to bind to model membranes, regardless of the lipid-composition or membrane curvature. This binding mode contrasts with the well-established membrane binding of α-synuclein monomers, which is accompanied with α-helix formation and requires membranes with high curvature, defects in the lipid packing, and/or negatively charged lipids. Additionally, we demonstrate that membrane-bound α-synuclein monomers are protected from aggregation. Finally, we identified compounds that potently dissolved vesicle-bound α-synuclein oligomers into monomers, leaving the lipid vesicles intact.

In the last decade, several genes responsible for skin barrier defects observed in both monogenetic and complex, polygenic disorders have been elucidated and functionally characterized. This has led to an explosion of work in the last six years that has identified pathways connecting epidermal barrier disruption and antigen uptake as well as the quality and/or magnitude of the antigen-specific adaptive immune response. This review will introduce the notion that diseases arise from the dynamic crosstalk that occurs between the skin barrier and immune system using atopic dermatitis or eczema as the disease prototype. Nevertheless, the concepts put forth are highly relevant to a number of antigen-driven disorders for which skin barrier is at least transiently compromised such as psoriasis, allergic contact dermatitis and blistering disorders.",Atopic dermatitis;barrier;epicutaneous sensitization;allergen

Yet, the functional role of mGluR in rhythmic respiratory activity and many motor patterns is very poorly understood. Here, we used mouse respiratory brain-slice preparations containing the pre-Bötzinger Complex (pre-BötC) to identify the role of group I mGluR (mGluR1 and mGluR5) in respiratory rhythm generation. We found that activation of mGluR1/5 is not required for the pre-BötC to generate a respiratory rhythm. However, our data suggest that mGluR1 and mGluR5 differentially modulate the respiratory rhythm. Blocking endogenous mGluR5 activity with MPEP decreases the inspiratory burst duration, burst area and frequency, while it increases the irregularity of the fictive eupneic inspiratory rhythm generated by the pre-BötC. In contrast, blocking mGluR1 reduces the frequency. Moreover, the mGLUR1/5 agonist DHPG increases the frequency and decreases the irregularity of the respiratory rhythm. Based on prior studies, we hypothesized that mGluR-signaling decreases the irregularity of the respiratory rhythm by activating transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels, that carry a non-specific cation current (ICAN). Indeed, DHPG application reduces cycle-by-cycle variability and subsequent application of the TRPC channel blocker SKF-96365 reverses this effect. Our data suggest that mGluR5 activation of ICAN-carrying TRPC channels plays an important role in governing the cycle-by-cycle variability of the respiratory rhythm. These data suggest that modulation of TRPC channels may correct irregular respiratory rhythms in some central neuronal diseases.",breathing;transient receptor potential;central pattern generator;irregularity;rhythm generation

In these diseases, aberrant metal binding or improper regulation of redox active metal ions can induce oxidative stress by producing cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). Altered metal homeostasis is also frequently seen in the diseased state. As a result, the imaging of metals in intact biological cells and tissues has been very important for understanding the role of metals in neurodegenerative diseases. A wide range of imaging techniques have been utilized, including X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM), particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), all of which allow for the imaging of metals in biological specimens with high spatial resolution and detection sensitivity. These techniques represent unique tools for advancing the understanding of the disease mechanisms and for identifying possible targets for developing treatments.

Yet nonlinear optical methods, which include both second-order sum-frequency generation (SFG) and third-order coherent Raman scattering (CRS) techniques, offer several improved imaging capabilities over their linear precursors. Nonlinear vibrational microscopy features unprecedented vibrational imaging speeds, provides strategies for higher spatial resolution, and gives access to additional molecular parameters.

High frequency 236.6 GHz EPR, not previously applied to spin labeled oligonucleotides, was notably sensitive to fast, anisotropic, hindered local rotational motion of the spin probe, occurring approximately about the NO nitroxide axis. Labels attached to the 2′-amino cytidine sugar in the mini c TAR DNA showed such anisotropic motion, which was faster in the lower stem, a region previously suggested to be partially melted. More flexible labels attached to phosphorothioates at the end of the lower stem tumbled isotropically in mini c TAR DNA, mini TAR RNA, and ψ3 RNA, but at 5 °C the motion became more anisotropic for the labeled RNAs, implying more order within the RNA lower stems. As observed by 9.5 GHz EPR, the slowing of nanosecond motions of large segments of the oligonucleotide was enhanced by increasing the ratio of the nucleocapsid protein NCp7 to mini c TAR DNA from zero to two. The slowing was most significant at labels in the loop and near the bulge. At a 4:1 ratio of NCp7 to mini c TAR DNA all labels reported tumbling times > 5 ns, indicating a condensation of NCp7 and TAR DNA. At the 4:1 ratio, pulse dipolar EPR spectroscopy of bi-labels attached near the 3′ and 5′ terminals showed evidence for an NCp7-induced increase in the 3′ - 5 ′end-to-end distance distribution and a partially melted stem.",EPR;spin label;NCp7;mini c TAR DNA

Additionally, non genomic effects of NR ligands appear mediated by ill-defined mechanisms at the plasma membrane. These effects mediate potential therapeutic effects as small lipophilic molecule targets, and many efforts have been put in elucidating their precise mechanism of action and pathophysiological roles.

We have previously observed that at low NO concentrations the reaction with tetrameric hemoglobin occurs with an observed rate constant that is at least 5 times faster than that observed at higher concentrations. This was ascribed to a faster reaction of NO with a methemoglobin-nitrite complex. We now report detailed studies of this reaction of low NO with methemoglobin. Nitric oxide paradoxically reacts with ferric hemoglobin with faster observed rate constants at the lower NO concentration in a manner that is not affected by changes in nitrite concentration, suggesting that it is not a competition between NO and nitrite, as we previously hypothesized. By evaluation of the fast reaction in the presence of allosteric effectors and isolated β- and α-chains of hemoglobin, it appears that NO reacts with a subpopulation of β-subunit ferric hemes whose population is influenced by quaternary state, redox potential, and hemoglobin dimerization. To further characterize the role of nitrite, we developed a system that oxidizes nitrite to nitrate to eliminate nitrite contamination. Removal of nitrite does not alter reaction kinetics, but modulates reaction products, with a decrease in the formation of S-nitrosothiols. These results are consistent with the formation of NO2/N2O3 in the presence of nitrite. The observed fast reductive nitrosylation observed at low NO concentrations may function to preserve NO bioactivity via primary oxidation of NO to form nitrite or in the presence of nitrite to form N2O3 and S-nitrosothiols.",Allosteric Regulation;Enzyme Kinetics;Hemoglobin;Nitric Oxide;Nitrosylation;Nitrite;Nitrosothiols;Reductive Nitrosylation

Each FPMO efficiently couples reduction of a flavin cofactor by NAD(P)H to oxygenation of the target substrate via a (hydro)peroxyflavin intermediate. This purpose of this review is to describe in detail the Class A flavoprotein hydroxylases (FPMO) in the context of the other FPMO classes (B–F). Both one and two component FPMOs are found in nature. Two-component enzymes require, in addition to the monooxygenase, the involvement of a reductase that first catalyzes the reduction of the flavin by NAD(P)H. The Class A and B FPMOs are single-component and manage to orchestrate the same net reaction within a single peptide. The Class A enzymes have, by some considerable margin, the most complete research record. These enzymes use choreographed movements of the flavin ring that facilitate access of the organic substrates to the active site, provide a means for interaction of NADPH with the flavin, offer a mechanism to sequester the dioxygen reduction chemistry from solvent and a means to release the product. The majority of the discrete catalytic events of the catalytic cycle can be observed directly in exquisite detail using spectrophotometric kinetic methods and many of the key mechanistic conclusions are further supported by structural data. This review attempts to compile each of the key observations made for both paradigm and newly discovered examples of Class A FPMOs into a complete catalytic description of one enzymatic turnover.",monooxygenase;flavin;flavoprotein;molecular oxygen;oxygenase;monooxygenase

Affected women have marked insulin resistance, independent of obesity. This article summarizes the state of the science since we last reviewed the field in the Endocrine Reviews in 1997. There is general agreement that obese women with PCOS are insulin resistant, but some groups of lean affected women may have normal insulin sensitivity. There is a post-binding defect in receptor signaling likely due to increased receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 serine phosphorylation that selectively affects metabolic but not mitogenic pathways in classic insulin target tissues and in the ovary. Constitutive activation of serine kinases in the MAPK-ERK pathway may contribute to resistance to insulin's metabolic actions in skeletal muscle. Insulin functions as a co-gonadotropin through its cognate receptor to modulate ovarian steroidogenesis. Genetic disruption of insulin signaling in the brain has indicated that this pathway is important for ovulation and body weight regulation. These insights have been directly translated into a novel therapy for PCOS with insulin-sensitizing drugs. Furthermore, androgens contribute to insulin resistance in PCOS. PCOS may also have developmental origins due to androgen exposure at critical periods or to intrauterine growth restriction. PCOS is a complex genetic disease, and first-degree relatives have reproductive and metabolic phenotypes. Several PCOS genetic susceptibility loci have been mapped and replicated. Some of the same susceptibility genes contribute to disease risk in Chinese and European PCOS populations, suggesting that PCOS is an ancient trait.",

We have previously identified SPLUNC1 as an autocrine inhibitor of ENaC. We have now located the ENaC inhibitory domain of SPLUNC1 to SPLUNC1's N terminus, and a peptide corresponding to this domain, G22-A39, inhibited ENaC activity to a similar degree as full-length SPLUNC1 (∼2.5 fold). However, G22-A39 had no effect on the structurally related acid-sensing ion channels, indicating specificity for ENaC. G22-A39 preferentially bound to the β-ENaC subunit in a glycosylation-dependent manner. ENaC hyperactivity is contributory to cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Addition of G22-A39 to CF human bronchial epithelial cultures (HBECs) resulted in an increase in airway surface liquid height from 4.2 ± 0.6 to 7.9 ± 0.6 μm, comparable to heights seen in normal HBECs, even in the presence of neutrophil elastase. Our data also indicate that the ENaC inhibitory domain of SPLUNC1 may be cleaved away from the main molecule by neutrophil elastase, which suggests that it may still be active during inflammation or neutrophilia.

Whereas TATA-containing promoters in human cells usually contain a single transcription start site (TSS) located ∼30 bp downstream of the TATA element, transcription in the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae typically initiates at multiple sites within a window ranging from 30 to 70 bp or 40 to 200 bp downstream of a TATA element, respectively. By exchanging highly purified factors between reconstituted S. pombe and S. cerevisiae transcription systems, we confirmed previous observations that the dual exchange of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) confer the distinct initiation patterns between these yeast species. Surprisingly, however, further genetic and biochemical assays of TFIIB chimeras revealed that TFIIB and the proposed B-finger/reader domain do not play a role in determining the distinct initiation patterns between S. pombe and S. cerevisiae, but rather, these patterns are solely due to differences in RNAPII. These results are discussed within the context of a proposed model for the mechanistic coupling of the efficiency of early phosphodiester bond formation during productive TSS utilization and intrinsic elongation proficiency.",

The level of extracellular ATP is closely regulated by ATP hydrolyzing enzymes, such as ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (ENTPDases). ENTPDase1/CD39, which is expressed in immune cells, was shown to regulate immune responses by downregulating the ATP level. In this study, we analyzed the immunomodulatory function of ENTPDase7, which is preferentially expressed in epithelial cells in the small intestine. The targeted deletion of Entpd7 encoding ENTPDase7 in mice resulted in increased ATP levels in the small intestinal lumen. The number of Th17 cells was selectively increased in the small intestinal lamina propria in Entpd7−/− mice. Th17 cells were decreased by oral administration of antibiotics or the ATP antagonist in Entpd7−/− mice, indicating that commensal microbiota-dependent ATP release mediates the enhanced Th17 cell development in the small intestinal lamina propria of Entpd7−/− mice. In accordance with the increased number of small intestinal Th17 cells, Entpd7−/− mice were resistant to oral infection with Citrobacter rodentium. Entpd7−/− mice suffered from severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, which was associated with increased numbers of CD4+ T cells producing both IL-17 and IFN-γ. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that ENTPDase7 controls the luminal ATP level and, thereby, regulates Th17 cell development in the small intestine.",

Even though the CT domain is thought to be the main regulatory domain of most connexins, the physiological role of CT dimerization is currently unknown.

Maintaining the correct levels of dNTPs for DNA synthesis is important for minimising the mutation rate [3-7], and this is achieved by tight regulation of ribonucleotide reductase [2, 8, 9]. In fission yeast, ribonucleotide reductase is regulated in part by a small protein inhibitor, Spd1, which is degraded in S phase and after DNA damage to allow up-regulation of dNTP supply [10-12]. Spd1 degradation is mediated by the activity of the CRL4Cdt2 ubiquitin ligase complex [5, 13, 14]. This has been reported to be dependent on modulation of Cdt2 levels which are cell cycle regulated, peaking in S phase, and which also increase after DNA damage in a checkpoint-dependent manner [7, 13]. We show here that Cdt2 levels fluctuations are not sufficient to regulate Spd1 proteolysis and that the key step in this event is the interaction of Spd1 with the polymerase processivity factor PCNA, complexed onto DNA.

the OPLS-AA/L simulations did not yield native hairpin structures
at any temperatures tested. Simulations that used charge-groups or
peptide capping groups were not largely different from their uncapped
counterparts with single atom charge-groups. On the other hand, phosphorylation
of the threonine residue located at the β-turn significantly
affected the hairpin formation. To our knowledge, this is the first

folding. Such a comprehensive comparison will offer useful guidance

This concept, now 20 years old, has been solidified by fields of protein science, transgenic technology, and drug discovery in human cancer. However, it has been noted that a simple negative feedback loop between p53 and MDM2 lacks an intrinsic “activating” step that counteracts this inhibition and permits oscillation of the feedback to occur as p53 is switched on and off. More recent work has identified a solution to the missing piece of the picture that counters the negative feedback loop, which is MDM2 itself. Under conditions of genotoxic stress, MDM2 helps to activate p53 by increasing its rate of protein synthesis. This simple observation makes certain aspects of the p53 response more comprehensible such as why MDM2 is upregulated by p53 early on following DNA damage and how phosphorylation of MDM2 at the C-terminal Ser395 by ATM translates into p53 activation. The latter acts by inducing allosteric changes in the RING domain of MDM2 that expose its RNA binding pocket, support p53 synthesis, and suppress its degradation. This allosteric nature of MDM2 in the C-terminus mirrors the allosteric effects of the binding of small molecules to the p53 interacting pocket at the N-terminus of MDM2, which opens the core domain of MDM2 to central domains of p53, which controls p53 ubiquitination. Thus, the highly allosteric nature of MDM2 provides the basis for dynamic protein-protein interactions and protein-RNA interactions through which MDM2’s activity is regulated in p53 protein destruction or in p53 protein synthesis. We discuss these mechanisms and how this information can be exploited for drug development programs aimed at activating p53 via targeting MDM2.",Mdm2;p53;allosteric regulation

This method is based on the notion that protein conformations having different donor-acceptor distances and interconverting slowly compared to the fluorescent lifetime of the donor (PheCN) would exhibit different donor fluorescence lifetimes. Our results provide strong evidence suggesting that the native free energy basin of HP35 is populated with conformations that differ mostly in the position and mean helicity of the C-terminal helix. This finding is consistent with several previous experimental and computational studies and also the functional role of this helix.

When the landscape consists of thermodynamically stable states (low-energy basins), which are connected by narrow conformational pathways (i.e., bottlenecks), the narrowness slows the inter-basin round trips in conformational sampling. This results in inaccuracy of free energies for the basins. This difficulty is not cleared out even when an enhanced conformational sampling is fairly performed along a reaction coordinate. In this study, to enhance the inter-basin round trips we introduced a virtual state that covers the narrow pathways. The probability distribution function for the virtual state was controlled based on detailed balance condition for the inter-state transitions (transitions between the real-state basins and the virtual state). To mimic the free-energy landscape of a real biological system, we introduced a simple model where a wall separates two basins and a narrow hole is pierced in the wall to connect the basins. The sampling was done based on Monte Carlo (MC). We examined several hole-sizes and inter-state transition probabilities. For a small hole-size, a small inter-state transition probability produced a sampling efficiency 100 times higher than a conventional MC does. This result goes against ones intuition, because one considers generally that the sampling efficiency increases with increasing the transition probability. The present method is readily applicable to enhanced conformational sampling such as multi-canonical or adaptive umbrella sampling, and extendable to molecular dynamics.",bottleneck;pathway;enhanced sampling;multicanonical;adaptive umbrella

Our SFG results indicated that Pep-1 molecules adopted a β-sheet conformation when adsorbed to the surface of gel-phase DPPG lipid bilayers. When interacting with fluid-phase POPG lipid bilayers, Pep-1 adopted a mix of α-helical and β-sheet structures over a broad range of peptide concentrations. The orientation distribution of the α-helical Pep-1 segment associated with the fluid-phase bilayers was found to depend on the peptide concentration. SFG orientation analysis showed that Pep-1 molecules adopted an orientation nearly perpendicular to the plane of the bilayer for peptide concentrations of 0.28 μM and 1.4 μM. When the Pep-1 concentration was increased to 7.0 μM, combined SFG and ATR-FTIR measurements showed that Pep-1 molecules were associated with the bilayer with a broad orientation distribution. Our results demonstrated that lipid bilayer phase and peptide concentration affect the conformation and orientation of Pep-1 molecules associated with model cell membranes, which is crucial to the translocation process of CPPs. A combination of SFG and ATR-FTIR studies can be used to determine the conformation and orientation of CPPs interacting with model cell membranes in situ.",

However, the process of obtaining therapeutic antibodies remains time consuming and empirical. This review summarizes recent progresses in the field of computer-aided antibody development mainly focusing on antibody modeling, which is divided essentially into two parts: (i) modeling the antigen-binding site, also called the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), and (ii) predicting the relative orientations of the variable heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains. Among the six CDR loops, the greatest challenge is predicting the conformation of CDR-H3, which is the most important in antigen recognition. Further computational methods could be used in drug development based on crystal structures or homology models, including antibody–antigen dockings and energy calculations with approximate potential functions. These methods should guide experimental studies to improve the affinities and physicochemical properties of antibodies. Finally, several successful examples of in silico structure-based antibody designs are reviewed. We also briefly review structure-based antigen or immunogen design, with application to rational vaccine development.",antibody design;antibody engineering;protein therapeutics;vaccine design

We investigated the single-molecule fluorescence intermittency of the main component of the PSII antenna (LHCII) under conditions that mimic efficient use of light or qE, and we demonstrate that weakly fluorescing states are stabilized under qE conditions. Thus, we propose that qE is explained by biological control over the intrinsic dynamic disorder in the complex—the frequencies of switching establish whether the population of complexes is unquenched or quenched. Furthermore, the quenched states were accompanied by two distinct spectral signatures, suggesting more than one mechanism for energy dissipation in LHCII.",

FEN1 processes 5′ flaps through a previously unknown, but structurally elegant double-stranded (ds) recognition/single stranded (ss) incision mechanism that both selects for 5′ flaps and selects against ss DNA or RNA, intact dsDNA, and 3′ flaps. Two major DNA binding interfaces, including a K+ bridge between the DNA and the H2TH motif, are spaced one helical turn apart and together select for substrates with dsDNA. A conserved helical gateway and a helical cap protects the two-metal active site and selects for ss flaps with free termini. Structures of substrate and product reveal an unusual step between binding substrate and incision that involves a double base unpairing with incision occurring in the resulting unpaired DNA or RNA. Ordering of the active site requires a disorder-to-order transition induced by binding of an unpaired 3′ flap, which ensures that the product is ligatable. Comparison with FEN superfamily members, including XPG, EXO1, and GEN1, identifies superfamily motifs such as the helical gateway that select for ss-dsDNA junctions and provides key biological insights into nuclease specificity and regulation.",Structure-specific nuclease;two metal;DNA binding;replication;DNA repair;flap endonuclease

They are thioredoxin-dependent peroxidases under low oxidative stress, and ATP-independent chaperones upon exposure to high peroxides concentrations. These alternative functions have been associated with changes in the oligomerization state from low (LMW) to high (HMW) molecular weight species. Here we present the structures of Schistosoma mansoni PrxI in both states: the LMW decamer and the HMW 20-mer, formed by two stacked decamers. The latter is the first structure of a 2-Cys Prx chaperonic form.

The normal function of most Treg cells requires sustained expression of functional FOXP3, a member of the FOXP family transcription factors. FOXP3 is distinct from other subfamily members because of its unique proline rich amino (N)-terminal domain. Mutations in this region are occasionally identified in certain patients with X-linked autoimmunity–allergic dysregulation syndrome (XLAAD) and similar mutations also increase susceptibility of autoimmune diseases in rodent models. Previous analyses of the FOXP3 N- domain revealed a role in nuclear import, interaction with other transcription factors, and as sites of specific post-translational modifications of FOXP3 that contribute to FOXP3 stability.",

However, this concept cannot be totally true. In three well documented studies, we have demonstrated that cancer tissues produce order zones that evolve over time and generate embryoid body structures in a space-time interval. The authors decided to revise the macroscopic and microscopic material in well-developed malignant tumors in which embryoid bodies were identified to determine the phenotype characterization that serves as a guideline for easy recognition. The factors responsible for this morphogenesis are physical, bioelectric, and magnetic susceptibilities produced by crystals that act as molecular designers for the topographic gradients that guide the surrounding silhouette and establish tissue head-tail positional identities. The structures are located in amniotic-like cavities and show characteristic somite-like embryologic segmentation. Immunophenotypic study has demonstrated exclusion factor positional identity in relation to enolase-immunopositive expression of embryoid body and human chorionic gonadotropin immunopositivity exclusion factor expression in the surrounding tissues. The significance of these observations is that they can also be predicted by experimental image data collected by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) accelerator at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, in which two-beam subatomic collision particles in the resulting debris show hyperorder domains similar to those identified by us in intercellular cancer collisions. Our findings suggest that we are dealing with true reverse biologic system information in an activated collective cancer stem cell memory, in which physics participates in the elaboration of geometric complexes and chiral biomolecules that serve to build bodies with embryoid print as it develops during gestation. Reversal mechanisms in biology are intimately linked with DNA repair.

Precisely what directs site selection of these DSBs is hotly debated and in particular it is unclear which chromatin features, and regulatory factors are necessary for a genomic region to initiate and resolve DSBs as a crossover (CO) event. In human and mouse, one layer of hotspot selection control is a recognition sequence element present at these sites that is bound by the Prdm9 zinc-finger protein. Furthermore, an overall open chromatin structure is thought to be required to allow access of the recombination machinery, and this is often dictated by the packaging of DNA around nucleosomes. We recently defined the nucleosome occupancy maps of four mouse recombination hotspots throughout meiosis. These analyses revealed no obvious dynamic changes in nucleosome occupancy, suggesting an intrinsic nature of recombinogenic sites, yet they also revealed that nucleosomes define zones of exclusion for CO resolution. Here, we discuss new evidence implicating nucleosome occupancy in recombinogenic repair and its potential roles in controlling chromatin structure at mouse meiotic hotspots.",meiosis;chromatin;nucleosome;recombination;Prdm9;histone;crossover

Among the many environmental alterations that have occurred in our recent history is the ever-increasing dyssynchrony between natural cycles of light/dark and altered patterns of sleep/wake and eating behavior associated with our “24-hour” lifestyle. An extensive research literature has established clear links between increased risk for obesity and both sleep deprivation and shift work, and our understanding of the consequences of such dyssynchrony at the molecular level is beginning to emerge.

Yet no molecular model has been computationally tested that takes into account the individual contributions of all these regions. Constant velocity, steered molecular dynamics studies at 0.025 Å/ps were conducted on the folded fibrinogen core and the α-C domain to determine their force-displacement behavior. A wormlike chain model with a persistence length of 0.8 nm (Kuhn length = 1.6 nm) was used to model the mechanical behavior of the unfolded α-C connector. The three components were combined to calculate the total stress-strain response, which was then compared to experimental data.

This truncated protein is a catalytically active construct, including an N-terminal extension of 60 residues prior to the kinase domain, the kinase domain, and 20 residues afterward. The structure reveals that the NIK kinase domain assumes an active conformation in the absence of any phosphorylation. Analysis of the structure uncovers a unique role for the N-terminal extension sequence, which stabilizes helix αC in the active orientation and keeps the kinase domain in the catalytically competent conformation. Our findings shed light on the long-standing debate over whether NIK is a constitutively active kinase.

Here, we report that the recently described nuclear protein, Pax2 transactivation domain interaction protein (PTIP)-associated protein 1 (PA1), is a new inhibitor of GR transactivation. PA1 suppresses Amax, increases the EC50, and reduces the PAA of an exogenous reporter gene in a manner that is independent of associated PTIP. PA1 is fully active with, and strongly binds to, the C-terminal half of GR. PA1 reverses the effects of the coactivator TIF2 on GR-mediated gene induction but is unable to augment the actions of the corepressor SMRT. Analysis of competition assays between PA1 and TIF2 with an exogenous reporter indicates that the kinetic definition of PA1 action is a competitive decelerator at two sites upstream from where TIF2 acts. With the endogenous genes IGFBP1 and IP6K3, PA1 also represses GR induction, increases the EC50, and decreases the PAA. ChIP and re-ChIP experiments indicate that PA1 accomplishes this inhibition of the two genes via different mechanisms as follows: PA1 appears to increase GR dissociation from and reduce GR transactivation at the IGFBP1 promoter regions but blocks GR binding to the IP6K3 promoter. We conclude that PA1 is a new competitive decelerator of GR transactivation and can act at more than one molecularly defined step in a manner that depends upon the specific gene.",Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChiP);Coregulator Transcription;Gene Regulation;Glucocorticoid Receptor;Steroid Hormone Receptor;PA1;Competition Assay Defines Kinetic Nature of Action;Competitive Decelerator;Gene-specific Mechanism of PA1 Action;Inhibitor of GR Transactivation at Two Steps

Uncertainty regarding the mechanistic relationship between Aβ oligomer and fibril formation and the cytotoxicity of these aggregate species persists. β-Turn formation has been proposed to be a potential rate limiting step during Aβ fibrillogenesis. The effect of turn nucleation on Aβ self-assembly was probed by systematically replacing amino acid pairs in the putative turn region of Aβ (residues 24–27) with d-ProGly, an effective turn nucleating motif. The kinetic, thermodynamic, and cytotoxic effects of these mutations were characterized. It was found that turn formation dramatically accelerated Aβ fibril self-assembly dependent on the site of turn nucleation. The cytotoxicity of the three d-ProGlycontaining Aβ variants was significantly lower than that of wild-type Aβ40, presumably due to decreased oligomer populations as a function of more rapid progression to mature fibrils; oligomer populations were not eliminated, however, suggesting that turn formation is also a feature of oligomer structures. These results indicate that turn nucleation is a critical step in Aβ40 fibril formation.",Amyloid-β;turn nucleation;Alzheimer’s disease;β-hairpin;fibril self-assembly

Nearly all bacteria utilize a unique type II topoisomerase, gyrase, which actively adds negative supercoils to chromosomes using an ATP-dependent DNA strand passage mechanism; however, the specific activities of these enzymes can vary markedly from species to species. Escherichia coli gyrase is known to favor supercoiling over decatenation (Zechiedrich, E. L., Khodursky, A. B., and Cozzarelli, N. R. (1997) Genes Dev. 11, 2580–2592), whereas the opposite has been reported for Mycobacterium tuberculosis gyrase (Aubry, A., Fisher, L. M., Jarlier, V., and Cambau, E. (2006) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 348, 158–165). Here, we set out to understand the molecular basis for these differences using structural and biochemical approaches. Contrary to expectations based on phylogenetic inferences, we find that the dedicated DNA wrapping domains (the C-terminal domains) of both gyrases are highly similar, both architecturally and in their ability to introduce writhe into DNA. However, the M. tuberculosis enzyme lacks a C-terminal control element recently uncovered in E. coli gyrase (see accompanying article (Tretter, E. M., and Berger, J. M. (2012) J. Biol. Chem. 287, 18636–18644)) and turns over ATP at a much slower rate. Together, these findings demonstrate that C-terminal domain shape is not the sole regulatory determinant of gyrase activity and instead indicate that an inability to tightly couple DNA wrapping to ATP turnover is why M. tuberculosis gyrase cannot supercoil DNA to the same extent as its γ-proteobacterial counterpart. Our observations demonstrate that gyrase has been modified in multiple ways throughout evolution to fine-tune its specific catalytic properties.",DNA-binding Protein;DNA Topoisomerase;DNA Topology;Protein-DNA Interaction;Protein Evolution;Chromosome Dynamics

As such, the cortex is both primed to mature normally and at risk for re-organizing abnormally, depending upon numerous factors that determine central maturation. From a clinical perspective, at least two major components of development can be manipulated: 1) input to the cortex and 2) the timing of cortical input. Children with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) have provided a model of early deprivation of sensory input to the cortex, and demonstrated the resulting plasticity and development that can occur upon introduction of stimulation.

The conformation of a 22-bp canonical response element containing an AT spacer between the two half-sites is unaltered compared with that containing a TA spacer, exhibiting superhelical trajectory. In contrast, a GC spacers abolishes the DNA superhelical trajectory and exhibits less bent DNA, suggesting that increased GC content accompanies increased double helix rigidity. A 19-bp DNA, representing an AT-rich response element with overlapping half-sites, maintains superhelical trajectory and reveals two interacting p63DBD dimers crossing one another at 120°. p63DBD binding assays to response elements of increasing length complement the structural studies.
