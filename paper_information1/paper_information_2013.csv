Failure to do so might lead to their accumulation and aggregation, a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases. Protein quality control pathways play a major role in the degradation of these proteins, which is mediated mainly by the ubiquitin proteasome system. Despite significant focus on identifying ubiquitin ligases involved in these pathways, along with their substrates, a systems-level understanding of these pathways has been lacking. For instance, as misfolded proteins are rapidly ubiquitylated, unconjugated ubiquitin is rapidly depleted from the cell upon misfolding stress; yet it is unknown whether certain targets compete more efficiently to be ubiquitylated. Using a system-wide approach, we applied statistical and computational methods to identify characteristics enriched among proteins that are further ubiquitylated after heat shock. We discovered that distinct populations of structured and, surprisingly, intrinsically disordered proteins are prone to ubiquitylation. Proteomic analysis revealed that abundant and highly structured proteins constitute the bulk of proteins in the low-solubility fraction after heat shock, but only a portion is ubiquitylated. In contrast, ubiquitylated, intrinsically disordered proteins are enriched in the low-solubility fraction after heat shock. These proteins have a very low abundance in the cell, are rarely encoded by essential genes, and are enriched in binding motifs. In additional experiments, we confirmed that several of the identified intrinsically disordered proteins were ubiquitylated after heat shock and demonstrated for two of them that their disordered regions are important for ubiquitylation after heat shock. We propose that intrinsically disordered regions may be recognized by the protein quality control machinery and thereby facilitate the ubiquitylation of proteins after heat shock.",

NMR spectroscopy is especially well-suited for the study of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) which are in general highly flexible and do not have a well-defined secondary or tertiary structure under functional conditions. In the last decade, the important role of IDPs in many essential cellular processes has become more evident as the lack of a stable tertiary structure of many protagonists in signal transduction, transcription regulation and cell-cycle regulation has been discovered. The growing demand for structural data of IDPs required the development and adaption of methods such as 13C-direct detected experiments, paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs) or residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) for the study of ‘unstructured’ molecules in vitro and in-cell. The information obtained by NMR can be processed with novel computational tools to generate conformational ensembles that visualize the conformations IDPs sample under functional conditions.

In contrast to stably folded proteins, IDPs often form compact conformations at acidic pH. The biological relevance of this process was, for example, demonstrated by nuclear magnetic resonance studies of the aggregation prone (low pH) state of α-synuclein. In this study, we report a large-scale analysis of the pH dependence of disordered proteins using the recently developed meta-structure approach. The meta-structure analysis of a large set of IDPs revealed a significant tendency of IDPs to form α-helical secondary structure elements and to preferentially fold into more compact structures under acidic conditions. The predictive validity of this novel approach was demonstrated with applications to the tumor-suppressor BASP1 and the transcription factor Tcf4.",intrinsically disordered proteins;protein meta-structure;pH dependence;structural biology;biomolecular NMR;EPR spectroscopy

Both ordered and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are natural polypeptides that use the same arsenal of 20 proteinogenic amino acid residues as their major building blocks. The exceptional structural plasticity of IDPs, their capability to exist as heterogeneous structural ensembles and their wide array of important disorder-based biological functions that complements functional repertoire of ordered proteins are all rooted within the peculiar differential usage of these building blocks by ordered proteins and IDPs. In fact, some residues (so-called disorder-promoting residues) are noticeably more common in IDPs than in sequences of ordered proteins, which, in their turn, are enriched in several order-promoting residues. Furthermore, residues can be arranged according to their “disorder promoting potencies,” which are evaluated based on the relative abundances of various amino acids in ordered and disordered proteins. This review continues a series of publications on the roles of different amino acids in defining the phenomenon of protein intrinsic disorder and concerns glutamic acid, which is the second most disorder-promoting residue.",glutamic acid;intrinsically disordered protein;protein function;protein structure;protein-protein interaction

The new IDEAL incorporates the interactions of IDPs and their binding partners more explicitly, and illustrates the protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks and the structures of protein complexes. Redundant experimental data are arranged based on the clustering of Protein Data Bank entries, and similar sequences with the same binding mode are grouped. As a result, the new IDEAL presents more concise and informative experimental data. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) disorder is annotated in a systematic manner, by identifying the regions with large deviations among the NMR models. The ordered/disordered and new domain predictions by DICHOT are available, as well as the domain assignments by HMMER. Some examples of the PPI networks and the highly deviated regions derived from NMR models will be described, together with other advances. These enhancements will facilitate deeper understanding of IDPs, in terms of their flexibility, plasticity and promiscuity.",

However, general study of IDPs by NMR spectroscopy is limited by the poor 1H-amide chemical shift dispersion typically observed in their spectra. Recently, 13C direct-detected NMR spectroscopy has been recognized as enabling broad structural study of IDPs. Most notably, multi-dimensional experiments based on the 15N,13C-CON spectrum make complete chemical shift assignment feasible. Here we document a collection of NMR based tools that efficiently lead to chemical shift assignment of IDPs, motivated by a case study of the C-terminal disordered region from the human pancreatic transcription factor Pdx1. Our strategy builds on the combination of two 3D experiments, (HN-flip)N(CA)CON and 3D (HN-flip)N(CA)NCO, that enable daisy-chain connections to be built along the IDP backbone, facilitated by acquisition of amino-acid specific 15N,13C-CON detected experiments. Assignments are completed through carbon-detected, TOCSY based side chain chemical shift measurement.

Sequences of these intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and IDP regions (IDPRs) are characterized by a number of specific features, such as low overall hydrophobicity and high net charge which makes these proteins predictable. IDPs/IDPRs possess large hydrodynamic volumes, low contents of ordered secondary structure, and are characterized by high structural heterogeneity. They are very flexible, but some may undergo disorder to order transitions in the presence of natural ligands. The degree of these structural rearrangements varies over a very wide range. IDPs/IDPRs are tightly controlled under the normal conditions and have numerous specific functions that complement functions of ordered proteins and domains. When lacking proper control, they have multiple roles in pathogenesis of various human diseases. Gaining structural and functional information about these proteins is a challenge, since they do not typically “freeze” while their “pictures are taken.” However, despite or perhaps because of the experimental challenges, these fuzzy objects with fuzzy structures and fuzzy functions are among the most interesting targets for modern protein research.

IDPs are characterized by an astonishing structural and functional diversity that defines their ability to be universal regulators of various cellular pathways. Programmed cell death (PCD) is one of the most intricate cellular processes where the cell uses specialized cellular machinery and intracellular programs to kill itself. This cell-suicide mechanism enables metazoans to control cell numbers and to eliminate cells that threaten the animal's survival. PCD includes several specific modules, such as apoptosis, autophagy, and programmed necrosis (necroptosis). These modules are not only tightly regulated but also intimately interconnected and are jointly controlled via a complex set of protein–protein interactions. To understand the role of the intrinsic disorder in controlling and regulating the PCD, several large sets of PCD-related proteins across 28 species were analyzed using a wide array of modern bioinformatics tools. This study indicates that the intrinsic disorder phenomenon has to be taken into consideration to generate a complete picture of the interconnected processes, pathways, and modules that determine the essence of the PCD. We demonstrate that proteins involved in regulation and execution of PCD possess substantial amount of intrinsic disorder. We annotate functional roles of disorder across and within apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis processes. Disordered regions are shown to be implemented in a number of crucial functions, such as protein–protein interactions, interactions with other partners including nucleic acids and other ligands, are enriched in post-translational modification sites, and are characterized by specific evolutionary patterns. We mapped the disorder into an integrated network of PCD pathways and into the interactomes of selected proteins that are involved in the p53-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway.",intrinsically disordered proteins;programmed cell death;protein–protein interaction;interaction network;protein structure;protein function;molecular recognition

The exchange rates of these fast exchanging amides are usually faster than the shortest time scale (10s) employed in typical automated HDX-MS experiments. Considering the functional importance of IDPs and their association with many diseases, it is valuable to develop methods that allow the study of solution dynamics of these proteins as well as the ability to probe the interaction of IDPs with their wide range of binding partners. Here, we report the application of time window expansion to the millisecond range by altering the on-exchange pH of the HDX experiment to study a well characterized IDP; the activation domain of the nuclear receptor coactivator, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α). This method enabled mapping the regions of PGC-1α that are stabilized upon binding the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). We further demonstrate the method’s applicability to other binding partners of the IDP PGC-1α and pave the way for characterizing many other biologically important ID proteins.",Hydrogen deuterium exchange;automation;electrospray ionization;HPLC;mass spectrometry;nuclear receptors;intrinsically disorder;proteins;conformational mobility;protein dynamics

Owing to the inherent flexibility of IDPs, solution techniques are particularly appropriate for characterizing their biophysical properties, and structural ensembles in agreement with these data provide a convenient tool for describing the underlying conformational sampling. Database entries consist of (i) primary experimental data with descriptions of the acquisition methods and algorithms used for the ensemble calculations, and (ii) the structural ensembles consistent with these data, provided as a set of models in a Protein Data Bank format. PE-DB is open for submissions from the community, and is intended as a forum for disseminating the structural ensembles and the methodologies used to generate them. While the need to represent the IDP structures is clear, methods for determining and evaluating the structural ensembles are still evolving. The availability of the pE-DB database is expected to promote the development of new modeling methods and leads to a better understanding of how function arises from disordered states.",

At the core of the circadian transcription/translation feedback loop in Neurospora crassa is the protein Frequency (FRQ), shown here shown to share many characteristics of IDPs. FRQ in turn binds to Frequency Interacting RNA Helicase (FRH), whose clock function has been assumed to relate to its predicted helicase function. However, mutational analyses reveal that the helicase function of FRH is not essential for the clock, and a region of FRH distinct from the helicase region is essential for stabilizing FRQ against rapid degradation via pathway distinct from its typical ubiquitin-mediated turnover. These data lead to the hypothesis that FRQ is an IDP and that FRH acts nonenzymatically, stabilizing FRQ to enable proper clock circuitry/function.",

Here we analyze distributions and clusters of PID regions in 193024 members of the version 23.0 Pfam seed database.

Cluster analyses of domains with mean VSL2b scores greater than 0.5 (half predicted disorder or more) show at least 3 separated groups.

However, there is growing concern that such a deterministic view is not entirely consistent with multiple lines of evidence which indicate that cancer can arise in the absence of mutations and can even be reversed to normalcy despite the mutations.

It does, however, show a strong propensity to fold into more ordered structures under a wide range of conditions. Partial folding was produced by increasing temperature (in a reversible process), contrary to the behavior of most soluble proteins. Furthermore, significant folding was observed in the presence of negatively charged lipids and detergents, but not in zwitterionic or neutral lipids or detergents. Absorption onto a surface followed by dehydration stimulated it to fold into a helical structure, as it did when the aqueous solution was replaced by nonaqueous solvents. Hydration of the dehydrated folded protein was accompanied by complete unfolding.

Numerous key autophagy effectors and regulators have been identified, but the mechanism by which they carry out their function in autophagy is not fully understood. Our rigorous bioinformatic analysis shows that the majority of key human autophagy proteins include intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which are sequences lacking stable secondary and tertiary structure; suggesting that IDRs play an important, yet hitherto uninvestigated, role in autophagy. Available crystal structures corroborate the absence of structure in some of these predicted IDRs. Regions of orthologs equivalent to the IDRs predicted in the human autophagy proteins are poorly conserved, indicating that these regions may have diverse functions in different homologs. We also show that IDRs predicted in human proteins contain several regions predicted to facilitate protein-protein interactions, and delineate the network of proteins that interact with each predicted IDR-containing autophagy protein, suggesting that many of these interactions may involve IDRs. Lastly, we experimentally show that a BCL2 homology 3 domain (BH3D), within the key autophagy effector BECN1 is an IDR. This BH3D undergoes a dramatic conformational change from coil to α-helix upon binding to BCL2s, with the C-terminal half of this BH3D constituting a binding motif, which serves to anchor the interaction of the BH3D to BCL2s. The information presented here will help inform future in-depth investigations of the biological role and mechanism of IDRs in autophagy proteins.",autophagy;natively unstructured proteins;protein interactions;sequence analysis;BECN1;BH3 domain;BCL2

Although experiments suggest that the conformations of IDPs can vary from random coils, semi-compact globules, to compact globules with different contents of secondary structures, computational efforts to separate IDPs into different states are not yet successful. Recently, we developed a neural-network-based disorder prediction technique SPINE-D that was ranked as one of the top performing techniques for disorder prediction in the biannual meeting of critical assessment of structure prediction techniques (CASP 9, 2010). Here, we further analyze the results from SPINE-D prediction by defining a semi-disordered state that has about 50 % predicted probability to be disordered or ordered. This semi-disordered state is partially collapsed with intermediate levels of predicted solvent accessibility and secondary structure content. The relative difference in compositions between semi-disordered and fully disordered regions is highly correlated with amyloid aggregation propensity (a correlation coefficient of 0.86 if excluding four charged residues and proline, 0.73 if not). In addition, we observed that some semi-disordered regions participate in induced folding, and others play key roles in protein aggregation. More specifically, a semi-disordered region is amyloidogenic in fully unstructured proteins (such as alpha-synuclein and Sup35) but prone to local unfolding that exposes the hydrophobic core to aggregation in structured globular proteins (such as SOD1 and lysozyme). A transition from full disorder to semi-disorder at about 30–40 Qs is observed in the poly-Q (poly-glutamine) tract of huntingtin. The accuracy of using semi-disorder to predict binding-induced folding and aggregation is compared with several methods trained for the purpose. These results indicate the usefulness of three-state classification (order, semi-disorder, and full-disorder) in distinguishing nonfolding from induced-folding and aggregation-resistant from aggregation-prone IDPs and in locating weakly stable, locally unfolding, and potentially aggregation regions in structured proteins. A comparison with five representative disorder-prediction methods showed that SPINE-D is the only method with a clear separation of semi-disorder from ordered and fully disordered states.",Intrinsically disordered proteins;Induced folding;Amyloid formation;Poly-Q;SOD1

The two only places for conformational ensembles of under‐folded (or partially folded) protein forms in this picture were either the end points of the protein denaturation processes or transiently populated folding intermediates. Recent years witnessed dramatic change in this perception and conformational ensembles, which the under‐folded proteins are, have moved from the shadow. Accumulated to date data suggest that a protein can exist in at least three global forms–functional and folded, functional and intrinsically disordered (nonfolded), and nonfunctional and misfolded/aggregated. Under‐folded protein states are crucial for each of these forms, serving as important folding intermediates of ordered proteins, or as functional states of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and IDP regions (IDPRs), or as pathology triggers of misfolded proteins. Based on these observations, conformational ensembles of under‐folded proteins can be classified as transient (folding and misfolding intermediates) and permanent (IDPs and stable misfolded proteins). Permanently under‐folded proteins can further be split into intentionally designed (IDPs and IDPRs) and unintentionally designed (misfolded proteins). Although intrinsic flexibility, dynamics, and pliability are crucial for all under‐folded proteins, the different categories of under‐foldedness are differently encoded in protein amino acid sequences. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We analyzed the biogenesis of three unstructured neuropeptide hormones and observed that translocation of these precursors into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is critically dependent on the presence of the prodomain. The hormone domains could be deleted from the precursors without interfering with ER import and secretion, whereas constructs lacking the prodomain remained in the cytosol. Domain-swapping experiments revealed that the activity of the prodomains to promote productive ER import resides in their ability to adopt an α-helical structure. Removal of the prodomain from the precursor did not interfere with co-translational targeting of the nascent chain to the Sec61 translocon but with its subsequent productive translocation into the ER lumen. Our study reveals a novel function of prodomains to enable import of small or intrinsically disordered secretory proteins into the ER based on their ability to adopt an α-helical conformation.",Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER);Intrinsically Disordered Proteins;Neuropeptide;Neuroscience;Protein Folding

Almost 50% of PDB structures are now known to have one or more regions of disorder, which are involved in diverse functions. These regions typically possess low aromatic content and sequence complexity as well as high net charge and flexibility. In this study, we examined the composition and contribution of intrinsic disorder in outer membrane β barrel protein functions. Our systematic analysis to find the dual personality (DP) fragments, which often function by disorder–order transitions, revealed the presence of 61 DP fragments with 234 residues in β barrel trans membrane protein structures. It was found that though the disorder is more prevalent in the periplasmic regions, most of the residues which undergo disorder–order transitions are found in the extracellular regions. For example, the calcium binding sites in BtuB protein are found to undergo disorder to order transition upon binding calcium. The conformational change in the cell receptor binding site of the OpcA protein, which is important in host cell interactions of N. meningitidis, was also found to be due to the disorder–order transitions occurring in the presence of the ligand. The natively disordered nature of DP fragments makes it more appropriate to call them “functional fragments of disorder.” The present study provides insight into the roles played by intrinsically disordered regions in outer membrane protein functions.",bacterial outer membrane;BtuB protein;intrinsic disorder;OpcA protein;transmembrane protein;functional fragments of disorder;dual personality fragments

One way that cells respond to oxidants is through the action of redox-regulated proteins. These proteins also play important roles in oxidant signaling and protein biogenesis events. The key sensors built into redox-regulated proteins are cysteines, which undergo reversible thiol oxidation in response to changes in the oxidation status of the cellular environment. In this review, we discuss three examples of redox-regulated proteins found in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. These proteins use oxidation of their redox-sensitive cysteines to reversibly convert large structural domains into more disordered regions or vice versa.

These proteins challenge the tenets of the structure-function paradigm and their functional mechanisms remain a mystery given that they fail to fold autonomously into specific structures. Solving this mystery requires a first principles understanding of the quantitative relationships between information encoded in the sequences of disordered proteins and the ensemble of conformations they sample. Advances in quantifying sequence-ensemble relationships have been facilitated through a four-way synergy between bioinformatics, biophysical experiments, computer simulations, and polymer physics theories.

The correlation analysis approach was applied to realistic datasets, which revealed correlations among some physical-chemical properties (charge-hydropathy plot, packing density, pairwise energy).

One potential means by which this can occur is the disorder is transient in nature. That is, the disorder exists just long enough for it to be bound by a partner biomolecule and fold. A review of 30 y of studies of calmodulin’s activation of calcineurin suggests that the regulatory domain of this vital phosphatase is a transiently disordered region. During activation, the regulatory domain progresses from a folded state, to disordered, followed by folding upon being bound by calmodulin. The transient disordered state of this domain is part of a critical intermediate state that facilitates the rapid binding of calmodulin. Building upon “fly-casting” as a means of facilitating partner binding, the mechanism by which calcineurin undergoes activation and subsequent deactivation could be considered “catch and release.”",proteases;chaperones;degradation;misfolding;calmodulin;intrinsically disordered region;phosphatase

Despite the lack of structure, IDPs play important roles in biological processes and transition from disorder to order upon binding to their targets. With multiple conformational states and rapid conformational dynamics, they engage in myriad and often “promiscuous” interactions. These stochastic interactions between IDPs and their partners, defined here as conformational noise, is an inherent characteristic of IDP interactions. The collective effect of conformational noise is an ensemble of protein network configurations, from which the most suitable can be explored in response to perturbations, conferring protein networks with remarkable flexibility and resilience. Moreover, the ubiquitous presence of IDPs as transcriptional factors and, more generally, as hubs in protein networks, is indicative of their role in propagation of transcriptional (genetic) noise. As effectors of transcriptional and conformational noise, IDPs rewire protein networks and unmask latent interactions in response to perturbations. Thus, noise-driven activation of latent pathways could underlie state-switching events such as cellular transformation in cancer. To test this hypothesis, we created a model of a protein network with the topological characteristics of a cancer protein network and tested its response to a perturbation in presence of IDP hubs and conformational noise. Because numerous IDPs are found to be epigenetic modifiers and chromatin remodelers, we hypothesize that they could further channel noise into stable, heritable genotypic changes.",intrinsically disordered proteins;noise;protein-protein interaction network;state-switching;cancer;evolution

These transcripts harbor the Rev Response Element (RRE), which orchestrates the interaction with the Rev ARM and the successive Rev-dependent mRNA export pathway. Based on established criteria for predicting intrinsic disorder, such as hydropathy, combined with significant net charge, the very basic primary sequences of ARMs are expected to adopt coil-like structures. Thus, we initiated this study to investigate the conformational changes of the Rev ARM associated with RNA binding. We used multidimensional NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopy to monitor the observed structural transitions, and described the conformational landscapes using statistical ensemble and molecular-dynamics simulations.

The C-terminal globular domain (CTD) of B23 has been believed to be the RNA binding domain because the splicing variant B23.2 lacking the CTD binds considerably less efficiently to RNA. However, the recognition of target RNAs by B23 remains poorly understood. Herein, we report a novel mechanism by which B23 recognizes specific RNA targets. We observed that the nucleolar retention of B23.3 lacking the basic region of B23.1 was lower than that of B23.1 because of its low RNA binding activity. Circular dichroism measurements indicated that the basic region and adjacent acidic regions of B23 are intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Biochemical analyses revealed that the basic IDR alone strongly binds to RNA with low specificity. The excessive RNA binding activity of the basic IDR was restrained by intra-molecular interaction with the acidic IDR of B23. Chemical cross-linking experiments and fluorescent labeling of bipartite tetracysteine-tagged proteins suggested that the inter- and intra-molecular interactions between the two IDRs contribute to the regulation of the RNA binding activity of CTD to control the cellular localization and functions of B23.",

Keith Dunker: ude.iupui@reknudek ","The classical ‘lock-and-key’ and ‘induced-fit’ mechanisms for binding both originated in attempts to explain features of enzyme catalysis. For both of these mechanisms and for their recent refinements, enzyme catalysis requires exquisite spatial and electronic complementarity between the substrate and the catalyst. Thus, binding models derived from models originally based on catalysis will be highly biased towards mechanisms that utilize structural complementarity. If mere binding without catalysis is the endpoint, then the structural requirements for the interaction become much more relaxed. Recent observations on specific examples suggest that this relaxation can reach an extreme lack of specific 3D structure, leading to molecular recognition with biological consequences that depend not only upon structural and electrostatic complementarity between the binding partners but also upon kinetic, entropic, and generalized electrostatic effects. In addition to this discussion of binding without fixed structure, examples in which unstructured regions carry out important biological functions not involving molecular recognition will also be discussed. Finally, we discuss whether ‘intrinsically disordered protein’ (IDP) represents a useful new concept.",

Uversky: ude.fsu.htlaeh@yksrevuv ","Recent studies revealed that a significant fraction of any given proteome is presented by proteins that do not have unique 3D structures as a whole or in significant parts. These intrinsically disordered proteins possess dramatic structural and functional variability, being especially enriched in signaling and regulatory functions since their lack of fixed structure defines their ability to be involved in interaction with several proteins and allows them to be re-used in multiple pathways. Among recognized disorder-based protein functions are interactions with nucleic acids and multi-target binding; i.e., the functions ascribed to many spliceosomal proteins. Therefore, the spliceosome, a multimegadalton ribonucleoprotein machine catalyzing the excision of introns from eukaryotic pre-mRNAs, represents an attractive target for the focused analysis of the abundance and functionality of intrinsic disorder in its proteinaceous components. In yeast cells, spliceosome consists of five small nuclear RNAs (U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6) and a range of associated proteins. Some of these proteins constitute cores of the corresponding snRNA-protein complexes known as small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). Other spliceosomal proteins have various auxiliary functions. To gain better understanding of the functional roles of intrinsic disorder, we have studied the prevalence of intrinsically disordered proteins in the yeast spliceosome using a wide array of bioinformatics methods. Our study revealed that similar to the proteins associated with human spliceosomes (Korneta & Bujnicki, 2012), proteins found in the yeast spliceosome are enriched in intrinsic disorder.",Spliceosome;Intrinsically disordered protein;Protein structure;RNA–protein complex;Protein–protein interaction;Intrinsic disorder;Protein–RNA interaction;Protein hub;Splicing;Protein function

E-mail: zn.ca.dnalkcua@notsgnik.lr","Abstract: Proteins are often classified in a binary fashion as either structured or disordered. However this approach has several deficits. Firstly, protein folding is always conditional on the physiochemical environment. A protein which is structured in some circumstances will be disordered in others. Secondly, it hides a fundamental asymmetry in behavior. While all structured proteins can be unfolded through a change in environment, not all disordered proteins have the capacity for folding. Failure to accommodate these complexities confuses the definition of both protein structural domains and intrinsically disordered regions. We illustrate these points with an experimental study of a family of small binding domains, drawn from the RNA polymerase of mumps virus and its closest relatives. Assessed at face value the domains fall on a structural continuum, with folded, partially folded, and near unstructured members. Yet the disorder present in the family is conditional, and these closely related polypeptides can access the same folded state under appropriate conditions. Any heuristic definition of the protein domain emphasizing conformational stability divides this domain family in two, in a way that makes no biological sense. Structural domains would be better defined by their ability to adopt a specific tertiary structure: a structure that may or may not be realized, dependent on the circumstances. This explicitly allows for the conditional nature of protein folding, and more clearly demarcates structural domains from intrinsically disordered regions that may function without folding.",intrinsic protein disorder;protein stability;coupled binding and folding;stabilizing osmolytes;trimethylamine N-oxide;rubulaviruses;mumps virus;RNA-dependent RNA polymerase

We review this phenomenon in detail, and suggest that phase transitions of actin regulatory proteins, neurofilament side-arms and other proteins could generate non-uniform spatial distribution of cytoplasmic material in the vicinity of the cytoskeleton that might even give rise to fixation phenomena resembling the MTL. Whether such hydrogel formation by IDPs is a general physical phenomenon, will remain to be seen, nevertheless, the underlying organizational principle provokes novel experimental studies to uncover the ensuing higher-level regulation of cell physiology, in which the despised and long-forgotten concept of MTL might give some interesting leads.",intrinsic protein disorder;unstructured protein;hydrogel transition;sol-gel transition;phase transition;low-complexity region;multivalent

However, the structural interpretation of the observables obtained by various measurements is not always straightforward and in many cases dynamics-related parameters are only used to “decorate” static structural models without offering explicit description of conformational heterogeneity. To overcome such limitations, several computational techniques have been developed to generate ensemble-based representations of protein structure and dynamics with the use of NMR-derived data. An important common aspect of the methods is that NMR observables and derived parameters are interpreted as properties of the ensemble instead of individual conformers. The resulting ensembles reflect the experimentally determined internal mobility of proteins at a given time scale and can be used to understand the role of internal motions in biological processes at atomic detail. In this review we provide an overview of the calculation methods currently available and examples of biological insights obtained by the ensemble-based models of the proteins investigated.",dynamic structural ensembles;protein NMR spectroscopy;protein mobility;molecular dynamics simulation;ensemble generation

The majority of signaling pathways involve an extensive set of protein-protein interactions, and phosphorylation is widely used to regulate protein-protein binding by affecting the stability, kinetics and specificity of interactions. Previously it was found that phosphorylation sites tend to be located on protein-protein binding interfaces and may orthosterically modulate the strength of interactions. Here we studied the effect of phosphorylation on protein binding in relation to intrinsic disorder for different types of human protein complexes with known structure of binding interface. Our results suggest that the processes of phosphorylation, binding and disorder-order transitions are coupled to each other, with about one quarter of all disordered interface Ser/Thr/Tyr sites being phosphorylated. Namely, residue site disorder and interfacial states significantly affect the phosphorylation of serine and to a lesser extent of threonine. Tyrosine phosphorylation might not be directly associated with binding through disorder, and is often observed in ordered interface regions which are not predicted to be disordered in the unbound state. We analyze possible mechanisms of how phosphorylation might regulate protein-protein binding via intrinsic disorder, and specifically focus on how phosphorylation could prevent disorder-order transitions upon binding.",

E-mail ude.cmt.htu@uyhS.niB-nnA","Cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) C1 recruits different interacting partners to regulate mRNA fate. The majority of PABP-interacting proteins contain a PAM2 motif to mediate their interactions with PABPC1. However, little is known about the regulation of these interactions or the corresponding functional consequences. Through in silico analysis, we found that PAM2 motifs are generally embedded within an extended intrinsic disorder region (IDR) and are located next to cluster(s) of potential serine (Ser) or threonine (Thr) phosphorylation sites within the IDR. We hypothesized that phosphorylation at these Ser/Thr sites regulates the interactions between PAM2-containing proteins and PABPC1. In the present study, we have tested this hypothesis using complementary approaches to increase or decrease phosphorylation. The results indicate that changing the extent of phosphorylation of three PAM2-containing proteins (Tob2, Pan3, and Tnrc6c) alters their ability to interact with PABPC1. Results from experiments using phospho-blocking or phosphomimetic mutants in PAM2-containing proteins further support our hypothesis. Moreover, the phosphomimetic mutations appreciably affected the functions of these proteins in mRNA turnover and gene silencing. Taken together, these results provide a new framework for understanding the roles of intrinsically disordered proteins in the dynamic and signal-dependent control of cytoplasmic mRNA functions.",PABP;PAM2 motif;intrinsically disordered region;GW182;miRNA function;translation;mRNA turnover;protein phosphorylation;deadenylation

These autogenous associations represent important regulatory mechanisms that control gene expression at the translational level. Using the catRAPID approach to predict the propensity of proteins to bind to RNA, we investigated the occurrence of autogenous associations in the human proteome. Our algorithm correctly identified binding sites in well-known cases such as thymidylate synthase, tumor suppressor P53, synaptotagmin-1, serine/ariginine-rich splicing factor 2, heat shock 70 kDa, ribonucleic particle-specific U1A and ribosomal protein S13. In addition, we found that several other proteins are able to bind to their own mRNAs. A large-scale analysis of biological pathways revealed that aggregation-prone and structurally disordered proteins have the highest propensity to interact with cognate RNAs. These findings are substantiated by experimental evidence on amyloidogenic proteins such as TAR DNA-binding protein 43 and fragile X mental retardation protein. Among the amyloidogenic proteins, we predicted that Parkinson’s disease-related α-synuclein is highly prone to interact with cognate transcripts, which suggests the existence of RNA-dependent factors in its function and dysfunction. Indeed, as aggregation is intrinsically concentration dependent, it is possible that autogenous interactions play a crucial role in controlling protein homeostasis.",

Also, there is a widely spread phenomenon of conditional (functional or transient) disorder, where functions of many ordered proteins require local or even global unfolding of their unique structures. Finally, extrinsic disorder (i.e., intrinsic disorder in functional partners of ordered proteins) should be taken into account too.

This review aims at presenting in an accessible manner the requirements and limitations of this technique. As an introduction, the history of NMR will highlight how the method evolved from physics to chemistry and finally to biology over several decades. We then introduce the NMR spectral parameters used in structural biology, namely the chemical shift, the J-coupling, nuclear Overhauser effects, and residual dipolar couplings. Resonance assignment, the required step for any further NMR study, bears a resemblance to jigsaw puzzle strategy. The NMR spectral parameters are then converted into angle and distances and used as input using restrained molecular dynamics to compute a bundle of structures. When interpreting a NMR-derived structure, the biologist has to judge its quality on the basis of the statistics provided. When the 3D structure is a priori known by other means, the molecular interaction with a partner can be mapped by NMR: information on the binding interface as well as on kinetic and thermodynamic constants can be gathered. NMR is suitable to monitor, over a wide range of frequencies, protein fluctuations that play a crucial role in their biological function. In the last section of this review, intrinsically disordered proteins, which have escaped the attention of classical structural biology, are discussed in the perspective of NMR, one of the rare available techniques able to describe structural ensembles.

A major obstacle has been the current lack of understanding about the function and structure of the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain that contains a major regulatory transcriptional activation function (AF1). Current studies of both mechanism of action and small molecule-selective receptor modulators for clinical uses target the structured pocket of the ligand-binding domain to modulate coregulatory protein interactions with the other activation function AF2. However, these approaches overlook AF1 activity. Recent studies have shown that highly flexible intrinsically disordered regions of transcription factors, including that of the N-terminal domain AF1 of NRs, not only are critical for several aspects of NR action but also can be exploited as drug targets, thereby opening unique opportunities for endocrine-based therapies. In this review article, we discuss the role of structural flexibilities in the allosteric modulation of NR activity and future perspectives for therapeutic interventions.",

Although the cellular readout of these interactions and the formation of these complexes have been thoroughly described, no attempt was made to study these interactions in detail, and to elucidate the thermodynamic, kinetic, and structural underpinning of this range of moonlighting functions. Because Tβ4 is mostly disordered, and its 4 described partners are structurally unrelated (the CTD of stabilin-2 is actually fully disordered), it occurred to us that this system might be ideal to characterize the structural adaptability and ensuing moonlighting functions of IDPs.

Plant IDPs play critical roles in plant biology and often act as integrators of signals from multiple plant regulatory and environmental inputs. Binding promiscuity and plasticity allow IDPs to interact with multiple partners in protein interaction networks and provide important functional advantages in molecular recognition through transient protein–protein interactions. Short interaction-prone segments within IDPs, termed molecular recognition features, represent potential binding sites that can undergo disorder-to-order transition upon binding to their partners. In this review, we summarize the evidence for the importance of IDPs in plant biology and evaluate the functions associated with intrinsic disorder in five different types of plant protein families experimentally confirmed as IDPs. Functional studies of these proteins illustrate the broad impact of disorder on many areas of plant biology, including abiotic stress, transcriptional regulation, light perception, and development. Based on the roles of disorder in the protein–protein interactions, we propose various modes of action for plant IDPs that may provide insight for future experimental approaches aimed at understanding the molecular basis of protein function within important plant pathways.",

The main function of these proteins is to control and regulate cell cycle in response to various cellular signals, and therefore to control the organism’s development. The regulatory functions of the p53 family members originate mostly from their highly-conserved and well-structured DNA-binding domains. Many human diseases (including various types of cancer) are related to the missense mutations within this domain. The ordered DNA-binding domains of the p53 family members are surrounded by functionally important intrinsically disordered regions. In this study, substitution rates and propensities in different regions of p53 were analyzed. The analyses revealed that the ordered DNA-binding domain is conserved, whereas disordered regions are characterized by high sequence diversity. This diversity was reflected both in the number of substitutions and in the types of substitutions to which each amino acid was prone. These results support the existence of a positive correlation between protein intrinsic disorder and sequence divergence during the evolutionary process. This higher sequence divergence provides strong support for the existence of disordered regions in p53 in vivo for if they were structured, they would evolve at similar rates as the rest of the protein.",intrinsically disordered proteins;protein evolution;protein-protein interactions;protein-DNA interaction;p53 family

Generally, NMR experiments using the out-and-back coherence transfer with amide proton detection are affected by fast HX and result in reduced signal intensity. When one of these experiments, 1H-15N HSQC, is used to measure the 15N transverse relaxation rate (R2), the measured R2 rate is convoluted with the HX rate (kHX) and has higher apparent R2 values. Since the 15N R2 measurement is important for analyzing protein backbone dynamics, the HX effect on the R2 measurement is investigated and described here by multi-exponential signal decay. We demonstrate these effects by performing 15N R2CPMG experiments on α-synuclein, an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), in which the amide protons are exposed to solvent. We show that the HX effect on R2CPMG can be extracted by the derived equation. In conclusion, the HX effect may be pulse sequence specific and results from various sources including the J coupling evolution, the change of steady state water proton magnetization, and the D2O content in the sample. To avoid the HX effect on the analysis of relaxation data of unprotected amides, it is suggested that NMR experimental conditions insensitive to the HX should be considered or that intrinsic R2CPMG values be obtained by methods described herein.",Hydrogen exchange;intrinsically disordered protein;15N R2 relaxation

These modular proteins often manipulate host physiology by directly interfering with immune signaling of plant cells. Even if host cells have developed efficient strategies to perceive the presence of pathogenic microbes and to recognize intracellular effector activity, it remains an open question why only few effectors are recognized directly by plant resistance proteins. Based on in-silico genome-wide surveys and a reevaluation of published structural data, we estimated that bacterial effectors of phytopathogens are highly enriched in long-disordered regions (>50 residues). These structurally flexible segments have no secondary structure under physiological conditions but can fold in a stimulus-dependent manner (e.g., during protein–protein interactions). The high abundance of intrinsic disorder in effectors strongly suggests positive evolutionary selection of this structural feature and highlights the dynamic nature of these proteins. We postulate that such structural flexibility may be essential for (1) effector translocation, (2) evasion of the innate immune system, and (3) host function mimicry. The study of these dynamical regions will greatly complement current structural approaches to understand the molecular mechanisms of these proteins and may help in the prediction of new effectors.",

Yet despite decades of effort, the molecular-level mechanisms defining this protective function remain unknown. A recent effort to understand LEA functionality began with the unique application of phage display, wherein phage display and biopanning over recombinant Seed Maturation Protein homologs from Arabidopsis thaliana and Glycine max were used to retrieve client proteins at two different temperatures, with one intended to represent heat stress. From this previous study, we identified 21 client proteins for which clones were recovered, sometimes repeatedly. Here, we use sequence analysis and homology modeling of the client proteins to ascertain common sequence and structural properties that may contribute to binding affinity with the protective LEA protein. Our methods uncover what appears to be a predilection for protein-nucleic acid interactions among LEA client proteins, which is suggestive of subcellular residence. The results from this initial computational study will guide future efforts to uncover the protein protective mechanisms during heat stress, potentially leading to phage-display-directed evolution of synthetic LEA molecules.",

Many members of this important group of proteins have a distinct biological function and frequently undergo a conformational change on binding to their physiological targets which can in turn modulate their function. Furthermore, many intrinsically unstructured proteins are associated with a wide range of major diseases including cancer and amyloid-related disorders. Here, electrospray ionisation-ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (ESI-IMS-MS) has been used to probe the conformational characteristics of two intrinsically disordered proteins: apo-cytochrome c and apo-osteocalcin. Both proteins are structured in their holo-states when bound to their respective substrates, but disordered in their apo-states. Here, the conformational properties of the holo- and the apo-protein forms for both species have been analysed and their mass spectral data and ion mobility spectrometry-derived collision cross-sectional areas, indicative of their physical size, compared to study the relationship between substrate binding and tertiary structure. In both cases, the intrinsically unstructured apo-states populated multiple conformations with larger cross-sectional areas than their holo-analogues, suggesting that intrinsic disorder in proteins does not preclude the formation of preferred conformations. Additionally, analysis of truncated analogues of osteocalcin has located the region of the protein responsible for the conformational changes detected upon metal cation binding. Together, the data illustrate the scope and utility of ESI-IMS-MS for studying the characteristics and properties of intrinsically disordered proteins whose analysis by other techniques is limited.",Collision cross-sectional areas;cytochrome c;electrospray ionisation;intrinsically disordered proteins;ion mobility spectrometry;mass spectrometry;osteocalcin.

PGC-1α expression is tightly regulated, it is a highly labile protein, and it interacts with various proteins—the known attributes of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). In this study, we characterize PGC-1α as an IDP and demonstrate that it is susceptible to 20S proteasomal degradation by default. We further demonstrate that PGC-1α degradation is inhibited by NQO1, a 20S gatekeeper protein. NQO1 binds and protects PGC-1α from degradation in an NADH-dependent manner. Using different cellular physiological settings, we also demonstrate that NQO1-mediated PGC-1α protection plays an important role in controlling both basal and physiologically induced PGC-1α protein level and activity. Our findings link NQO1, a cellular redox sensor, to the metabolite-sensing network that tunes PGC-1α expression and activity in regulating energy metabolism.",

We develop a Bayesian framework to infer the ensemble properties of an IDP using a combination of conformations generated by MD simulations and its measured infrared spectrum. We performed 100 different MD simulations totaling more than 10 µs to characterize the conformational ensemble of αsynuclein, a prototypical IDP, in water. These conformations are clustered based on solvent accessibility and helical content. We compute the amide-I band for these clusters and predict the thermodynamic weights of each cluster given the measured amide-I band. Bayesian analysis produces a reproducible and non-redundant set of thermodynamic weights for each cluster, which can then be used to calculate the ensemble properties. In a rigorous validation, these weights reproduce measured chemical shifts.",Intrinsically disordered proteins;Fourier transform-infrared spectrum;Bayesian analysis;Conformational ensembles

It was previously shown that a peptide (peptide E) corresponding to the association of two basic clusters of core enhances the annealing and the dimerization of nucleic acid fragments derived from a stem loop (SL2) in the 3′ untranslated region of the hepatitis C virus genome. However, strong aggregation of nucleic acids by core or peptide E in the excess of the latter precluded the characterization of their binding parameters up to now. By careful design of surface plasmon resonance experiments, we obtained accurate binding parameters for the interaction of peptide E with SL2-derived oligonucleotides of different lengths and sequences, in form of stem-loop, duplex or strand. Peptide E was found to bind in a salt dependent manner to all oligonucleotides assayed. Affinity data identify at least two binding modes, of which one is independent of sequence/structure, and the other is specific to the SL2 stem-loop fold. Stoichiometry data support a multi-motif binding model allowing formation of higher-order complexes. We propose that the modular binding mode demonstrated for structured RNA-binding proteins also applies to this disordered chaperone and is relevant to its activity.",

Morris;David Live;Christian Gruta,Corresponding author.,"While chemical shift prediction has played an important role in aspects of protein NMR that include identification of secondary structure, generation of torsion angle constraints for structure determination, and assignment of resonances in spectra of intrinsically disordered proteins, interest has arisen more recently in using it in alternate assignment strategies for crosspeaks in 1H-15N HSQC spectra of sparsely labeled proteins. One such approach involves correlation of crosspeaks in the spectrum of the native protein with those observed in the spectrum of the denatured protein, followed by assignment of the peaks in the latter spectrum. As in the case of disordered proteins, predicted chemical shifts can aid in these assignments. Some previously developed empirical formulas for chemical shift prediction have depended on basis data sets of 20 pentapeptides. In each case the central residue was varied among the 20 amino common acids, with the flanking residues held constant throughout the given series. However, previous choices of solvent conditions and flanking residues make the parameters in these formulas less than ideal for general application to denatured proteins. Here, we report 1H and 15N shifts for a set of alanine based pentapeptides under the low pH urea denaturing conditions that are more appropriate for sparse label assignments. New parameters have been derived and a Perl script was created to facilitate comparison with other parameter sets. A small, but significant, improvement in shift predictions for denatured ubiquitin is demonstrated.",sparse labeling;disordered proteins;denatured proteins;NMR;resonance assignments

Cambridge, Lensfield Road, Cambridge, CB2 1EW, U.K.;Email: ku.ca.mac@261cj","Association (at 1–0.25 μM) was effectively irreversible
for all solvent conditions. If the reaction were truly ‘diffusion-limited’
the helicity of PUMA should not affect the speed of the reaction as all conformations, if colliding with the correct orientation,
would successfully lead to the final complex. Given that the temperature
and urea dependence of k+ suggest that
this is not the case, then the conformations of the IDP must be examined.
Due to the complications of the peptide oligomerizing at concentrations
greater than 2 μM, many experimental techniques to quantify
residual structure were not feasible. However, CD could still be used
to give a measure of the α-helical content in the unbound state.
Qualitatively, the peptide was less helical at higher temperatures
(Figure S9). This ‘melting’
of PUMA’s helicity could alter the effective radius of the
PUMA peptide and could complicate the analysis of the temperature
dependence. However, as mentioned above, eq 1 and eq 2 are relatively insensitive to the
radii of the proteins and this effect is unlikely to explain the results
seen above (see Supporting Information).
The intrinsic helicity of PUMA showed little ionic strength dependence
but was reduced in the presence of urea (Figure
S9). It is interesting to note that at higher temperatures
association was faster than expected, despite the reduced helicity
of the peptide, whereas the reverse was true for the peptide in the
presence of denaturant. Thus, there is no clear relationship between
solvent induced changes in helicity and association rate constant.",

The splicing reaction removes non-coding regions (introns) and ligates coding regions (exons). The spliceosome is a highly dynamic ribonucleoprotein complex that undergoes dramatic structural changes during its assembly, the catalysis and its disassembly. The transitions between the different steps during the splicing cycle are promoted by eight conserved DExD/H box ATPases. The DEAH-box protein Prp43 is responsible for the disassembly of the intron-lariat spliceosome and its helicase activity is activated by the G-patch protein Ntr1. Here, we investigate the activation of Prp43 by Ntr1 in the presence and absence of RNA substrate by functional assays and structural proteomics. Residues 51–110 of Ntr1 were identified to be the minimal fragment that induces full activation. We found protein–protein cross-links that indicate that Prp43 interacts with the G-patch motif of Ntr1 through its C-terminal domains. Additionally, we report on functionally important RNA binding residues in both proteins and propose a model for the activation of the helicase.",

In some instances, the disordered nature of one of the binding partners severely hampers the success of co-crystallization, often leading to the crystallization of just one of the partners. Here, we discuss a method to trap weak and transient protein interactions for crystallization. This approach requires the structural details of at least one of the interacting partners and binding knowledge to dock the known minimum binding region (peptide) of the protein onto the other using an optimal-sized linker. Prior to crystallization, the purified linked construct should be verified for its intact folding and stability. Following structure determination, structure-guided functional studies are performed with independent, full-length unlinked proteins to validate the findings of the linked complex. We designed this approach and then validated its efficacy using a 24 amino acid minimum binding region of the intrinsically disordered, neuron-specific substrates, Neurogranin and Neuromodulin, joined via a Gly-linker to their interacting partner, Calmodulin. Moreover, the reported functional studies with independent full-length proteins confirmed the findings of the linked peptide complexes. Based on our studies, and in combination with the supporting literature, we suggest that optimized linkers can provide an environment to mimic the natural interactions between binding partners, and offer a useful strategy for structural studies to trap weak and transient interactions involved in several biological processes.",Protein-protein interactions;transient binding;linked complex;co-crystallization

While prokaryotic and archeal species usually have one or two sirtuin homologs, in humans as well as in eukaryotes we found multiple versions and in mammals this family is comprised of seven different homologous proteins being all NAD-dependent de-acylases. 3D structures of human SIRT2, SIRT3, and SIRT5 revealed the overall conformation of the conserved core domain but they were unable to give a structural information about the presence of very flexible and dynamically disordered regions, the role of which is still structurally and functionally unclear. Recently, we modeled the 3D-structure of human SIRT1, the most studied member of this family, that unexpectedly emerged as a member of the intrinsically disordered proteins with its long disordered terminal arms. Despite clear similarities in catalytic cores between the human sirtuins little is known of the general structural characteristics of these proteins. The presence of disorder in human SIRT1 and the propensity of these proteins in promoting molecular interactions make it important to understand the underlying mechanisms of molecular recognition that reasonably should involve terminal segments. The mechanism of recognition, in turn, is a prerequisite for the understanding of any functional activity.

The intrinsically disordered matrix protein ameloblastin (AMBN) is the most abundant nonamelogenin protein of the developing enamel and a key element for correct enamel formation. AMBN was suggested to be a cell adhesion molecule that regulates proliferation and differentiation of ameloblasts. Nevertheless, detailed structural and functional studies on AMBN have been substantially limited by the paucity of the purified nondegraded protein. With this study, we have developed a procedure for production of a highly purified form of recombinant human AMBN in quantities that allowed its structural characterization.

Recent theoretical1 and empirical2 observations indicate that allostery is also manifest in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which account for a significant proportion of the proteome3,4. Many IDPs are promiscuous binders that interact with multiple partners and frequently function as molecular hubs in protein interaction networks. The adenovirus early region 1A (E1A) oncoprotein is a prime example of a molecular hub IDP5. E1A can induce drastic epigenetic reprogramming of the cell within hours after infection, through interactions with a diverse set of partners that include key host regulators like the general transcriptional coactivator CREB binding protein (CBP), its paralog p300, and the retinoblastoma protein (pRb)6,7. Little is known about the allosteric effects at play in E1A-CBP-pRb interactions, or more generally in hub IDP interaction networks. Here, we utilized single-molecule Förster/fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to study coupled binding and folding processes in the ternary E1A system. The low concentrations used in these high-sensitivity experiments proved essential for these studies, which are challenging due to a combination of E1A aggregation propensity and high-affinity binding interactions. Our data revealed that E1A-CBP-pRb interactions display either positive or negative cooperativity, depending on the available E1A interaction sites. This striking cooperativity switch enables fine-tuning of the thermodynamic accessibility of the ternary vs. binary E1A complexes, and may permit a context-specific tuning of associated downstream signaling outputs. Such a modulation of allosteric interactions is likely a common mechanism in molecular hub IDP function.",adenovirus E1A;p300/CBP;retinoblastoma protein;intrinsically disordered protein;allostery;single-molecule fluorescence

Many enzymes and receptors can be switched “on” or “off” by conformational changes induced by phosphorylation. The phosphorylation process is mediated by a family of enzymes called kinase. Currently, more than 1,000 different kinases have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana proteome. Kinases interact with each other and with many regulatory proteins forming phosphorylation networks. These phosphorylation networks modulate the signaling processes and control the functions of cells. Normally, kinases phosphorylate serines, threonines, and tyrosines. However, in many proteins, not all of these 3 types of amino acids can be phosphorylated. Therefore, identifying the phosphorylation sites and the possible phosphorylation events is very important in decoding the processes of regulation and the function of phosphorylation networks. In this study, we applied computational and bioinformatics tools to characterize the association between phosphorylation events and structural properties of corresponding proteins by analyzing more than 50 trans-membrane proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana. In addition to the previously established conclusion that phosphorylation sites are closely associated with intrinsic disorder, we found that the phosphorylation process may also be affected by solvent accessibility of phosphorylation sites and further promoted by neighboring modification events.",phosphorylation;structural flexibility;intrinsic disorder;relative surface accessibility

To understand its putative interaction with other histone ligands, we have characterized its ability to bind H3-H4 and histone octamers. We find that the chaperone forms distinct complexes with histones, which differ in the number of molecules that build the assembly and in their spatial distribution. When complexed with H3-H4 tetramers or histone octamers, two NP pentamers form an ellipsoidal particle with the histones located at the center of the assembly, in stark contrast with the NP/H2A-H2B complex that contains up to five histone dimers bound to one chaperone pentamer. This particular assembly relies on the ability of H3-H4 to form tetramers either in solution or as part of the octamer, and it is not observed when a variant of H3 (H3C110E), unable to form stable tetramers, is used instead of the wild-type protein. Our data also suggest that the distal face of the chaperone is involved in the interaction with distinct types of histones, as supported by electron microscopy analysis of the different NP/histone complexes. The use of the same structural region to accommodate all type of histones could favor histone exchange and nucleosome dynamics.",

Here we describe an approach for modeling IDPs with similar sequences that simplifies the comparison of the ensembles by utilizing a single library of structures. The relative population weights of the structures are estimated using a Bayesian formalism, which provides measures of uncertainty in the resulting ensembles. We applied this approach to the comparison of ensembles for Aβ40 and Aβ42. Bayesian hypothesis testing finds that although both Aβ species sample β-rich conformations in solution that may represent prefibrillar intermediates, the probability that Aβ42 samples these prefibrillar states is roughly an order of magnitude larger than the frequency in which Aβ40 samples such structures. Moreover, the structure of the soluble prefibrillar state in our ensembles is similar to the experimentally determined structure of Aβ that has been implicated as an intermediate in the aggregation pathway. Overall, our approach for comparative studies of IDPs with similar sequences provides a platform for future studies on the effect of mutations on the structure and function of disordered proteins.",

The structural characterization of such states has so far largely relied on ensemble representations, which in principle account for both their local and global structural features. However, these approaches are inherently of low resolution due to the large number of degrees of freedom of conformational ensembles and to the sparse nature of the experimental data used to determine them. Here, we overcome these limitations by showing that tertiary interactions in disordered states can be mapped at high resolution by fitting paramagnetic relaxation enhancement data to a small number of conformations, which can be as low as one. This result opens up the possibility of determining the topology of cooperatively collapsed and hidden folded states when these are present in the vast conformational landscape accessible to disordered states of proteins. As a first application, we study the long-range tertiary interactions of acid-unfolded apomyoglobin from experimentally measured paramagnetic relaxation enhancement data.",

We contend that most intrinsically disordered proteins are in fact proteins waiting for a partner (PWPs), parts of a multi-component complex that do not fold correctly in the absence of other components. Flexibility, not disorder, is an intrinsic property of proteins, exemplified by X-ray structures of many enzymes and protein-protein complexes. Disorder is often observed with purified proteins in vitro and sometimes also in crystals, where it is difficult to distinguish from flexibility. In the crowded environment of the cell, disorder is not compatible with the known mechanisms of protein-protein recognition, and, foremost, with its specificity. The self-assembly of multi-component complexes may, nevertheless, involve the specific recognition of nascent polypeptide chains that are incompletely folded, but then disorder is transient, and it must remain under the control of molecular chaperones and of the quality control apparatus that obviates the toxic effects it can have on the cell.",

Since then, this discovery has offered us and other groups a powerful tool to characterize insoluble proteins, and we have further addressed several fundamental and disease-relevant issues associated with this discovery. Here I review these results, which are conceptualized into several novel scenarios. 1) Unlike 'misfolded proteins', which still retain the capacity to fold into well-defined structures but are misled to 'off-pathway' aggregation, unrefoldable and insoluble proteins completely lack this ability and will unavoidably aggregate in vivo with ~150 mM ions, thus designated as 'intrinsically insoluble proteins (IIPs)' here. IIPs may largely account for the 'wastefully synthesized' DRiPs identified in human cells. 2) The fact that IIPs including membrane proteins are all soluble in unsalted water, but get aggregated upon being exposed to ions, logically suggests that ions existing in the background play a central role in mediating protein aggregation, thus acting as 'dark mediators'. Our study with 14 salts confirms that IIPs lack the capacity to fold into any well-defined structures. We uncover that salts modulate protein dynamics and anions bind proteins with high selectivity and affinity, which is surprisingly masked by pre-existing ions. Accordingly, I modified my previous model. 3) Insoluble proteins interact with lipids to different degrees. Remarkably, an ALS-causing P56S mutation transforms the β-sandwich MSP domain into a helical integral membrane protein. Consequently, the number of membrane-interacting proteins might be much larger than currently recognized. To attack biological membranes may represent a common mechanism by which aggregated proteins initiate human diseases. 4) Our discovery also implies a solution to the 'chicken-and-egg paradox' for the origin of primitive membranes embedded with integral membrane proteins, if proteins originally emerged in unsalted prebiotic media.",

In eukaryotic cells, two major pathways rely on N-terminal signal peptides to target proteins to either the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or mitochondria. In this study, we show that the ER signal peptides of the prion protein-like protein shadoo, the neuropeptide hormone somatostatin and the amyloid precursor protein have the property to mediate alternative targeting to mitochondria. Remarkably, the targeting direction of these signal peptides is determined by structural elements within the nascent chain. Each of the identified signal peptides promotes efficient ER import of nascent chains containing α-helical domains, but targets unstructured polypeptides to mitochondria. Moreover, we observed that mitochondrial targeting by the ER signal peptides correlates inversely with ER import efficiency. When ER import is compromised, targeting to mitochondria is enhanced, whereas improving ER import efficiency decreases mitochondrial targeting. In conclusion, our study reveals a novel mechanism of dual targeting to either the ER or mitochondria that is mediated by structural features within the nascent chain.",endoplasmic reticulum;intrinsically disordered;mitochondria;neurodegeneration;signal peptide

The importance of IDPs in many biological processes has been established but there remain unanswered questions about their evolution and conservation of their disordered state within a protein family. Our group has been studying the structural similarities among orthologous FlgM proteins, a model class of IDPs. We have previously shown that the FlgM protein from the thermophile Aquifex aeolicus has more structure at A. aeolicus' physiological temperature (85 °C) than is observed for the Salmonella typhimurium FlgM, suggesting that the disordered nature of FlgM varies among organisms and is not universally conserved. In this work, we extend these studies to the FlgM proteins from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Bacillus subtilis. We demonstrate that the B. subtilis, E. coli, and S. typhimurium FlgMs exist in a premolten globule-like conformation, though the B. subtilis FlgM is in a more compacted conformation than the other two. The P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis FlgM proteins exist in a currently unknown conformation that is not either coil-like or premolten globule-like. The P. aeruginosa FlgM appears to contain more weak intramolecular contacts given its more compacted state than the P. mirabilis FlgM. These results provide experimental evidence that members of the same protein family can exhibit different degrees of disorder, though understanding how different disordered states evolve in the same protein family will require more study.",FlgM;Intrinsically disordered protein;Circular dichroism;Molten globule

We predicted the structures of hundreds of proteins from a representative set of DNA and LINE transposable elements and used the obtained structural data to provide the first general structural characterization of TE proteins and to estimate the frequency of TE domestication and horizontal transfer events. We show that 1) ORF1 and Gag proteins of retrotransposons contain high amounts of structural disorder; thus, despite their very low conservation, the presence of disordered regions and probably their chaperone function is conserved. 2) The distribution of SCOP classes in DNA transposons and LINEs indicates that the proteins of DNA transposons are more ancient, containing folds that already existed when the first cellular organisms appeared. 3) DNA transposon proteins have lower contact order than randomly selected reference proteins, indicating rapid folding, most likely to avoid protein aggregation. 4) Structure-based searches for TE homologs indicate that the overall frequency of TE domestication events is low, whereas we found a relatively high number of cases where horizontal transfer, frequently involving parasites, is the most likely explanation for the observed homology.",Evolution;Gene Transposable Elements;Intrinsically Disordered Proteins;Protein Evolution;Protein Folding;RNA World;Horizontal Transfer;Transposon Domestication

","Hormone therapies for advanced prostate cancer target the androgen receptor (AR) ligand-binding domain (LBD), but these ultimately fail and the disease progresses to lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The mechanisms that drive CRPC are incompletely understood, but may involve constitutively active AR splice variants that lack the LBD. The AR N-terminal domain (NTD) is essential for AR activity, but targeting this domain with small-molecule inhibitors is complicated by its intrinsic disorder. Here we investigated EPI-001, a small-molecule antagonist of AR NTD that inhibits protein-protein interactions necessary for AR transcriptional activity. We found that EPI analogs covalently bound the NTD to block transcriptional activity of AR and its splice variants and reduced the growth of CRPC xenografts. These findings suggest that the development of small-molecule inhibitors that bind covalently to intrinsically disordered proteins is a promising strategy for development of specific and effective anticancer agents.",

At the protein level, intrinsic structural disorder may be another key element because disordered regions often serve as functional elements that can be effectively integrated into a protein structure. Therefore, we asked whether exon-phase symmetry in the human genome and structural disorder in the human proteome are connected, signalling such evolutionary mechanisms in the assembly of multi-exon genes. We found an elevated level of structural disorder of regions encoded by symmetric exons and a preferred symmetry of exons encoding for mostly disordered regions (>70% predicted disorder). Alternatively spliced symmetric exons tend to correspond to the most disordered regions. The genes of mostly disordered proteins (>70% predicted disorder) tend to be assembled from symmetric exons, which often arise by internal tandem duplications. Preponderance of certain types of short motifs (e.g. SH3-binding motif) and domains (e.g. high-mobility group domains) suggests that certain disordered modules have been particularly effective in exon-shuffling events. Our observations suggest that structural disorder has facilitated modular assembly of complex genes in evolution of the human genome.",

Denatured proteins have been observed to exhibit global geometric properties of a random coil polymer. However, this does not preclude the existence of nonrandom, local conformational bias that may be significant for protein folding and function. Indeed, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and other methods have suggested that the denatured state contains considerable local bias to the polyproline II (PII) conformation. Here, we develop predictive models to determine the extent that temperature and the chemical denaturant urea modulate PII propensity. In agreement with our predictive model, PII propensity is observed experimentally to decrease with an increase in temperature. Conversely, urea appears to promote the PII conformation as determined by CD and isothermal titration calorimetry. Importantly, the calorimetric data are in quantitative agreement with a model that predicts the stability of the PII helix relative to other denatured state conformations based upon solvent accessible surface area and experimentally measured Gibbs transfer free energies. The ability of urea to promote the PII conformation can be attributed to the favorable interaction of urea with the peptide backbone. Thus, perturbing denatured states by temperature or cosolutes has subtle, yet opposing, impacts on local PII conformational biases. These results have implications for protein folding as well as for the function of signaling proteins that bind proline-rich targets in globular or intrinsically disordered proteins.",

NS3 protease activity, located at the N-terminal domain, is a zinc-dependent serine protease. A zinc ion, required for the hydrolytic activity, has been considered as a structural metal ion essential for the structural integrity of the protein. In addition, NS3 interacts with another cofactor, NS4A, an accessory viral protein that induces a conformational change enhancing the hydrolytic activity. Biophysical studies on the isolated protease domain, whose behavior is similar to that of the full-length protein (e.g., catalytic activity, allosteric mechanism and susceptibility to inhibitors), suggest that a considerable global conformational change in the protein is coupled to zinc binding. Zinc binding to NS3 protease can be considered as a folding event, an extreme case of induced-fit binding. Therefore, NS3 protease is an intrinsically (partially) disordered protein with a complex conformational landscape due to its inherent plasticity and to the interaction with its different effectors. Here we summarize the results from a detailed biophysical characterization of this enzyme and present new experimental data.",NS3 protease;protein folding and stability;ligand binding;conformational landscape;intrinsically disordered protein

Molecular oxygen is evolved after four sequential light-driven oxidation reactions at the Mn4CaO5 oxygen-evolving complex, producing five sequentially oxidized states, Sn. PSII is composed of 17 membrane-spanning subunits and three extrinsic subunits, PsbP, PsbQ, and PsbO. PsbO is intrinsically disordered and plays a role in facilitation of the water oxidizing cycle. Native PsbO can be removed and substituted with recombinant PsbO, thereby restoring steady-state activity. In this report, we used reaction-induced Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to obtain information concerning the role of PsbP, PsbQ, and PsbO during the S state cycle. Light-minus-dark difference spectra were acquired, monitoring structural changes associated with each accessible flash-induced S state transition in a highly purified plant PSII preparation (Triton X-100, octylthioglucoside). A comparison of S2 minus S1 spectra revealed that removal of PsbP and PsbQ had no significant effect on the data, whereas amide frequency and intensity changes were associated with PsbO removal. These data suggest that PsbO acts as an organizational template for the PSII reaction center. To identify any coupled conformational changes arising directly from PsbO, global 13C-PsbO isotope editing was employed. The reaction-induced Fourier transform infrared spectra of accessible S states provide evidence that PsbO spectral contributions are temperature (263 and 277 K) and S state dependent. These experiments show that PsbO undergoes catalytically relevant structural dynamics, which are coupled over long distance to hydrogen-bonding changes at the Mn4CaO5 cluster.",Intrinsically Disordered Proteins;Metalloproteins;Photosynthesis;Protein Dynamics;Protein-Protein Interactions;Conformational Landscape

SelS is a member of the endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation pathway but its precise enzymatic function is unknown. Since it contains the rare amino acid selenocysteine, it belongs to the family of selenoproteins, which are typically oxidoreductases. Its exact enzymatic function is key to understanding how the cell regulates the response to oxidative stress and thus influences human health and aging. In order to identify its enzymatic function, we have isolated the selenocysteine-containing enzyme by relying on the aggregation of forms that do not have this reactive residue. That allows us to establish that SelS is primarily a thioredoxin-dependent reductase. It is capable of reducing hydrogen peroxide but is not an efficient or broad-spectrum peroxidase. Only the selenocysteine-containing enzyme is active. In addition, the reduction potential of SelS was determined to be −234 mV using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. This value agrees with SelS being a partner of thioredoxin. Based on this information, SelS can directly combat reactive oxygen species but is also likely to participate in a signaling pathway, via a yet unidentified substrate.",

Phosphorylation of the intrinsically disordered intracellular C-terminal domain alleviates inhibition by extracellular zinc. The mechanism for this functional effect is largely unknown. Proline is a hallmark of intrinsic disorder, so we used proline mutagenesis to modulate disorder in the cytoplasmic domain. Proline depletion selectively uncoupled zinc inhibition with little effect on receptor biogenesis, surface trafficking, or ligand-activated gating. Proline depletion also reduced the affinity for a PDZ domain involved in synaptic trafficking and affected small molecule binding. To understand the origin of these phenomena, we used single molecule fluorescence and ensemble biophysical methods to characterize the structural effects of proline mutagenesis. Proline depletion did not eliminate intrinsic disorder, but the underlying conformational dynamics were changed. Thus, we altered the form of intrinsic disorder, which appears sufficient to affect the biological activity.

We investigated the interaction mechanism of a monoclonal antibody, M1, raised against E7 from human papillomavirus, a prototypic viral oncoprotein and a model intrinsically disordered protein. The mapped 12-amino acid immunodominant epitope lies within a “hinge” region between the N-terminal intrinsically disordered and the C-terminal globular domains. Kinetic experiments show that despite being within an intrinsically disordered region, the hinge E7 epitope has at least two populations separated by a high energy barrier. Nuclear magnetic resonance traced the origin of this barrier to a very slow (t½ ∼4 min) trans-cis prolyl isomerization event involving changes in secondary structure.

In this report, we describe how the activity of the SLIP1-SLBP complex is modulated by phosphorylation and oligomerization. Biophysical characterization of the free proteins shows that whereas SLIP1 is a homodimer that does not bind RNA, human SLBP is an intrinsically disordered protein that is phosphorylated at 23 Ser/Thr sites when expressed in a eukaryotic expression system such as baculovirus. The bacterially expressed unphosphorylated SLIP1-SLBP complex forms a 2:2 high affinity (KD < 0.9 nM) heterotetramer that is also incapable of binding histone mRNA. In contrast, phosphorylated SLBP from baculovirus has weak affinity (KD ~3 µM) for SLIP1. Sequential binding of phosphorylated SLBP to the histone mRNA stem-loop, followed by association with SLIP1 is required to form an “active” ternary complex. Phosphorylation of SLBP at Thr171 promotes dissociation of the heterotetramer to the SLIP1-SLBP heterodimer. Using alanine scanning mutagenesis we demonstrate that the binding site on SLIP1 for SLBP lies close to the dimer interface. A single point mutant near the SLIP1 homodimer interface abolished interaction with SLBP in vitro and reduced histone mRNA abundance in vivo. On the basis of these biophysical studies, we propose that oligomerization and SLBP phosphorylation may regulate the SLBP-SLIP1 complex in vivo. SLIP1 may act to sequester SLBP in vivo protecting it from proteolytic degradation as an inactive hetero-tetramer, or alternatively, formation of the SLIP1-SLBP hetero-tetramer may facilitate removal of SLBP from the histone mRNA prior to histone mRNA degradation.",MIF4GD;translation initiation;oligomerization;intrinsically disordered protein;phosphorylation;histone;SLBP;SLIP1

The extent to which ID proteins take advantage of subtle conformational biases to perform functions, and whether signals for such mechanism can be identified in proteome-wide studies is not well understood. Of particular interest is the polyproline II (PII) conformation, suggested to be highly populated in unfolded proteins. We experimentally determine a complete calorimetric propensity scale for the PII conformation. Projection of the scale into representative eukaryotic proteomes reveals significant PII bias in regions coding for ID proteins. Importantly, enrichment of PII in ID proteins, or protein segments, is also captured by other PII scales, indicating that this enrichment is robustly encoded and universally detectable regardless of the method of PII propensity determination. Gene ontology (GO) terms obtained using our PII scale and other scales demonstrate a consensus for molecular functions performed by high PII proteins across the proteome. Perhaps the most striking result of the GO analysis is conserved enrichment (P < 10−8) of phosphorylation sites in high PII regions found by all PII scales. Subsequent conformational analysis reveals a phosphorylation-dependent modulation of PII, suggestive of a conserved “tunability” within these regions. In summary, the application of an experimentally determined polyproline II (PII) propensity scale to proteome-wide sequence analysis and gene ontology reveals an enrichment of PII bias near disordered phosphorylation sites that is conserved throughout eukaryotes.",intrinsically disordered;phosphorylation;polyproline II;gene ontology;proteome

Previous analyses have focused on extracting the features that frequently appear in protein substructures, such as α-helix and β-sheet, but the universal features of protein sequences have not been addressed. To clarify the differences between native protein sequences and random sequences, we analyzed 7368 soluble, ordered protein sequences, by inspecting the observed and expected occurrences of 400 amino acid pairs in local proximity, up to 10 residues along the sequence in comparison with their expected occurrence in random sequence. We found the trend that the hydrophobic residue pairs and the polar residue pairs are significantly decreased, whereas the pairs between a hydrophobic residue and a polar residue are increased. This trend was universally observed regardless of the secondary structure content but was not observed in protein sequences that include intrinsically disordered regions, indicating that it can be a general rule of protein foldability. The possible benefits of this rule are discussed from the viewpoints of protein aggregation and disorder, which are both caused by low-complexity regions of hydrophobic or polar residues.",sequence analysis;protein structure;secondary structure;protein disorder

The 18.5-kDa isoform that predominates in adult myelin adheres the cytosolic surfaces of oligodendrocyte membranes together, and forms a two-dimensional molecular sieve restricting protein diffusion into compact myelin. However, this protein has additional roles including cytoskeletal assembly and membrane extension, binding to SH3-domains, participation in Fyn-mediated signaling pathways, sequestration of phosphoinositides, and maintenance of calcium homeostasis. Of the diverse post-translational modifications of this isoform, phosphorylation is the most dynamic, and modulates 18.5-kDa MBP’s protein-membrane and protein-protein interactions, indicative of a rich repertoire of functions. In developing and mature myelin, phosphorylation can result in microdomain or even nuclear targeting of the protein, supporting the conclusion that 18.5-kDa MBP has significant roles beyond membrane adhesion. The full-length, early-developmental 21.5-kDa splice isoform is predominantly karyophilic due to a non-traditional P-Y nuclear localization signal, with effects such as promotion of oligodendrocyte proliferation. We discuss in vitro and recent in vivo evidence for multifunctionality of these classic basic proteins of myelin, and argue for a systematic evaluation of the temporal and spatial distributions of these protein isoforms, and their modified variants, during oligodendrocyte differentiation.",cytoskeleton;Fyn-SH3;intrinsically disordered protein;myelin basic protein;oligodendrocyte;phosphorylation

Although dispensable for NEIL1's lesion excision and AP lyase activities, this segment is required for efficient in vivo enzymatic activity and may provide an interaction interface for many of NEIL1's interactions with other base excision repair proteins. Here, we show that the CTD interacts with the folded domain in native NEIL1 containing 389 residues. The CTD is poised for local folding in an ordered structure that is induced in the purified fragment by osmolytes. Furthermore, deletion of the disordered tail lacking both Tyr and Trp residues causes a red shift in NEIL1's intrinsic Trp-specific fluorescence, indicating a more solvent-exposed environment for the Trp residues in the truncated protein, which also exhibits reduced stability compared to the native enzyme. These observations are consistent with stabilization of the native NEIL1 structure via intramolecular, mostly electrostatic, interactions that were disrupted by mutating a positively charged (Lysrich) cluster of residues (amino acids 355–360) near the C-terminus. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis confirms the flexibility and dynamic nature of NEIL1's CTD, a feature that may be critical to providing specificity for NEIL1's multiple, functional interactions.",DNA repair;intrinsically unstructured region;electrostatic interactions;protein stability;oxidative DNA damage

Employing high dimensionality and non-uniform sampling, the novel method allows for the quantification of intraresidue 1H(i)–15N(i)–13C′(i) dipolar–CSA interference in highly overlapped NMR spectra of IDPs. Data obtained on the IDP BASP1 at different pH values illustrated the applicability of the approach to elucidate subtle changes in local backbone geometry under different environmental conditions. Specifically, it was found that in the case of BASP1, lowering the pH induces a population shift of β-turn geometries; at neutral pH, BASP1 predominantly samples type I β turns and polyproline II helices, lowering the pH leads to an increased population of type II β turns accompanied by an unexpected overall compaction of the BASP1 structural ensemble. Given the outstanding sensitivity and spectral resolution of the NMR approach, we envisage useful applications for the characterization of the structural dynamics of IDPs in solution. The detailed data obtained in this study has also provided compelling evidence that intrinsically disordered proteins are characterized by extremely heterogenous energy landscapes, allowing for subtle conformational transitions under changing environmental conditions. Thus, to fully grasp the richness of the structural dynamics of these proteins and their potential role in biological processes, more sophisticated experimental methods as well as theoretical concepts surmounting the conventional order–disorder partitioning are required.",cross-correlated relaxation;intrinsically disordered proteins;multidimensional NMR;NMR spectroscopy;protein structures

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and denatured state ensembles are extreme manifestations of this heterogeneity. Inferences regarding globule versus coil formation can be drawn from analysis of polymeric properties such as average size, shape, and density fluctuations. Here we introduce a new parameter to quantify the degree of conformational heterogeneity within an ensemble to complement polymeric descriptors. The design of this parameter is guided by the need to distinguish between systems that couple their unfolding-folding transitions with coil-to-globule transitions and those systems that undergo coil-to-globule transitions with no evidence of acquiring a homogeneous ensemble of conformations upon collapse. The approach is as follows: Each conformation in an ensemble is converted into a conformational vector where the elements are inter-residue distances. Similarity between pairs of conformations is quantified using the projection between the corresponding conformational vectors. An ensemble of conformations yields a distribution of pairwise projections, which is converted into a distribution of pairwise conformational dissimilarities. The first moment of this dissimilarity distribution is normalized against the first moment of the distribution obtained by comparing conformations from the ensemble of interest to conformations drawn from a Flory random coil model. The latter sets an upper bound on conformational heterogeneity thus ensuring that the proposed measure for intra-ensemble heterogeneity is properly calibrated and can be used to compare ensembles for different sequences and across different temperatures. The new measure of conformational heterogeneity will be useful in quantitative studies of coupled folding and binding of IDPs and in de novo sequence design efforts that are geared toward controlling the degree of heterogeneity in unbound forms of IDPs.",

Herein, we have identified tumor suppressor PTEN as an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) and elucidated the molecular principles by which its intrinsically disordered region (IDR) at the carboxyl-terminus (C-tail) executes its functions. Post-translational modifications, conserved eukaryotic linear motifs and molecular recognition features present in the C-tail IDR enhance PTEN's protein-protein interactions that are required for its myriad cellular functions. PTEN primary and secondary interactomes are also enriched in IDPs, most being cancer related, revealing that PTEN functions emanate from and are nucleated by the C-tail IDR, which form pliable network-hubs. Together, PTEN higher order functional networks operate via multiple IDP-IDP interactions facilitated by its C-tail IDR. Targeting PTEN IDR and its interaction hubs emerges as a new paradigm for treatment of PTEN related pathologies.",

A structural understanding of the allergen-IgE interface is needed to predict cross-reactivities between allergens and to design hypoallergenic proteins. However, there are less than 90 experimentally determined structures available for the approximately 1500 sequences of allergens and isoallergens catalogued in the Structural Database of Allergenic Proteins (SDAP). To provide reliable structural data for the remaining proteins, we previously produced over 500 3D-models using an automated procedure, with strict controls at template choice and model quality evaluation. Here we assessed how well the fold and residue surface exposure of 10 of these models correlated with recently published experimental 3D structures determined by X-ray crystallography or NMR. We also discuss the impact of intrinsically disordered regions on the structural comparison and epitope prediction. Overall, for seven allergens with sequence identities to the original templates higher than 27%, the backbone root-mean square deviations were less than 2Å between the models and the subsequently determined experimental structures for ordered regions. Further, the surface exposure of known IgE epitopes on the models of three major allergens, from peanut (Ara h 1), latex (Hev b 2) and soy (Gly m 4) was very similar to the experimentally determined structures. For three remaining allergens with lower sequence identities to the modeling templates, the 3D folds were correctly identified. However the accuracy of those models is not sufficient for a reliable epitope mapping.",template based modeling;allergenic proteins;IgE epitopes;Structural Database of Allergenic Proteins (SDAP)

This can mediate the E3’s proteasomal degradation. Many E3s have evolved means to avoid autoubiquitination, including protection by partner or substrate binding, preventative modifications, and deubiquitinating enzyme reversal of ubiquitination. Here we describe another adaptation for E3 self-protection discovered while exploring San1, which ubiquitinates misfolded nuclear proteins in yeast for proteasomal degradation. San1 is highly disordered in its substrate-binding regions N- and C-terminal to its RING domain. In cis autoubiquitination could occur if these flexible regions come in proximity to the E2. San1 prevents this by containing no lysines in its disordered regions; thus the canonical residue used for ubiquitin attachment has been selectively eliminated. San1’s target substrates have lost their native structures and expose hydrophobicity. To avoid in trans autoubiquitination, San1 possesses little concentrated hydrophobicity in its disordered regions, and thus the that feature San1 recognizes in misfolded substrates has also been selectively eliminated. Overall the presence of key residues in San1 have been evolutionarily minimized to avoid self-destruction either in cis or in trans. Our work expands the ways in which E3s protect themselves from autoubiquitination.",

Notably, the binding kinetics of disordered proteins are receiving growing attention, with “dock-and-coalescence” emerging as a general mechanism.

In response to ER stress, BiP dissociates from bZIP28, allowing it to be mobilized from the ER to the Golgi where it is proteolytically processed and released to enter the nucleus. Under unstressed conditions, BiP binds to bZIP28 as it binds to other client proteins, through its substrate binding domain. BiP dissociates from bZIP28 even when bZIP28’s exit from the ER or its release from the Golgi is blocked. Both BiP1 and BiP3 bind bZIP28, and overexpression of either BiP detains bZIP28 in the ER under stress conditions. A C-terminally truncated mutant of bZIP28 eliminating most of the lumenal domain does not bind BiP and is not retained in the ER under unstressed conditions. BiP binding sites in the C-terminal tail of bZIP28 were identified in a phage display system. BiP was found to bind to intrinsically disordered regions on bZIP28’s lumen-facing tail.

Structural alignment programs have been developed to unravel such fuzzy relationships. However, none of these structure based methods have used electrostatic properties to discriminate between spatially equivalent residues. We present a methodology for MSA of a set of related proteins with known structures using electrostatic properties as an additional discriminator (STEEP). STEEP first extracts a profile, then generates a multiple structural superimposition providing a consolidated spatial framework for comparing residues and finally emits the MSA. Residues that are aligned differently by including or excluding electrostatic properties can be targeted by directed evolution experiments to transform the enzymatic properties of one protein into another. We have compared STEEP results to those obtained from a MSA program (ClustalW) and a structural alignment method (MUSTANG) for chymotrypsin serine proteases. Subsequently, we used PhyML to generate phylogenetic trees for the serine and metallo-β-lactamase superfamilies from the STEEP generated MSA, and corroborated the accepted relationships in these superfamilies. We have observed that STEEP acts as a functional classifier when electrostatic congruence is used as a discriminator, and thus identifies potential targets for directed evolution experiments. In summary, STEEP is unique among phylogenetic methods for its ability to use electrostatic congruence to specify mutations that might be the source of the functional divergence in a protein family. Based on our results, we also hypothesize that the active site and its close vicinity contains enough information to infer the correct phylogeny for related proteins.",computational biology;phylogenetics;active site prediction;finite difference Poisson-Boltzmann (FDPB);APBS;evolution;multiple sequence alignment;multiple superimposition;directed evolution;structural alignment

Pan1 is also predicted to contain regions of intrinsic disorder, characteristic of proteins that have many binding partners. In vitro biochemical data suggest that Pan1 exists as a dimer, and we have identified amino acids 705–848 as critical for this homotypic interaction. Tryptophan fluorescence was used to further characterize Pan1 conformational states. Pan1 contains four endogenous tryptophans, each in a distinct region of the protein: Trp312 and Trp642 are each in an EH domain, Trp957 is in the central region, and Trp1280 is a critical residue in the Arp2/3 activation domain. To examine the local environment of each of these tryptophans, three of the four tryptophans were mutagenized to phenylalanine to create four proteins, each with only one tryptophan residue. When quenched with acrylamide, these single tryptophan mutants appeared to undergo collisional quenching exclusively and were moderately accessible to the acrylamide molecule. Quenching with iodide or cesium, however, revealed different Stern-Volmer constants due to unique electrostatic environments of the tryptophan residues. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy data confirmed structural and disorder predictions of Pan1. Further experimentation to fully develop a model of Pan1 conformational dynamics will assist in a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of endocytosis.",Pan1;intrinsically disordered protein;EH domain;tryptophan fluorescence quenching;time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy

We showed that the temperature-dependent behavior of FlgM proteins could be separated into two subgroups according to their sequence lengths. Only shorter sequences evolved to adapt to high temperatures (>318 K or 45°C). Their ability to adapt to high temperatures was achieved through a transition from a fully disordered state with little secondary structure to a semidisordered state with high predicted helical probability at the N-terminal region. The predicted results are consistent with available experimental data. An analysis of all orthologous protein families in 39 species suggests that such a transition from a fully disordered state to semidisordered and/or ordered states is one of the strategies employed by nature for adaptation to high temperatures.,

We utilised for this purpose a set of structures of the Aβ42 peptide selected from clusters of conformations within an ensemble generated by molecular dynamics simulations. Using these structures we carried out fragment mapping calculations to identify binding ‘hot spots’ on the monomeric form of the Aβ42 peptide. This procedure provided a set of hot spots with ligand efficiencies comparable to those observed for structured proteins, and that are clustered into binding pockets. We verified that such pockets exhibit a propensity to bind small molecules known to interact with the Aβ42 peptide. Taken together these results provide an initial indication that fragment-based drug discovery may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for diseases associated with the aggregation of intrinsically disordered proteins.",

We examined the interaction of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with the NTD of the progesterone receptor (PR) and its ability to regulate AF1 activity through coupled folding and binding. As assessed by solution phase biophysical methods, the isolated NTD of PR contains a large content of random coil, and it is capable of adopting secondary α-helical structure and more stable tertiary folding either in the presence of the natural osmolyte trimethylamine-N-oxide or through a direct interaction with TBP. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry confirmed the highly dynamic intrinsically disordered property of the NTD within the context of full-length PR. Deletion mapping and point mutagenesis defined a region of the NTD (amino acids 350–428) required for structural folding in response to TBP interaction. Overexpression of TBP in cells enhanced transcriptional activity mediated by the PR NTD, and deletion mutations showed that a region (amino acids 327–428), similar to that required for TBP-induced folding, was required for functional response. TBP also increased steroid receptor co-activator 1 (SRC-1) interaction with the PR NTD and cooperated with SRC-1 to stimulate NTD-dependent transcriptional activity. These data suggest that TBP can mediate structural reorganization of the NTD to facilitate the binding of co-activators required for maximal transcriptional activation.",Intrinsically Disordered Proteins;Mass Spectrometry (MS);Progesterone;Protein Folding;Steroid Hormone Receptor;TATA-binding Protein;N-terminal Transcription Activation domain AF1;Hydrogen Deuterium Exchange Mass;Progesterone Receptor

We present an assay to begin to define the biochemical determinants that regulate dimerization of the cancer-associated oncoprotein AGR2. A two site-sandwich microtiter assay (2SMTA) was designed using a DyLight800-labeled monoclonal antibody that binds to an epitope in AGR2 to screen for synthetic self-peptides that might regulate dimer stability. Peptides derived from the intrinsically disordered N-terminal region of AGR2 increase in trans oligomer stability as defined using the 2SMTA assay. A DSS-crosslinking assay that traps the AGR2 dimer through K95-K95 adducts confirmed that Δ45-AGR2 was a more stable dimer using denaturing gel electrophoresis. A titration of wt-AGR2, Δ45-AGR2 (more stable dimer), and monomeric AGR2E60A revealed that Δ45-AGR2 was more active in binding to Reptin than either wt-AGR2 or the AGR2E60A mutant. Our data have defined a functional role for the AGR2 dimer in the binding to its most well characterized interacting protein, Reptin. The ability to regulate AGR2 oligomerization in trans opens the possibility for developing small molecules that regulate its' biochemical activity as potential cancer therapeutics. The data also highlight the utility of this oligomerization assay to screen chemical libraries for ligands that could regulate AGR2 dimer stability and its' oncogenic potential.",oligomerization;allostery;protein interactions;monoclonal antibody

E‐mail: ac.sdikkcis@namrof, ","Chloride channel gating and trafficking of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) are regulated by phosphorylation. Intrinsically disordered segments of the protein are responsible for phospho‐regulation, particularly the regulatory (R) region that is a target for several kinases and phosphatases. The R region remains disordered following phosphorylation, with different phosphorylation states sampling various conformations. Recent studies have demonstrated the crucial role that intramolecular and intermolecular interactions of the R region play in CFTR regulation. Different partners compete for the same binding segment, with the R region containing multiple overlapping binding elements. The non‐phosphorylated R region interacts with the nucleotide binding domains and inhibits channel activity by blocking heterodimerization. Phosphorylation shifts the equilibrium such that the R region is excluded from the dimer interface, facilitating gating and processing by stimulating R region interactions with other domains and proteins. The dynamic conformational sampling and transient binding of the R region to multiple partners enables complex control of CFTR channel activity and trafficking.",binding;disordered;hub;IDP;post‐translational modification;regulation

Inhibitors of lysine deacetylases (KDACs) exhibit potent antiparasitic activity, suggesting that interference with lysine acetylation pathways hold promise for future drug targeting. Using high resolution LC-MS/MS to identify parasite peptides enriched by immunopurification with acetyl-lysine antibody, we recently produced an acetylome of the proliferative intracellular stage of Toxoplasma. In this study, we used similar approaches to greatly expand the Toxoplasma acetylome by identifying acetylated proteins in non-replicating extracellular tachyzoites. The functional breakdown of acetylated proteins in extracellular parasites is similar to intracellular parasites, with an enrichment of proteins involved in metabolism, translation, and chromatin biology. Altogether, we have now detected over 700 acetylation sites on a wide variety of parasite proteins of diverse function in multiple subcellular compartments. We found 96 proteins uniquely acetylated in intracellular parasites, 216 uniquely acetylated in extracellular parasites, and 177 proteins acetylated in both states. Our findings suggest that dramatic changes occur at the proteomic level as tachyzoites transition from the intracellular to extracellular environment, similar to reports documenting significant changes in gene expression during this transition. The expanded dataset also allowed a thorough analysis of the degree of protein intrinsic disorder surrounding lysine residues targeted for this post-translational modification. These analyses indicate that acetylated lysines in proteins from extracellular and intracellular tachyzoites are largely located within similar local environments, and that lysine acetylation preferentially occurs in intrinsically disordered or flexible regions.",parasite;proteomics;acetylation;lysine;Apicomplexa;tachyzoite

BASH decoupling can be applied in both dimensions of a homonuclear 2D NMR experiment and is particularly useful for enhancing spectral resolution in the HN-Hα region of NOESY spectra of peptides and proteins, which contain important information on the backbone torsion angles. The method then also prevents generation of zero quantum and HNz-Hαz terms, thereby facilitating analysis of intraresidue interactions. Application to the NOESY spectrum of a hexapeptide fragment of the intrinsically disordered protein α-synuclein highlights the considerable diffusion anisotropy present in linear peptides. Removal of residual dipolar couplings between HN and aliphatic protons in weakly aligned proteins increases resolution in the 1H-15N HSQC region of the spectrum and allows measurement of RDCs in samples that are relatively strongly aligned. The approach is demonstrated for measurement of RDCs in protonated 15N/13C-enriched ubiquitin, aligned in Pf1, yielding improved fitting to the ubiquitin structure.",diffusion anisotropy;IDP;residual dipolar coupling;RDC;weak alignment;liquid crystal;NOESY;synuclein;ubiquitin

Cx43CT phospho-mimetic isoforms, which have Asp substitutions at specific Ser/Tyr sites, revealed phosphorylation alters the α-helical content of the Cx43CT domain only when attached to the membrane. The changes in secondary structure are due to variations in the conformational preference and backbone flexibility of residues adjacent and distal to the site(s) of modification.

The WIP C-terminal domain binds to Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) and regulates its activation and degradation, and the WIP-WASp interaction has been shown to be critical for actin polymerization and implicated in the onset of WAS and X-linked thrombocytopenia. WIP is predicted to be an intrinsically disordered protein, a class of polypeptides that are of great interest because they violate the traditional structure-function paradigm. In this first (to our knowledge) study of WIP in its unbound state, we used NMR to investigate the biophysical behavior of WIPC, a C-terminal domain fragment of WIP that includes residues 407–503 and contains the WASp-binding site. In light of the poor spectral dispersion exhibited by WIPC and the high occurrence (25%) of proline residues, we employed 5D-NMR13C-detected NMR experiments with nonuniform sampling to accomplish full resonance assignment. Secondary chemical-shift analysis, 15N relaxation rates, and protection from solvent exchange all concurred in detecting transient structure located in motifs that span the WASp-binding site. Residues 446–456 exhibited a propensity for helical conformation, and an extended conformation followed by a short, capped helix was observed for residues 468–478. The 13C-detected approach allows chemical-shift assignment in the WIPC polyproline stretches and thus sheds light on their conformation and dynamics. The effects of temperature on chemical shifts referenced to a denatured sample of the polypeptide demonstrate that heating reduces the structural character of WIPC. Thus, we conclude that the disordered WIPC fragment is comprised of regions with latent structure connected by flexible loops, an architecture with implications for binding affinity and function.",

Young Dr. South, Room 445, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA;Corresponding author.;David B Teplow: ude.alcu@wolpetd ","According to Thomas Kuhn, the success of ‘normal science,’ the science we all practice on a daily basis, depends on the adherence to, and practice of, a paradigm accepted by the scientific community. When great scientific upheavals occur, they involve the rejection of the current paradigm in favor of a new paradigm that better integrates the facts available and better predicts the behavior of a particular scientific system. In the field of Alzheimer’s disease, a recent example of such a paradigm shift has been the apparent rejection of the ‘amyloid cascade hypothesis,’ promulgated by Hardy and Higgins in 1992 to explain the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease, in favor of what has been referred to as the ‘oligomer cascade hypothesis’. This paradigm shift has been breathtaking in its rapidity, its pervasiveness in the Alzheimer’s disease field, and its adoption in an increasing number of other fields, including those of Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the prionoses. However, these facts do not mean, a priori, that the experiments extant, and any re-interpretation of them, should be accepted by rote as support for the new paradigm. In the discussion that follows, I consider the foundational studies leading to the oligomer cascade hypothesis and evaluate the current state of the paradigm. I argue here that, more often than not, insufficient rigor has been applied in studies upon which this new paradigm has been based. Confusion, rather than clarity, has resulted. If the field is to make progress forward using as its paradigmatic basis amyloid β-protein oligomerization, then an epistemological re-evaluation of the amyloid β-protein oligomer system is required.",

Here, we investigate the structural consequences of phosphorylating serine 381, a covalent modification that turns off F-actin bundling activity. In contrast to the canonical doctrine, in which phosphorylation of an intrinsically disordered region/protein confers affinity for another domain/protein, we found the converse to be true of dematin: phosphorylation of the well folded C-terminal villin-type headpiece confers affinity for its intrinsically disordered N-terminal core domain. We employed analytical ultracentrifugation to demonstrate that dematin is monomeric, in contrast to the prevailing view that it is trimeric. Next, using a series of truncation mutants, we verified that dematin has two F-actin binding sites, one in the core domain and the other in the headpiece domain. Although the phosphorylation-mimicking mutant, S381E, was incapable of bundling microfilaments, it retains the ability to bind F-actin. We found that a phosphorylation-mimicking mutant, S381E, eliminated the ability to bundle, but not bind F-actin filaments. Lastly, we show that the S381E point mutant caused the headpiece domain to associate with the core domain, leading us to the mechanism for cAMP-dependent kinase control of dematin's F-actin bundling activity: when unphosphorylated, dematin's two F-actin binding domains move independent of one another permitting them to bind different F-actin filaments. Phosphorylation causes these two domains to associate, forming a compact structure, and sterically eliminating one of these F-actin binding sites.",Actin;Allosteric Regulation;Analytical Ultracentrifugation;Cytoskeleton;NMR;Protein Kinase A (PKA);Actin-bundling Protein;Band 4.9;Dematin

It is well established that membrane binding is initiated at the N-terminus of the protein and affects biasing of conformational ensembles of αS. However, little is understood about the effect of αS on the membrane lipid bilayer. One hypothesis is that intrinsically disordered αS alters the structural properties of the membrane, thereby stabilizing the bilayer against fusion. Here, we used two-dimensional 13C separated local-field NMR to study interaction of the wild-type αS (wt-αS) or its N-terminal (1–25) amino acid sequence (N-αS) with a cholesterol-enriched ternary membrane system. This lipid bilayer mimics cellular raft-like domains in the brain that are proposed to be involved in neuronal membrane fusion. The 2D dipolar-recoupling pulse sequence DROSS was implemented to measure isotropic 13C chemical shifts and 13C–1H residual dipolar couplings under magic-angle spinning. Site-specific changes in NMR chemical shifts and segmental order parameters indicate that both wt-αS and N-αS bind to the membrane interface and change lipid packing within raft-like membranes. Mean-torque modeling of 13C–1H NMR order parameters shows αS induces a remarkable thinning of the bilayer (≈ 6 Å), accompanied by an increase in phospholipid cross-sectional area (≈ 10 Å2). This perturbation is characterized as membrane annealing and entails structural remodeling of the raft-like liquid-ordered phase. We propose this process is implicated in regulation of synaptic membrane fusion that may be altered by aggregation of αS in Parkinson’s disease.",magic-angle spinning;membrane lipid raft;Parkinson’s disease;residual dipolar coupling;segmental order parameter

Employing high dimensionality and non-uniform sampling, the novel method allows for the quantification of intraresidue 1H(i)–15N(i)–13C′(i) dipolar–CSA interference in highly overlapped NMR spectra of IDPs. Data obtained on the IDP BASP1 at different pH values illustrated the applicability of the approach to elucidate subtle changes in local backbone geometry under different environmental conditions. Specifically, it was found that in the case of BASP1, lowering the pH induces a population shift of β-turn geometries; at neutral pH, BASP1 predominantly samples type I β turns and polyproline II helices, lowering the pH leads to an increased population of type II β turns accompanied by an unexpected overall compaction of the BASP1 structural ensemble. Given the outstanding sensitivity and spectral resolution of the NMR approach, we envisage useful applications for the characterization of the structural dynamics of IDPs in solution. The detailed data obtained in this study has also provided compelling evidence that intrinsically disordered proteins are characterized by extremely heterogenous energy landscapes, allowing for subtle conformational transitions under changing environmental conditions. Thus, to fully grasp the richness of the structural dynamics of these proteins and their potential role in biological processes, more sophisticated experimental methods as well as theoretical concepts surmounting the conventional order–disorder partitioning are required.",Intrinsisch fehlgeordnete Proteine;Kreuzkorrelierte Relaxation;Mehrdimensionale NMR-Spektroskopie;NMR-Spektroskopie;Proteinstrukturen

Even while the chemical shifts fall very close to random coil values, as expected for an intrinsically disordered protein, substantial deviations in the pressure dependence of the chemical shifts are seen relative to those in short model peptides. In particular, the non-linear pressure response of the 1HN chemical shifts, which commonly is associated with the presence of low-lying ""excited states"", is much larger in α-synuclein than in model peptides. The linear pressure response of 1HN chemical shift, commonly linked to H-bond length change, correlates well with those in short model peptides, and is found to be anti-correlated with its temperature dependence. The pressure dependence of 13C chemical shifts shows remarkably large variations, even when accounting for residue type, and do not point to a clear shift in population between different regions of the Ramachandran map. However, a nearly universal decrease in 3JHN-Hα by 0.22 ± 0.05 Hz suggests a slight increase in population of the polyproline II region at 2500 bar. The first six residues of N-terminally acetylated synuclein show a transient ca 15% population of α-helix, which slightly diminishes at 2500 bar. The backbone dynamics of the protein is not visibly affected beyond the effect of slight increase in water viscosity at 2500 bar.",IDP;non-uniform sampling;15N relaxation;random coil;triple resonance

The decoupled hydration state consists of hydrophobic and hydrophilic hydration layers that respond independently to temperature while the coupled hydration state is characterized by a common, cooperative dehydration of both hydration layers. It is further shown that the primary sequence of an ELP can be tuned to exhibit either of the hydration layer coupling modes. Charged side chains lead to decoupling, while strongly hydrophobic side chains trigger stronger interaction between hydrophilic and hydrophobic hydration, leading to coupling of both layers. Further, for aprotic residues this coupling is fostered by decreasing bulkiness of hydrophobic side chains due to larger hydration numbers and water molecules mediating coupling between side chain and backbone hydration shells. For coupled hydration shells, the LCST phase transition characterized by spin probing continuous wave (CW) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is reminiscent of a first order process even on nanoscopic length scales. In contrast, analogous synthetic polymers exhibit nanoscale phase transitions over a broad temperature range, indicating that their nanoscale phase behavior is not of first order. Hence, our results indicate that ELPs are the first identified class of polymers that exhibit a first-order inverse phase transition on nanoscopic length scales. These results may also provide insights into the role of hydration layers in governing the structure-function relationship of intrinsically disordered proteins.",Elastin-like polypeptides;LCST;cooperative dehydration;hydration layer coupling;EPR/ESR;spin probing

It contains 206 essential protein types which were compiled from the literature. For comparison, we generated six proteomes with randomized concentrations. We found that the net charges and molecular weights of the proteins in the minimal genome are not random. The net charge of a protein decreases linearly with molecular weight, with small proteins being mostly positively charged and large proteins negatively charged. The protein copy numbers in the minimal genome have the tendency to maximize the number of protein-protein interactions in the network. Negatively charged proteins which tend to have larger sizes can provide large collision cross-section allowing them to interact with other proteins; on the other hand, the smaller positively charged proteins could have higher diffusion speed and are more likely to collide with other proteins. Proteomes with random charge/mass populations form less stable clusters than those with experimental protein copy numbers. Our study suggests that ‘proper’ populations of negatively and positively charged proteins are important for maintaining a protein-protein interaction network in a proteome.

The sequences, structures and binding specificity between pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins and their pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homology 3 motif only (BH3-only) protein antagonists are now well understood. In contrast, our understanding of the mode of action of Bax and Bak, the two necessary proteins for apoptosis is incomplete. Bax and Bak are isostructural with pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins and also interact with BH3-only proteins, albeit weakly. Two sites have been identified; the in-groove interaction analogous to the pro-survival BH3-only interaction and a site on the opposite molecular face. Interaction of Bax or Bak with activator BH3-only proteins and mitochondrial membranes triggers a series of ill-defined conformational changes initiating their oligomerization and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. Many actions of the mammalian pro-survival Bcl-2 family are mimicked by viruses. By expressing proteins mimicking mammalian pro-survival Bcl-2 family proteins, viruses neutralize death-inducing members of the Bcl-2 family and evade host cell apoptosis during replication. Remarkably, structural elements are preserved in viral Bcl-2 proteins even though there is in many cases little discernible sequence conservation with their mammalian counterparts. Some viral Bcl-2 proteins are dimeric, but they have distinct structures to those observed for mammalian Bcl-2 proteins. Furthermore, viral Bcl-2 proteins modulate innate immune responses regulated by NF-κB through an interface separate from the canonical BH3-binding groove. Our increasing structural understanding of the viral Bcl-2 proteins is leading to new insights in the cellular Bcl-2 network by exploring potential alternate functional modes in the cellular context.

ESI-MS analysis of RL extracted from appendices treated with salicylic acid, aspirin, and 2,6-DHBA at a micromolar range demonstrated that these compounds are capable of inducing graded conformational changes that are concentration-dependent. A strong correlation between RL conformations and heat-production induced by salicylic acid was also observed.

detect a decrease in the β-sheet content formed in the NAC and
C-terminal regions, while the N-terminal region around the mutation
site presents an increase in β-sheet abundance upon A53T mutation.
This finding indicates that the N-terminal region close to the 53rd
amino acid residue plays an active role in the aggregation mechanism
of the A53T mutant-type αS protein. Furthermore, our newly developed
strategy reveals that the free energy stability of secondary structure
transitions resulting in a helical structure formation is unaffected
by the A53T mutation. However, the preferred residual secondary structure
component transitions to a β-sheet structure shift to the N-terminal
region around the mutation site except at the 53rd amino acid residue
itself, which shows a significant decrease in the stability for transitions
yielding a β-sheet structure. Additionally, transitions from
a coil to a β-sheet structure are the most favorable for the
abundant β-sheet forming residues (see above) of the wild-type
and A53T mutant-type αS proteins in aqueous solution. The intramolecular
interactions occurring in the wild-type and A53T mutant-type αS
protein structures reveal that the long-range interactions between
the NAC region and the N- and C-terminal regions disappear upon A53T
mutation. This result indicates that the NAC region is more solvent
exposed in the A53T mutant-type rather than wild-type αS, which
is related to an increase in the rate of aggregation. In addition
to the overall secondary and tertiary structural characteristics of
the wild-type and A53T mutant-type αS, the PMF surfaces of both
proteins present two favorable conformational basins with different
secondary and tertiary structural properties. However, transitions
of structures between these two basins are predicted to occur more
readily for the A53T rather than the wild-type αS due to the
decreased energy barrier between the basins in the A53T mutant-type
in comparison to the wild-type αS protein. Overall, our results
show that the A53T mutation significantly impacts the structural properties
of the wild-type αS protein. These resulting differences agree
with previous observed experimental measurements and can provide further
insight into the aggregation mechanism of these two proteins. The
details yielded from this study aid in providing the currently missing
fundamental knowledge about the A53T mutant-type αS protein
and the impact of the A53T mutation on the structures of the wild-type αS
protein. The results reported herein can help in the design and synthesis
of more efficient drugs that can block the specific residues forming
certain structures, that is, β-sheet structure, which are reactive

Here, we report the discovery of a novel and highly divergent GBV-B-like virus in an Old World monkey, the black-and-white colobus (Colobus guereza), in Uganda. The new virus, guereza hepacivirus (GHV), clusters phylogenetically with GBV-B and recently described hepaciviruses infecting African bats and North American rodents, and it shows evidence of ancient recombination with these other hepaciviruses. Direct sequencing of reverse-transcribed RNA from blood plasma from three of nine colobus monkeys yielded near-complete GHV genomes, comprising two distinct viral variants. The viruses contain an exceptionally long nonstructural 5A (NS5A) gene, approximately half of which codes for a protein with no discernible homology to known proteins. Computational structure-based analyses indicate that the amino terminus of the GHV NS5A protein may serve a zinc-binding function, similar to the NS5A of other viruses within the family Flaviviridae. However, the 521-amino-acid carboxy terminus is intrinsically disordered, reflecting an unusual degree of structural plasticity and polyfunctionality. These findings shed new light on the natural history and evolution of the hepaciviruses and on the extent of structural variation within the Flaviviridae.",

Proteins completely or partially unstructured in their native (functional) form are involved in key cellular processes underlain by complex networks of protein interactions. The intrinsic conformational flexibility of these disordered proteins allows them to bind multiple partners in transient interactions of high specificity and low affinity. In concordance, in plants this type of proteins has been found in processes requiring these complex and versatile interaction networks. These include transcription factor networks, where disordered proteins act as integrators of different signals or link different transcription factor subnetworks due to their ability to interact (in many cases simultaneously) with different partners. Similarly, they also serve as signal integrators in signaling cascades, such as those related to response to external stimuli. Disordered proteins have also been found in plants in many stress-response processes, acting as protein chaperones or protecting other cellular components and structures. In plants, it is especially important to have complex and versatile networks able to quickly and efficiently respond to changing environmental conditions since these organisms cannot escape and have no other choice than adapting to them. Consequently, protein disorder can play an especially important role in plants, providing them with a fast mechanism to obtain complex, interconnected and versatile molecular networks.",protein function;protein structure;protein interactions;protein intrinsic disorder;biological networks;plant environmental responses

Perhaps as notable is the remarkable number of points of conflict concerning the role of SIRT1 in biological processes. For example, evidence exists suggesting that SIRT1 is a tumor suppressor, is an oncogene, or has no effect on oncogenesis. Similarly, SIRT1 is variably reported to induce, inhibit, or have no effect on autophagy. We believe that the resolution of many conflicting results is possible by considering recent reports indicating that SIRT1 is an important hub interacting with a complex network of proteins that collectively regulate a wide variety of biological processes including cancer and autophagy. A number of the interacting proteins are themselves hubs that, like SIRT1, utilize intrinsically disordered regions for their promiscuous interactions. Many studies investigating SIRT1 function have been carried out on cell lines carrying undetermined numbers of alterations to the proteins comprising the SIRT1 network or on inbred mouse strains carrying fixed mutations affecting some of these proteins. Thus, the effects of modulating SIRT1 amount and/or activity are importantly determined by the genetic background of the cell (or the inbred strain of mice), and the effects attributed to SIRT1 are synthetic with the background of mutations and epigenetic differences between cells and organisms. Work on mice carrying alterations to the Sirt1 gene suggests that the network in which SIRT1 functions plays an important role in mediating physiological adaptation to various sources of chronic stress such as calorie restriction and calorie overload. Whether the catalytic activity of SIRT1 and the nuclear concentration of the co-factor, NAD+, are responsible for modulating this activity remains to be determined. However, the effect of modulating SIRT1 activity must be interpreted in the context of the cell or tissue under investigation. Indeed, for SIRT1, we argue that context is everything.",scale-free network;protein deacetylation;nutritional stress;oncogenesis

DCP2 catalytic activity is stimulated by DCP1, and these proteins form the conserved core of the decapping complex. Additional decapping factors orchestrate the recruitment and activity of this complex in vivo. These factors include enhancer of decapping 3 (EDC3), EDC4, like Sm14A (LSm14A), Pat, the LSm1–7 complex, and the RNA helicase DDX6. Decapping factors are often modular and feature folded domains flanked or connected by low-complexity disordered regions. Recent studies have made important advances in understanding how these disordered regions contribute to the assembly of decapping complexes and promote phase transitions that drive RNP granule formation. These studies have also revealed that the decapping network is governed by interactions mediated by short linear motifs (SLiMs) in these disordered regions. Consequently, the network has rapidly evolved, and although decapping factors are conserved, individual interactions between orthologs have been rewired during evolution. The plasticity of the network facilitates the acquisition of additional subunits or domains in pre-existing subunits, enhances opportunities for regulating mRNA degradation, and eventually leads to the emergence of novel functions.",DCP2;decapping;mRNA decay;SLiMs

Those prion-forming domains are low complexity segments enriched in glutamine/asparagine and depleted in charged residues and prolines. Different predictive methods have been developed to discover novel prions by either assessing the compositional bias of these stretches or estimating the propensity of protein sequences to form amyloid aggregates.

Here, we report the identification of three new mitochondrial LEA proteins in anhydrobiotic embryos of Artemia franciscana, AfrLEA3m_47, AfrLEA3m_43, and AfrLEA3m_29. These new isoforms are recognized by antibody raised against recombinant AfrLEA3m, the original mitochondrial-targeted LEA protein previously reported from these embryos; mass spectrometry confirms all four proteins share sequence similarity. The corresponding messenger RNA (mRNA) species for the four proteins are readily amplified from total complementary DNA (cDNA) prepared from embryos. cDNA sequences of the four mRNAs are quite similar, but each has a stretch of sequence that is absent in at least one of the others, plus multiple single base pair differences. We conclude that all four mitochondrial LEA proteins are products of independent genes. Each possesses a mitochondrial targeting sequence, and indeed Western blots performed on extracts of isolated mitochondria clearly detect all four isoforms. Based on mass spectrometry and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis migration, the cytoplasmic-localized AfrLEA2 exists primarily as a homodimer in A. franciscana. Quantification of protein expression for AfrLEA2, AfrLEA3m, AfrLEA3m_43, and AfrLEA3m_29 as a function of development shows that cellular concentrations are highest in diapause embryos and decrease during development to low levels in desiccation-intolerant nauplius larvae.

","A common single-nucleotide polymorphism in the human brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene results in a Val66Met substitution in the BDNF prodomain region. This single-nucleotide polymorphism is associated with alterations in memory and with enhanced risk to develop depression and anxiety disorders in humans. Here we show that the isolated BDNF prodomain is detected in the hippocampus and that it can be secreted from neurons in an activity-dependent manner. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and circular dichroism we find that the prodomain is intrinsically disordered, and the Val66Met substitution induces structural changes. Surprisingly, application of Met66 (but not Val66) BDNF prodomain induces acute growth cone retraction and a decrease in Rac activity in hippocampal neurons. Expression of p75NTR and differential engagement of the Met66 prodomain to the SorCS2 receptor are required for this effect. These results identify the Met66 prodomain as a new active ligand which modulates neuronal morphology.",

ELPs are hydrophobic polymers that are soluble at low temperatures and cooperatively aggregate above a transition temperature (TT), allowing for thermal targeting of covalently attached drugs. They have been shown to cooperatively transition from a disordered structure to a repeating type II β-turn structure, forming a β-spiral above the TT. Here we present biophysical measurements of the structural, thermodynamic, and hydrodynamic properties of a specific ELP being investigated for drug delivery, ELP[V5G3A2-150]. We examine the biophysical properties below and above the TT to understand and predict the therapeutic potential of ELP-drug conjugates. We observed that below the TT, ELP[V5G3A2-150] is soluble, with an extended conformation consisting of both random coil and heterogeneous β structures. Sedimentation velocity experiments indicate that ELP[V5G3A2-150] undergoes weak self-association with increasing temperature, and above the TT the hydrophobic effect drives aggregation entropically. These experiments also reveal a previously unreported temperature-dependent critical concentration (Cc) that resembles a solubility constant. Labeling ELP[V5G3A2-150] with fluorescein lowers the TT by 3.5°C at 20 μM, whereas ELP[V5G3A2-150] dissolution in physiological media (fetal bovine serum) increases the TT by ∼2.2°C.",

Many of these proteins are implicated in serious illnesses such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Misfolding of amyloidogenic proteins leads to the formation of polymorphic oligomers and fibrils. Oligomeric aggregates are widely thought to be the toxic species, however, fibrils also play a role in membrane damage. We focus on the structure of these aggregates and their interactions with model membranes. Study of interactions of amlyoidogenic proteins with model and natural membranes has shown the importance of the lipid bilayer in protein misfolding and aggregation and has led to the development of several models for membrane permeabilization by the resulting amyloid aggregates. We discuss several of these models: formation of structured pores by misfolded amyloidogenic proteins, extraction of lipids, interactions with receptors in biological membranes, and membrane destabilization by amyloid aggregates perhaps analogous to that caused by antimicrobial peptides.",amyloidogenic proteins;misfolding;amyloid aggregation;fibrillogenesis;membrane permeabilization;amyloid toxicity

Of particular interest is the observation that while chemical denaturation of PR domain results in the formation of a significant amount of polyproline II (PPII) helices, it has little or negligible effect on its overall size as measured by its hydrodynamic radius. Our data also show that the PR domain displays a highly dynamic conformational basin in agreement with the knowledge that the intrinsically unstructured proteins rapidly interconvert between an ensemble of conformations.

After optimization of the quench and proteolysis conditions, more than 1,200 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry, spanning more than 90% of the constituent Aα, Bβ, and γ chain amino acid sequences. The compact central and distal globular regions of fibrinogen were well protected from deuterium exchange, with the exception of the unfolded amino-terminal segments of the Aα and Bβ chains extending from the central region, and the short γ chain “tail” extending from each distal globular region. The triple-helical coiled-coil regions, which bridge the central region to each distal region, were also well protected with the exception of a moderately fast-exchanging area in the middle of each coiled coil adjacent to the γ chain carbohydrate attachment site. These dynamic regions appear to provide flexibility to the fibrinogen molecule. The γ chain “out loop” contained within each coiled-coil also exchanged rapidly. The αC domain (Aα 392–610) exchanged rapidly, with the exception of a short segment sandwiched between a conserved disulfide linkage in the N-terminal αC subdomain. This latter finding is consistent with a mostly disordered structure for the αC domain in native fibrinogen. Analysis of the dysfibrinogen Bβ 235 Pro/Leu, which exhibits abnormal fibrin structure, revealed enhanced deuterium exchange surrounding the Pro/Leu substitution site as well as in the vicinity of the high affinity calcium binding site and the A knob polymerization pocket within the γC domain. The implication of these changes with respect to fibrin structure is discussed.",

The highest protein concentrations are found in the choroid plexus. The primary function of this integral plasma membrane transport protein is to regulate intracellular neuronal pH and also probably to maintain the pH homeostasis across the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. NCBE is predicted to contain at least 10 transmembrane helices. The N- and C- termini are both cytoplasmic, with a large N-terminal domain (Nt-NCBE) and a relatively small C-terminal domain (Ct-NCBE). The Nt-NCBE is likely to be involved in bicarbonate recognition and transport and contains key areas of regulation involving pH sensing and protein-protein interactions. Intrinsic disordered protein regions (IDPRs) are defined as protein regions having no rigid three-dimensional structure under physiological conditions. They are believed to be involved in signaling networks in which specific, low affinity, protein-protein interactions play an important role. We predict that NCBE and other SoLute Carrier 4 (SLC4) family members have a high level of intrinsic disorder in their cytoplasmic regions. To provide biophysical evidence for the IDPRs predicted in Nt-NCBE, we produced pure (>99%), recombinant Nt-NCBE using E. coli as the expression host. The protein was used to perform differential scanning fluorescence spectroscopy (DSF), in order to search for small molecules that would induce secondary or tertiary structure in the IDPRs. We expect this to assist the development of selective pharmaceutical compounds against individual SLC4 family members. We have also determined a low resolution (4 Å) X-ray crystal structure of the N-terminal core domain. The N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (cdb3) of anion exchanger 1 (AE1) shares a similar fold with the N-terminal core domain of NCBE. Crystallization conditions for the full-length N-terminal domain have been sought, but only the core domain yields diffracting crystals.",SLC4;intrinsic disorder;drug screen;NCBE;IDP;bicarbonate

Most proteins rely on conformational flexibility to some degree. Are regions that convey conformational flexibility conserved over evolutionary time? Can changes in conformational flexibility alter protein function? Here, the evolutionary dynamics of structurally ordered and disordered (flexible) regions are investigated genome-wide in flaviviruses, revealing that the amount and location of structural disorder fluctuates highly among related proteins. Some regions are prone to shift between structured and flexible states. Increased evolutionary dynamics of structural disorder is observed for some lineages but not in others. Lineage-specific transitions of this kind could alter the conformational ensemble accessible to the same protein in different species, causing a functional change, even if the predominant function remains conserved. Thus, rapid evolutionary dynamics of structural disorder is a potential driving force for phenotypic divergence among flaviviruses.",conformational flexibility;comparative genomics;structural disorder;flavivirus;divergence

Vitis riparia K2 is a 48-residue protein that can protect lactate dehydrogenase from freeze-thaw damage by preventing the aggregation and denaturation of the enzyme. To further elucidate its mechanism, we used a series of V. riparia K2 concatemers (K4, K6, K8, and K10) and natural dehydrins (V. riparia YSK2, 60 kilodalton peach dehydrin [PCA60], barley dehydrin5 [Dhn5], Thellungiella salsuginea dehydrin2 [TsDHN-2], and Opuntia streptacantha dehydrin1 [OpsDHN-1]) to test the effect of the number of K-segments and dehydrin size on their ability to protect lactate dehydrogenase from freeze-thaw damage. The results show that the larger the hydrodynamic radius of the dehydrin, the more effective the cryoprotection. A similar trend is observed with polyethylene glycol, which would suggest that the protection is simply a nonspecific volume exclusion effect that can be manifested by any protein. However, structured proteins of a similar range of sizes did not show the same pattern and level of cryoprotection. Our results suggest that with respect to enzyme protection, dehydrins function primarily as molecular shields and that their intrinsic disorder is required for them to be an effective cryoprotectant. Lastly, we show that the cryoprotection by a dehydrin is not due to any antifreeze protein-like activity, as has been reported previously.",

Here the focus is on three ubiquitin-independent substrates that have been the subject of detailed study. These are Rpn4, a transcriptional regulator of proteasome homeostasis, thymidylate synthase, an enzyme required for production of DNA precursors and ornithine decarboxylase, the initial enzyme committed to polyamine biosynthesis. It can be inferred from these cases that proteasome association and the presence of an unstructured region are the sole prerequisites for degradation.

Separate x-ray crystallographic and NMR experiments have led to competing explanations, with the former supporting minor conformational changes at the binding site and the latter a major order-to-disorder unfolding transition distant from the binding site. Here, all-atom explicit-solvent molecular dynamics studies employing adaptive biasing force sampling revealed a substantial favorable free-energy change associated with contact formation between the Arg41 side chain and hyaluronan at the binding site, independent of whether the distant site was ordered or disordered. Analogous computational experiments on Arg41Ala mutants showed loss of this favorable free-energy change, consistent with existing experimental data. More provocatively, the simulation data revealed the molecular mechanism by which the order-to-disorder transition enhances hyaluronan binding: in the disordered state, a number of basic residues gain sufficient conformational freedom—lacking in the ordered state—to spontaneously form side-chain contacts with hyaluronan. Mutation of these residues to Ala had been known to decrease binding affinity, but there had previously been no structural explanation, given their lack of proximity to the carbohydrate-binding site in existing structures of the complex.",

Recent results from three separate areas of research with glucocorticoid and other steroid receptors (cofactor-induced changes in receptor structure, the ability of ligands to alter remote regions of receptor structure, and how cofactor concentration affects both ligand potency and efficacy) indicate that a key element of receptor activity is the intrinsically disordered amino-terminal domain.

protein was recently identified in a family of Spanish origin with
hereditary Parkinson’s disease. Detailed understanding of the
structures of the monomeric E46K mutant-type α-synuclein protein
as well as the impact of the E46K missense mutation on the conformations
and free energy landscapes of the wild-type α-synuclein are
required for gaining insights into the pathogenic mechanism of Parkinson’s
disease. In this study, we use extensive parallel tempering molecular
dynamics simulations along with thermodynamic calculations to assess
the secondary and tertiary structural properties as well as the conformational
preferences of the monomeric wild-type and E46K mutant-type α-synuclein
proteins in an aqueous solution environment. We also present the residual
secondary structure component conversion stabilities with dynamics
using a theoretical strategy, which we most recently developed. To
the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first detailed
comparison of the structural and thermodynamic properties of the wild-type
and E46K mutant-type α-synuclein proteins in an aqueous solution
environment at the atomic level with dynamics. We find that the E46K
mutation results not only in local but also in long-range changes
in the structural properties of the wild-type α-synuclein protein.
The mutation site shows a significant decrease in helical content
as well as a large increase in β-sheet structure formation upon
E46K mutation. In addition, the β-sheet content of the C-terminal
region increases significantly in the E46K mutant-type αS in
comparison to the wild-type αS. Our theoretical strategy developed
to assess the thermodynamic preference of secondary structure transitions
indicates that this shift in secondary structure is the result of
a decrease in the thermodynamic preference of turn to helix conversions
while the coil to β-sheet preference increases for these residues.
Long-range intramolecular protein interactions of the C-terminal with
the N-terminal and NAC regions increase upon E46K mutation, resulting
in more compact structures for the E46K mutant-type rather than wild-type
αS. However, the E46K mutant-type αS structures are less
stable than the wild-type αS. Overall, our results show that
the E46K mutant-type αS has a higher propensity to aggregate
than the wild-type αS and that the N-terminal and C-terminal
regions are reactive toward fibrillization and aggregation upon E46K
mutation and we explain the associated reasons based on the structural
properties herein. Small molecules or drugs that can block the specific
residues forming abundant β-sheet structure, which we report
here, might help to reduce the reactivity of these intrinsically disordered
fibrillogenic proteins toward aggregation and their toxicity.",α-synuclein;genetic missense mutation;free energy landsape;molecular dynamics

We show that half of the megasatellites detected encode threonine-rich peptides predicted to be intrinsically disordered, suggesting that they may interact with several partners or serve as flexible linkers. Megasatellite motifs were clustered into several families. Their distribution in fungal genes shows that different motifs are found in orthologous genes and similar motifs are found in unrelated genes, suggesting that megasatellite formation or spreading does not necessarily track the evolution of their host genes.

IAPP, AS and tau are implicated in the pathologies of T2D, PD and AD respectively, and share intriguing commonalities in terms of toxic mechanism, the nucleated kinetics of self-assembly, and the importance of electrostatics and templated self-assembly to the aggregation process. Moreover, they are all examples of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs): in solution, under physiological conditions, they each sample an ensemble of diverse, extended conformations rather than folding into a single, well-defined structure. The highly dynamic and heterogeneous nature of the native states of this class of proteins presents its own set of challenges to biophysical characterization [7, 25, 26]. These three proteins differ in native function and size, spanning a broad range from 37 (IAPP) to 441 (full-length tau) residues, and thus illustrate the versatility of fluorescence approaches applied to important misfolding diseases. We will describe insights into the nature of aggregation-prone states populated in solution, the effects of molecular inducers of aggregation, and the structures of membrane-bound states of these proteins, followed by a discussion of how future advances in fluorescence methods might impact our understanding of aggregation-prone states and early oligomers.",amyloid;intrinsically disordered proteins;misfolding;aggregation;FRET

Furthermore, the presence of a mature chromophore causes hysteresis of protein unfolding and refolding. We survey studies measuring protein unfolding and refolding using traditional methods as well as new approaches, such as mechanical unfolding and reassembly of truncated fluorescent proteins.

Notably, the new domains in AARSs are often found to be structurally disordered or to be linked to the enzyme cores via unstructured linkers. Further bioinformatic analysis performed here classifies the 20 human cytoplasmic AARSs into 3 groups based on their propensities for structural disorder.

FtsZ has an ~50 amino acid (aa) linker between the protofilament-forming globular domain and the C-terminal (Ct) peptide that binds FtsA and ZipA, tethering FtsZ to the membrane. This Ct linker is widely divergent across bacterial species and thought to be an intrinsically disordered peptide (IDP). We confirmed that the Ct linkers from three bacterial species behaved as IDPs in vitro by circular dichroism and trypsin proteolysis. We made chimeras, swapping the Escherichia coli linker for Ct linkers from other bacteria, and even for an unrelated IDP from human α-adducin. Most substitutions allowed for normal cell division, suggesting that sequence of the IDP did not matter. With few exceptions, almost any sequence appears to work. Length, however, was important: IDPs shorter than 43 or longer than 95 aa had compromised or no function. We conclude that the Ct linker functions as a flexible tether between the globular domain of FtsZ in the protofilament, and its attachment to FtsA/ZipA at the membrane. Modeling the Ct linker as a worm-like-chain, we predict that it functions as a stiff entropic spring linking the bending protofilaments to the membrane.",bacterial cell division;tubulin;entropic spring

At the viscosity of water, the kinetics of unimolecular reactions are described by diffusion of a Brownian particle over a free-energy barrier separating reactants and products. For reactions in solution this famous theory extended Eyring's transition state theory, and is widely applied in physics, chemistry, and biology, including reactions as complex as protein folding3,4. Because the diffusion coefficient of Kramers theory is determined by the dynamics in the sparsely-populated region of the barrier top, its properties have not been directly measured for any molecular system. Here we show that the Kramers diffusion coefficient and free energy barrier can be characterized by measuring the temperature- and viscosity-dependence of the transition path time for protein folding. The transition path is the small fraction of an equilibrium trajectory for a single molecule when the free-energy barrier separating two states is actually crossed (Fig. 1a). Its duration, the transition path time, can now be determined from photon trajectories for single protein molecules undergoing folding/unfolding transitions5. Our finding of a long transition path time with an unusually small solvent viscosity-dependence suggests that internal friction as well as solvent friction determine the Kramers diffusion coefficient for α-helical proteins, as opposed to a breakdown of his theory that occurs for many small-molecule reactions2. It is noteworthy that the new and fundamental information concerning Kramers theory and the dynamics of barrier crossings obtained here come from experiments on a protein rather than a much simpler chemical or physical system.",

Structurally, FtsZ consists of four domains: the globular N-terminal core, a flexible linker, 8–9 conserved residues implicated in interactions with modulatory proteins, and a highly variable set of 4–10 residues at its very C terminus. Largely ignored and distinguished by lack of primary sequence conservation, the linker is presumed to be intrinsically disordered. Here we employ genetics, biochemistry and cytology to dissect the role of the linker in FtsZ function. Data from chimeric FtsZs substituting the native linker with sequences from unrelated FtsZs as well as a helical sequence from human beta-catenin indicate that while variations in the primary sequence are well tolerated, an intrinsically disordered linker is essential for B. subtilis FtsZ assembly.

The functional significance of IDRs typically involves gene-regulation processes and is closely related to posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation. We previously reported that the Drosophila facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) protein involved in chromatin remodeling contains an acidic ID fragment (AID) whose phosphorylation modulates FACT binding to nucleosomes. Here, we performed dynamic atomic force microscopy and NMR analyses to clarify how the densely phosphorylated AID masks the DNA binding interface of the high-mobility-group domain (HMG). Dynamic atomic force microscopy of the nearly intact FACT revealed that a small globule temporally appears but quickly vanishes within each mobile tail-like image, corresponding to the HMG-containing IDR. The lifespan of the globule increases upon phosphorylation. NMR analysis indicated that phosphorylation induces no ordered structure but increases the number of binding sites in AID to HMG with an adjacent basic segment, thereby retaining the robust electrostatic intramolecular interaction within FACT even in the presence of DNA. These data lead to the conclusion that the inhibitory effect of nucleosome binding is ascribed to the increase in the probability of encounter between HMG and the phosphorylated IDR.",

Local disorder imparts plasticity to linear motifs. Many molecular recognition of proteins occur between short linear segments, known as LMs. Interaction of short continuous epitopes are not constrained by sequence and have the advantage of resulting in interactions with micromolar affinities which suites transient, reversible complexes such as receptor heteromers. Electrostatic Interactions between epitopes of the GPCR involved, is the Key step in driving heteromer formation forward. The first step in heteromerization, involves phosphorylating the Ser/Thr in an epitope containing a casein kinase 1/2 (CK1/2)-consensus site. Our data suggests that dopaminergic neurotransmission, through cAMP dependent PKA slows down heteromerization. The negative charge, acquired by the phosphorylation of a Ser/Thr in a PKA consensus site in the Arg rich epitope, affects the activity of the receptors involved in heteromerization by causing allosteric conformational changes, due to the repulsive effect generated by the negatively charged phosphate. In addition to modulating heteromerization, it affects the stability of the heteromers’ interactions and their binding affinity. So here we have an instance where phosphorylation is not just an on/off switch, instead by weakening the noncovalent bond, heteromerization acts like a rheostat that controls the stability of the heteromer through activation or inhibition of adenylate cyclase by the neurotransmitter Dopamine depending on which Dopamine receptor it docks at.",Dopamine Receptors;Adenosine Receptor;Receptor heteromers;Noncovalent Interactions;Disordered Proteins;phosphorylation

Enhanced recognition of protein biochemistry as well as the need to have more targeted approaches to treat cancer has rendered transcription factors approachable for therapeutic development. Since transcription factors lack enzymatic domains, the specific targeting of these proteins has unique challenges. One challenge is the hydrophobic microenvironment that affects small molecules gaining access to block protein interactions. The most attractive transcription factors to target are those formed from tumor specific chromosomal translocations that are validated oncogenic driver proteins. EWS-FLI1 is a fusion protein that results from the pathognomonic translocation of Ewing sarcoma (ES). Our past work created the small molecule YK-4-279 that blocks EWS-FLI1 from interacting with RNA Helicase A (RHA). To fulfill long-standing promise in the field by creating a clinically useful drug, steps are required to allow for in vivo administration. These investigations identify the need for continuous presence of the small molecule protein-protein inhibitor for a period of days. We describe the pharmacokinetics of YK-4-279 and its individual enantiomers. In vivo studies confirm prior in vitro experiments showing (S)-YK-4-279 as the EWS-FLI1 specific enantiomer demonstrating both induction of apoptosis and reduction of EWS-FLI1 regulated caveolin-1 protein. We have created the first rat xenograft model of ES, treated with (S)-YK-4-279 dosing based upon PK modeling leading to a sustained complete response in 2 of 6 ES tumors. Combining laboratory studies, pharmacokinetic measurements, and modeling has allowed us to create a paradigm that can be optimized for in vivo systems using both in vitro data and pharmacokinetic simulations. Thus, (S)-YK-4-279 as a small molecule drug is ready for continued development towards a first-in-human, first-in-class, clinical trial.",YK-4-279;EWS-FLI1;Ewing Sarcoma;rat xenograft;pharmacokinetic modeling

To date, model proteins selected for folding studies represent only a small fraction of the complexity of the proteome and are unlikely to exhibit the breadth of folding mechanisms used in vivo. We are in urgent need of new methods – both theoretical and experimental – that can quantify the folding behavior of a truly broad set of proteins under in vivo conditions.

In cells under stress, translocation of PAGE4 to mitochondria increases while production of reactive oxygen species decreases. Furthermore, PAGE4 is also upregulated in human fetal prostate, underscoring its potential role in development. However, the proteins that interact with PAGE4 and the mechanisms underlying its pleiotropic functions in prostatic development and disease remain unknown. Here, we identified c-Jun as a PAGE4 interacting partner. We show that both PAGE4 and c-Jun are overexpressed in the human fetal prostate; and in cell-based assays, PAGE4 robustly potentiates c-Jun transactivation. Single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer experiments indicate that upon binding to c-Jun, PAGE4 undergoes conformational changes. However, no interaction is observed in presence of BSA or unilamellar vesicles containing the mitochondrial inner membrane diphosphatidylglycerol lipid marker cardiolipin. Together, our data indicate that PAGE4 specifically interacts with c-Jun and that, conformational dynamics may account for its observed pleiotropic functions. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating crosstalk between a CTA and a proto-oncogene.

First, we propose a novel method for estimating thermodynamic stability of proteins whose sequence is constrained to a fixed composition. Second, we quantify the average deleterious impact of substituting one amino acid with another. Natural proteome compositions are special in at least two ways: 1) Natural compositions do not generate more stable proteins than the average random composition, however, they result in proteins that are less susceptible to damage from mutations. 2) Natural proteome compositions that result in more stable proteins (i.e. those of thermophiles) are also tuned to have a higher tolerance for mutations. This is consistent with the observation that environmental factors selecting for more stable proteins also enhance the deleterious impact of mutations.",

In particular, back-calculated chemical shifts provide a sensitive probe of the populations of residual secondary structure elements and helix capping interactions, while spin-relaxation calculations are sensitive to a combination of dynamic and structural factors. Back calculated chemical shift and spin-relaxation data can be used to evaluate the populations of specific interactions in disordered states and identify regions of the phase space that are inconsistent with experimental measurements. The structural interactions that favor and disfavor helical conformations in the disordered basic region of the GCN4 bZip domain were analyzed in order to assess the implications of the structure and dynamics of the apo form for the DNA binding mechanism. The structural couplings observed in these experimentally validated simulations are consistent with a mechanism where the binding of a preformed helical interface would induce folding in the remainder of the protein, supporting a hybrid conformational selection / induced folding binding mechanism.",

To systematically probe where these slow dynamic fluctuations occur, we now present data from smFRET studies wherein FRET labels were placed at ARs 1 and 4 (mutant named AR 1–4), at ARs 2 and 5 (AR 2–5), and at ARs 3 and 6 (AR 3–6). The results presented here reveal that AR 6 most readily detaches/unfolds from the AR domain, undergoing substantial fluctuations at room temperature. AR 6 has fewer stabilizing consensus residues than the other IκBα ARs, probably contributing to the ease with which AR 6 “loses grip”. AR 5 shows almost no fluctuations at room temperature, but a significant fraction of molecules shows fluctuations at 37 °C. Introduction of stabilizing mutations that are known to fold AR 6 dampen the fluctuations of AR 5, indicating that the AR 5 fluctuations are likely due to weakened inter-repeat stabilization from AR 6. AR 1 also fluctuates somewhat at room temperature, suggesting that fluctuations are a general behavior of ARs at ends of AR domains. Remarkably, AR 1 still fluctuates in the bound state, but mainly between 0.6 and 0.9 FRET efficiency, whereas in the free IκBα, the fluctuations extend to <0.5 FRET efficiency.

Template based homology modeling techniques have matured to a point where they are now routinely used to complement experimental techniques. With the scientific focus of interest moving towards larger macromolecular complexes and dynamic networks of interactions, the integration of computational modeling methods with low-resolution experimental techniques allows studying large and complex molecular machines. Computational modeling and prediction techniques are still facing a number of challenges which hamper the more widespread use by the non-expert scientist. For example, it is often difficult to convey the underlying assumptions of a computational technique, as well as the expected accuracy and structural variability of a specific model.

The C-terminal domain carries the lethal activity and the central domain is required for surface receptor binding. The N-terminal domain, required for translocation across the outer membrane, is always intrinsically unstructured. It has always been assumed therefore that the C-terminal cytotoxic domain is required for the bactericidal activity. Here we report the unexpected finding that in isolation, the 90-residue unstructured N-terminal domain of colicin N is cytotoxic. Furthermore it causes ion leakage from cells but, unlike known antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with this property, shows no membrane binding behaviour. Finally, its activity remains strictly dependent upon the same receptor proteins (OmpF and TolA) used by full-length colicin N. This mechanism of rapid membrane disruption, via receptor mediated binding of a soluble peptide, may reveal a new target for the development of highly specific antibacterials.",

We stimulated yeast strains to overexpress each single gene product to approximately 1% of the total protein content. Consistent with previous reports, we found that excessive expression of proteins containing disordered or membrane-protruding regions resulted in an especially high fitness cost. We estimated these costs to be nearly twice as high as for other proteins. There was a ten-fold difference in cost if, instead of entire proteins, only the disordered or membrane-embedded regions were compared with other segments. Although the cost of processing bulk protein was measurable, it could not be explained by several tested protein features, including those linked to translational efficiency or intensity of physical interactions after maturation. It most likely included a number of individually indiscernible effects arising during protein synthesis, maturation, maintenance, (mal)functioning, and disposal. When scaled to the levels normally achieved by proteins in the cell, the fitness cost of dealing with one amino acid in a standard protein appears to be generally very low. Many single amino acid additions or deletions are likely to be neutral even if the effective population size is as large as that of the budding yeast. This should also apply to substitutions. Selection is much more likely to operate if point mutations affect protein structure by, for example, extending or creating stretches that tend to unfold or interact improperly with membranes.",molecular evolution rate;protein overexpression;membrane proteins;disordered proteins;budding yeast

In recent years NMR methods have also been developed to study protein folding as it might occur within the cell, in a de novo manner, by observing the folding of nascent polypeptides in the process of emerging from the ribosome during synthesis. Despite the 2.3 MDa molecular weight of the bacterial 70S ribosome, many nascent polypeptides, and some ribosomal proteins, have sufficient local flexibility that sharp resonances may be observed in solution-state NMR spectra. In providing information on dynamic regions of the structure, NMR spectroscopy is therefore highly complementary to alternative methods such as X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, which have successfully characterized the rigid core of the ribosome particle. However, the low working concentrations and limited sample stability associated with ribosome–nascent chain complexes means that such studies still present significant technical challenges to the NMR spectroscopist. This review will discuss the progress that has been made in this area, surveying all NMR studies that have been published to date, and with a particular focus on strategies for improving experimental sensitivity.",Nuclear magnetic resonance;Protein folding;Co-translational;Ribosome;Sensitivity

This article is divided into four sections that mirror the main approaches used in the field to better understand oligomers: (1) attempts to locate and examine oligomers in vivo in situ; that is, without removing these species from their environment; (2) studies involving oligomers extracted from human or animal tissues and the subsequent characterization of their properties ex vivo; (3) studies of oligomers that have been produced synthetically and studied using a reductionist approach in relatively simple in vitro biophysical systems; and (4) computational studies of oligomers in silico.

Genetic and biochemical evidence reveals that they are integral to the termination of transcription of short non-coding RNAs by RNA polymerase II. Here we define a Nab3 mutation (nab3Δ134) that removes an essential part of the protein's C terminus but nevertheless can rescue, in trans, the phenotype resulting from a mutation in the RNA recognition motif of Nab3. This low complexity region of Nab3 appears intrinsically unstructured and can form a hydrogel in vitro. These data support a model in which multiple Nrd1-Nab3 heterodimers polymerize onto substrate RNA to effect termination, allowing complementation of one mutant Nab3 molecule by another lacking a different function. The self-association property of Nab3 adds to the previously documented interactions between these hnRNP-like proteins, RNA polymerase II, and the nascent transcript, leading to a network of nucleoprotein interactions that define a higher order Nrd1-Nab3 complex. This was underscored from the synthetic phenotypes of yeast strains with pairwise combinations of Nrd1 and Nab3 mutations known to affect their distinct biochemical activities. The mutations included a Nab3 self-association defect, a Nab3-Nrd1 heterodimerization defect, a Nrd1-polymerase II binding defect, and an Nab3-RNA recognition motif mutation. Although no single mutation was lethal, cells with any two mutations were not viable for four such pairings, and a fifth displayed a synthetic growth defect.

Although its large, double-stranded DNA genome has been completely characterized, most putative protein functions remain obscure. To provide more informative knowledge about this virus, a proteomic-scale network of WSSV-WSSV protein interactions was carried out using a comprehensive yeast two-hybrid analysis. An array of yeast transformants containing each WSSV open reading frame fused with GAL4 DNA binding domain and GAL4 activation domain was constructed yielding 187 bait and 182 prey constructs, respectively. On screening of ∼28,000 pairwise combinations, 710 interactions were obtained from 143 baits. An independent coimmunoprecipitation assay (co-IP) was performed to validate the selected protein interaction pairs identified from the yeast two-hybrid approach. The program Cytoscape was employed to create a WSSV protein–protein interaction (PPI) network. The topology of the WSSV PPI network was based on the Barabási-Albert model and consisted of a scale-free network that resembled other established viral protein interaction networks. Using the RNA interference approach, knocking down either of two candidate hub proteins gave shrimp more protection against WSSV than knocking down a nonhub gene. The WSSV protein interaction map established in this study provides novel guidance for further studies on shrimp viral pathogenesis, host-viral protein interaction and potential targets for therapeutic and preventative antiviral strategies in shrimp aquaculture.",

Despite its central importance, little is known about SUFU regulation and the nature of SUFU–GLI interaction. Here, the crystal and small-angle X-ray scattering structures of full-length human SUFU and its complex with the key SYGHL motif conserved in all GLIs are reported.

Electronic mail: ude.usm.htam@iew","The emerging complexity of large macromolecules has led to challenges in their full scale theoretical description and computer simulation. Multiscale multiphysics and multidomain models have been introduced to reduce the number of degrees of freedom while maintaining modeling accuracy and achieving computational efficiency. A total energy functional is constructed to put energies for polar and nonpolar solvation, chemical potential, fluid flow, molecular mechanics, and elastic dynamics on an equal footing. The variational principle is utilized to derive coupled governing equations for the above mentioned multiphysical descriptions. Among these governing equations is the Poisson-Boltzmann equation which describes continuum electrostatics with atomic charges. The present work introduces the theory of continuum elasticity with atomic rigidity (CEWAR). The essence of CEWAR is to formulate the shear modulus as a continuous function of atomic rigidity. As a result, the dynamics complexity of a macromolecular system is separated from its static complexity so that the more time-consuming dynamics is handled with continuum elasticity theory, while the less time-consuming static analysis is pursued with atomic approaches. We propose a simple method, flexibility-rigidity index (FRI), to analyze macromolecular flexibility and rigidity in atomic detail. The construction of FRI relies on the fundamental assumption that protein functions, such as flexibility, rigidity, and energy, are entirely determined by the structure of the protein and its environment, although the structure is in turn determined by all the interactions. As such, the FRI measures the topological connectivity of protein atoms or residues and characterizes the geometric compactness of the protein structure. As a consequence, the FRI does not resort to the interaction Hamiltonian and bypasses matrix diagonalization, which underpins most other flexibility analysis methods. FRI's computational complexity is of 𝒪(N2) at most, where N is the number of atoms or residues, in contrast to 𝒪(N3) for Hamiltonian based methods. We demonstrate that the proposed FRI gives rise to accurate prediction of protein B-Factor for a set of 263 proteins. We show that a parameter free FRI is able to achieve about 95% accuracy of the parameter optimized FRI. An interpolation algorithm is developed to construct continuous atomic flexibility functions for visualization and use with CEWAR.",

Network description and analysis not only gives a systems-level understanding of drug action and disease complexity, but can also help to improve the efficiency of drug design. We give a comprehensive assessment of the analytical tools of network topology and dynamics. The state-of-the-art use of chemical similarity, protein structure, protein-protein interaction, signaling, genetic interaction and metabolic networks in the discovery of drug targets is summarized. We propose that network targeting follows two basic strategies. The “central hit strategy” selectively targets central node/edges of the flexible networks of infectious agents or cancer cells to kill them. The “network influence strategy” works against other diseases, where an efficient reconfiguration of rigid networks needs to be achieved. It is shown how network techniques can help in the identification of single-target, edgetic, multi-target and allo-network drug target candidates. We review the recent boom in network methods helping hit identification, lead selection optimizing drug efficacy, as well as minimizing side-effects and drug toxicity.

Among the seven mammalian Sirtuins, Sirt1 is the physiologically best-studied isoform. It regulates nuclear functions such as chromatin remodelling and gene transcription, and it appears to mediate beneficial effects of a low calorie diet which can partly be mimicked by the Sirt1 activating polyphenol resveratrol. The molecular details of Sirt1 domain architecture and regulation, however, are little understood. It has a unique N-terminal domain and CTD (C-terminal domain) flanking a conserved Sirtuin catalytic core and these extensions are assumed to mediate Sirt1-specific features such as homo-oligomerization and activation by resveratrol. To analyse the architecture of human Sirt1 and functions of its N- and C-terminal extensions, we recombinantly produced Sirt1 and Sirt1 deletion constructs as well as the AROS (active regulator of Sirt1) protein. We then studied Sirt1 features such as molecular size, secondary structure and stimulation by small molecules and AROS. We find that Sirt1 is monomeric and has extended conformations in its flanking domains, likely disordered especially in the N-terminus, resulting in an increased hydrodynamic radius. Nevertheless, both termini increase Sirt1 deacetylase activity, indicating a regulatory function. We also find an unusual but defined conformation for AROS protein, which fails, however, to stimulate Sirt1. Resveratrol, in contrast, activates the Sirt1 catalytic core independent of the terminal domains, indicating a binding site within the catalytic core and suggesting that small molecule activators for other isoforms might also exist.",activation;AROS;oligomerization;resveratrol;Sirtuin;structure

Tau isoforms include a microtubule-binding domain containing either three or four imperfect tandem microtubule binding repeats that also form the core of tau filaments and contain hexapaptide motifs that are critical for tau aggregation. The tau microtubule-binding domain can also engage in direct interactions with detergents, fatty acids, or membranes, which can greatly facilitate tau aggregation and may also mediate some tau functions. Here, we show that the alternatively spliced second microtubule-binding repeat exhibits significantly different structural characteristics compared with the other three repeats in the context of the intact repeat domain. Most notably, the PHF6* hexapeptide motif located at the N-terminus of repeat 2 has a lower propensity to form strand-like structure than the corresponding PHF6 motif in repeat 3, and unlike PHF6 converts to partially helical structure in the micelle-bound state. Interestingly, the behavior of the Module-B motif, located at the beginning of repeat 4, resembles that of PHF6* rather than PHF6. Our observations, combined with previous results showing that PHF6* and Module-B are both less effective than PHF6 in nucleating tau aggregation, suggest a hierarchy in the efficacy of these motifs in nucleating tau aggregation that originates in differences in their intrinsic propensities for extended strand-like structure and the resistance of these propensities to changes in tau's environment.",tau;Alzheimer's;amyloid;microtubule-binding repeat;microtubule-binding domain;protein aggregation;paired helical filaments;PHF6;PHF6*

Here we probe the general potential of the cell to encode information about proteins in the average characteristics of their cognate mRNAs and decode it in a ribosome-independent manner. We show that average protein hydrophobicity, calculated from either sequences or 3D structures, can be encoded in an analogue fashion by many different average mRNA sequence properties with the only constraint being that pyrimidine and purine bases be clearly distinguishable on average. Moreover, average characteristics of mRNA sequences enable discrimination between cytosolic and membrane proteins even in the absence of topogenic signal-based mechanisms. Our results suggest that protein and mRNA localization may be partly determined by basic physicochemical rationales and interdependencies between the two biomolecules.",

The crowded milieu results in excluded-volume effects, increased bulk viscosity and amplified chances for inter-molecular interactions. These environmental factors have not been accounted for in most mechanistic studies of protein folding executed during the last decades. The question thus arises as to how these effects—present when polypeptides normally fold in vivo—modulate protein biophysics. To address excluded volume effects, we use synthetic macromolecular crowding agents, which take up significant volume but do not interact with proteins, in combination with strategically selected proteins and a range of equilibrium and time-resolved biophysical (spectroscopic and computational) methods. In this review, we describe key observations on macromolecular crowding effects on protein stability, folding and structure drawn from combined in vitro and in silico studies. As expected based on Minton’s early predictions, many proteins (apoflavodoxin, VlsE, cytochrome c, and S16) became more thermodynamically stable (magnitude depends inversely on protein stability in buffer) and, unexpectedly, for apoflavodoxin and VlsE, the folded states changed both secondary structure content and, for VlsE, overall shape in the presence of macromolecular crowding. For apoflavodoxin and cytochrome c, which have complex kinetic folding mechanisms, excluded volume effects made the folding energy landscapes smoother (i.e., less misfolding and/or kinetic heterogeneity) than in buffer.",Protein folding;Macromolecular crowding;Spectroscopy;Protein stability;Excluded volume;Coarse-grained simulation

The primary consideration in this work is the intermediate group of proteins that are overall well folded, but which contain small regions that undergo order/disorder transitions. In particular, the current focus is on those order/disorder transitions that are energetically coupled to ligand binding. As exemplified by the case of human liver pyruvate kinase (hL-PYK), peptides that mimic the sequence of the order/disorder region can be used as allosteric regulators of the enzyme. Based on this example and others reported in the literature, we propose that a similar use of peptides that mimic protein regions that experience ligand-dependent order-disorder transitions can be a generalized initiation point for the development of allosteric drugs.",

H2O2 application, and thus it is expected to represent a prototypic multimodal
TRP channel. TRPGz possesses a cytosolic C-terminal domain (CTD), primarily composed of
intrinsically disordered regions with some regulatory modules, a putative coiled-coil region and a
basic residue cluster. The CTD oligomerization mediated by the coiled-coil region is required for
the hyperosmotic and temperature increase activations but not for the tetrameric channel formation
or other activation modalities. In contrast, the basic cluster is responsible for general channel
inhibition, by binding to phosphatidylinositol phosphates. The crystal structure of the presumed
coiled-coil region revealed a tetrameric assembly in an offset spiral rather than a canonical
coiled-coil. This structure underlies the observed moderate oligomerization affinity enabling the
dynamic assembly and disassembly of the CTD during channel functions, which are compatible with the

Here we use a topology-based Gō-like model to delineate the relationship between dimer interface formation and monomer folding and to better understand the structural details of the chaperone activation mechanism. Free energy surfaces show that dimer interface formation and monomer folding proceed concurrently through an on-pathway dimeric intermediate in which one monomer is partially unfolded. The absence of a preexisting fully folded monomer in the proposed binding mechanism is in agreement with HdeA’s rapid chaperone response. Binding between unfolded monomers exhibits an enhancement of molecular recognition reminiscent of the fly-casting mechanism.

Like other members of the lamin family, goldfish lamin B3 (gfLB3) contains two putative consensus phosphoacceptor p34cdc2 sites (Ser-28 and Ser-398) for the M-phase kinase to regulate lamin polymerization on the N- and C-terminal regions flanking a central rod domain. Partial phosphorylation of gfLB3 occurs on Ser-28 in the N-terminal head domain in immature oocytes prior to germinal vesicle breakdown, which suggests continual rearrangement of lamins by a novel lamin kinase in fish oocytes. We applied the expression-screening method to isolate lamin kinases by using phosphorylation site Ser-28-specific monoclonal antibody and a vector encoding substrate peptides from a goldfish ovarian cDNA library. As a result, SRPK1 was screened as a prominent lamin kinase candidate. The gfLB3 has a short stretch of the RS repeats (9-SRASTVRSSRRS-20) upstream of the Ser-28, within the N-terminal head. This stretch of repeats is conserved among fish lamin B3 but is not found in other lamins. In vitro phosphorylation studies and GST-pull down assay revealed that SRPK1 bound to the region of sequential RS repeats (9–20) with affinity and recruited serine into the active site by a grab-and-pull manner.

Yet we still lack full understanding of the contributions of aromatic-aromatic interactions to protein stability and the timing of their formation during folding. Here, using as a case study an aromatic ladder in the β-barrel protein, cellular retinoic acid binding protein 1 (CRABP1), we find aromatic π stacking plays a greater role in the Phe65-Phe71 cross-strand pair while in another pair, Phe50-Phe65, hydrophobic interactions are dominant. The Phe65/Phe71 pair spans β-strands 4 and 5 in the β-barrel, which lack interstrand hydrogen bonding, and we speculate that it compensates energetically for the absence of strand-strand backbone interactions. Using perturbation analysis, we find that both aromatic-aromatic pairs form after the transition state for folding of CRABP1, thus playing a role in the final stabilization of the β-sheet rather than in its nucleation as had been earlier proposed. The aromatic interaction between strands 4–5 in CRABP1 is highly conserved in the intracellular lipid-binding protein (iLBP) family, and several lines of evidence combine to support a model wherein it acts to maintain barrel structure while allowing the dynamic opening that is necessary for ligand entry. Lastly, we carried out a bioinformatic analysis and found 51 examples of aromatic-aromatic interactions across non-hydrogen-bonded β-strands outside the iLBPs, arguing for the generality of the role played by this structural motif.",aromatic-aromatic interactions;β-barrel;folding;dynamics;hydrogen bond;π stacking

Previous studies have shown that intracellular degradation of the human enzyme [hTS (human thymidylate synthase)] is mediated by the 26S proteasome, and occurs in a ubiquitin-independent manner. Degradation of hTS is governed by a degron that is located at the polypeptide's N-terminus that is capable of promoting the destabilization of heterologous proteins to which it is attached. The hTS degron is bipartite, consisting of two subdomains: an IDR (intrinsically disordered region) that is highly divergent among mammalian species, followed by a conserved amphipathic α-helix (designated hA). In the present report, we have characterized the structure and function of the hTS degron in more detail. We have conducted a bioinformatic analysis of interspecies sequence variation exhibited by the IDR, and find that its hypervariability is not due to diversifying (or positive) selection; rather, it has been subjected to purifying (or negative) selection, although the intensity of such selection is relaxed or weakened compared with that exerted on the rest of the molecule. In addition, we have verified that both subdomains of the hTS degron are required for full activity. Furthermore, their co-operation does not necessitate that they are juxtaposed, but is maintained when they are physically separated. Finally, we have identified a ‘cryptic’ degron at the C-terminus of hTS, which is activated by the N-terminal degron and appears to function only under certain circumstances; its role in TS metabolism is not known.",proteasome;relaxed purifying selection;thymidylate synthase;ubiquitin-independent

However, the precise mechanism(s) and the specific residues involved in mediating the functional effects of the M-domain are not fully understood. Positively charged residues adjacent to phosphorylation sites in the M-domain are thought to be critical for effects of cMyBP-C on cross-bridge interactions by mediating electrostatic binding with myosin S2 and/or actin. However, recent structural studies revealed that highly conserved sequences downstream of the phosphorylation sites form a compact tri-helix bundle. Here we used site-directed mutagenesis to probe the functional significance of charged residues adjacent to the phosphorylation sites and conserved residues within the tri-helix bundle. Results confirm that charged residues adjacent to phosphorylation sites and residues within the tri-helix bundle are important for mediating effects of the M-domain on contraction. In addition, four missense variants within the tri-helix bundle that are associated with human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy caused either loss-of-function or gain-of-function effects on force. Importantly, the effects of the gain-of-function variant, L348P, increased the affinity of the M-domain for actin. Together, results demonstrate that functional effects of the M-domain are not due solely to interactions with charged residues near phosphorylatable serines and provide the first demonstration that the tri-helix bundle contributes to the functional effects of the M-domain, most likely by binding to actin.",Cardiac Hypertrophy;Cardiac Muscle;Cardiomyopathy;Contractile Protein;Protein Phosphorylation;Myosin-binding Protein C;Tri-helix Bundle

For nucleic acids, however, despite the availability of semi-empirical methods for predicting 1H chemical shifts, their use in determining the structure and dynamics has not yet been examined. Here, we show that 1H chemical shifts offer powerful restraints for RNA structure determination, allowing discrimination of native structure from non-native states to within 2–4 Å, and <3 Å when ignoring highly flexible residues. Theoretical simulations shows that while 1H chemical shifts can provide valuable information for constructing RNA dynamic ensembles, large uncertainties in the chemical shift predictions and inherent degeneracies lead to higher uncertainties as compared to residual dipolar couplings.",

+1-307-766-3181","Despite high sequence identity among mammalian prion proteins, mammals
have varying rates of susceptibility to prion disease resulting in a so-called
species barrier. The species barrier follows no clear pattern, with closely
related species or similar sequences being no more likely to infect each other,
and remains an unresolved enigma. Variation of the conformationally flexible
regions may alter the thermodynamics of the conformational change, commonly
referred to as the conformational conversion, that occurs in the pathogenic
process of the mammalian prion protein. A conformational ensemble scenario is
supported by the species barrier in prion disease and evidence that there are
strains of pathogenic prion with different conformations within species. To
study how conformational flexibility has evolved in the prion protein, an
investigation was undertaken of the evolutionary dynamics of structurally
disordered regions in the mammalian prion protein, non-mammalian prion protein
that is not vulnerable to prion disease, and remote homologs Doppel and Shadoo.
Structural disorder prediction analyzed in an evolutionary context revealed that
the occurrence of increased or altered conformational flexibility in mammalian
prion proteins coincides with key events among PrP, Doppel, and Shadoo.
Comparatively rapid evolutionary dynamics of conformational flexibility in the
prion protein suggest that the species barrier is not a static phenomenon. A
small number of amino acid substitutions can repopulate the conformational
ensemble and have a disproportionately large effect on pathogenesis.",protein evolution;conformational ensemble;structural disorder;evolution;gene duplication;misfolding

Computational methods to accurately predict protein structure from the sequence have primarily been evaluated on protein sequences representing full-length native proteins. Here, we demonstrate that top-performing structure prediction methods can accurately predict the partial structures of proteins encoded by sequences that contain approximately 50% or more of the full-length protein sequence. We hypothesize that structure prediction may be useful for predicting functions of proteins whose corresponding genes are mapped expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that encode partial-length amino acid sequences. Additionally, we identify a confidence score representing the quality of a predicted structure as a useful means of predicting the likelihood that an arbitrary polypeptide sequence represents a portion of a foldable protein sequence (“foldability”).

The diverse functions of Bag6 are supported by its ubiquitous localization to the cytoplasm, the nucleus, and membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in cells. In ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways, Bag6 can interact with the membrane-associated ubiquitin ligase gp78 via its ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, but the relative low affinity of this interaction does not reconcile with the fact that a fraction of Bag6 is tightly bound to the membranes. Here, we demonstrate that the UBL domain of Bag6 is required for interaction with the ER membranes. We find that in addition to gp78, the Bag6 UBL domain also binds a UBL-binding motif in UbxD8, an essential component of the gp78 ubiquitinating machinery. Importantly, Bag6 contains a proline-rich (PR) domain termed PDP (Proline rich-DUF3587-Proline rich) that forms homo-oligomer, allowing the UBL domain to form multivalent interactions with gp78 and UbxD8, which are essential for recruitment of Bag6 to the ER membrane. Furthermore, the PR domain comprises largely intrinsically disordered segments, which are sufficient for interaction with an unfolded substrate. We propose that simultaneous association with multiple ERAD factors helps to anchor a disordered chaperone oligomer to the site of retrotranslocation to prevent protein aggregation in ERAD.",E3 Ubiquitin Ligase;Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress;Endoplasmic Reticulum(ER);ER-associated Degradation;Molecular Chaperone;Bag6/Bat3/Scythe;gp78;Holdase;Retrotranslocation

Overexpression of hFXN56–210 in Escherichia coli yields a multimer, whereas the mature form of hFXN (hFXN81–210) is monomeric. Thus, cumulative experimental evidence points to the N-terminal moiety as an essential element for the assembly of a high molecular weight oligomer. The secondary structure propensity of peptide 56–81, the moiety putatively responsible for promoting protein–protein interactions, was also studied. Depending on the environment (TFE or SDS), this peptide adopts α-helical or β-strand structure. In this context, we explored the conformation and stability of hFXN56–210. The biophysical characterization by fluorescence, CD and SEC-FPLC shows that subunits are well folded, sharing similar stability to hFXN90–210. However, controlled proteolysis indicates that the N-terminal stretch is labile in the context of the multimer, whereas the FXN domain (residues 81–210) remains strongly resistant. In addition, guanidine hydrochloride at low concentration disrupts intermolecular interactions, shifting the ensemble toward the monomeric form. The conformational plasticity of the N-terminal tail might impart on hFXN the ability to act as a recognition signal as well as an oligomerization trigger. Understanding the fine-tuning of these activities and their resulting balance will bear direct relevance for ultimately comprehending hFXN function.",Frataxin;Helical propensity;Protein stability;Oligomerization;Folding

Here it is reported that a KS-type dehydrin can reduce the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from Cu. AtHIRD11, which is the Arabidopsis KS-type dehydrin, inhibited generation of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals in the Cu–ascorbate system. The radical-reducing activity of AtHIRD11 was stronger than those of radical-silencing peptides such as glutathione and serum albumin. The addition of Cu2+ reduced the disordered state, decreased the trypsin susceptibility, and promoted the self-association of AtHIRD11. Domain analyses indicated that the five domains containing histidine showed ROS-reducing activities. Histidine/alanine substitutions indicated that histidine is a crucial residue for reducing ROS generation. Using the 27 peptides which are related to the KnS-type dehydrins of 14 plant species, it was found that the strengths of ROS-reducing activities can be determined by two factors, namely the histidine contents and the length of the peptides.

The catalytic A chain then crosses the endosome or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to reach its cytosolic target. Dissociation of the A chain from the cell-binding B chain occurs before or during translocation to the cytosol, and only the A chain enters the cytosol. In some cases, AB subunit dissociation is facilitated by the unique physiology and function of the ER. The A chains of these ER-translocating toxins are stable within the architecture of the AB holotoxin, but toxin disassembly results in spontaneous or assisted unfolding of the isolated A chain. This unfolding event places the A chain in a translocation-competent conformation that promotes its export to the cytosol through the quality control mechanism of ER-associated degradation. A lack of lysine residues for ubiquitin conjugation protects the exported A chain from degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and an interaction with host factors allows the cytosolic toxin to regain a folded, active state. The intrinsic instability of the toxin A chain thus influences multiple steps of the intoxication process.

In this work, we started the analysis with a widely known formulation of an objective for the problem of superimposing a set of multiple molecules as variance minimization over an ensemble. A negative effect of this superpositioning method is the introduction of ambiguous rotations, where different rotation matrices may be applied to structurally similar molecules. We developed two algorithms to resolve the suboptimal rotations. The first approach minimizes the variance together with the distance of a structure to a preceding molecule in the ensemble. The second algorithm seeks for minimal variance together with the distance to the nearest neighbors of each structure. The newly developed methods were applied to molecular-dynamics trajectories and normal-mode ensembles of the Aβ peptide, RS peptide, and lysozyme. These new (to our knowledge) superpositioning methods combine the benefits of variance and distance between nearest-neighbor(s) minimization, providing a solution for the analysis of intrinsic motions of flexible molecules and resolving ambiguous rotations.",

Steady-state levels of a proteome depend on transcription, the levels of transcripts, translation and protein degradation but system-level contribution that each of these processes make to the final protein expression change has yet to be explored. We therefore applied a systems biology approach to characterize the regulation of protein expression during cellular differentiation using quantitative proteomics. As a general rule, it seems that protein expression during cellular differentiation is largely controlled by changes in the relative synthesis rate, whereas the relative degradation rate of the majority of proteins stays constant. In these data, we also observe that the proteins in defined sub-structures of larger protein complexes tend to have highly correlated synthesis and degradation rates but that this does not necessarily extend to the holo-complex. Finally, we provide strong evidence that the generally poor correlation observed between transcript and protein levels can fully be explained once the protein synthesis and degradation rates are taken into account.",differentiation;macromolecular complexes;protein turnover;proteomics;systems biology

Binding to lipid membranes is considered key to the still poorly understood function of α-synuclein. We report the effects of N-terminal acetylation on α-synuclein binding to lipid vesicles of different composition and curvature and to micelles composed of the detergents β-octyl-glucoside (BOG) and SDS. In the presence of SDS, N-terminal acetylation results in a slightly increased helicity for the N-terminal ∼10 residues of the protein, likely due to the stabilization of N-terminal fraying through the formation of a helix cap motif. In the presence of BOG, a detergent used in previous isolations of helical oligomeric forms of α-synuclein, the N-terminally acetylated protein adopts a novel conformation in which the N-terminal ∼30 residues bind the detergent micelle in a partly helical conformation, whereas the remainder of the protein remains unbound and disordered. Binding of α-synuclein to lipid vesicles with high negative charge content is essentially unaffected by N-terminal acetylation irrespective of curvature, but binding to vesicles of lower negative charge content is increased, with stronger binding observed for vesicles with higher curvature. Thus, the naturally occurring N-terminally acetylated form of α-synuclein exhibits stabilized helicity at its N terminus and increased affinity for lipid vesicles similar to synaptic vesicles, a binding target of the protein in vivo. Furthermore, the novel BOG-bound state of N-terminally acetylated α-synuclein may serve as a model of partly helical membrane-bound intermediates with a role in α-synuclein function and dysfunction.",α-Synuclein;Lipid-binding Protein;Parkinson Disease;Post Translational Modification;Protein Aggregation;Synuclein;N-terminal Acetylation

The p53 transactivation domain (p53TAD) contains two conserved ΦXXΦΦ motifs (Φ indicates a bulky hydrophobic residue and X is any other residue) referred to as p53TAD1 (residues 15–29) and p53TAD2 (residues 39–57). We previously showed that p53TAD1 can act as a binding motif for anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. In this study, we have identified p53TAD2 as a binding motif for anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins by using NMR spectroscopy, and we calculated the structures of Bcl-XL/Bcl-2 in complex with the p53TAD2 peptide. NMR chemical shift perturbation data showed that p53TAD2 peptide binds to diverse members of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family independently of p53TAD1, and the binding between p53TAD2 and p53TAD1 to Bcl-XL is competitive. Refined structural models of the Bcl-XL·p53TAD2 and Bcl-2·p53TAD2 complexes showed that the binding sites occupied by p53TAD2 in Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 overlap well with those occupied by pro-apoptotic BH3 peptides. Taken together with the mutagenesis, isothermal titration calorimetry, and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement data, our structural comparisons provided the structural basis of p53TAD2-mediated interaction with the anti-apoptotic proteins, revealing that Bcl-XL/Bcl-2, MDM2, and cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein/p300 share highly similar modes of binding to the dual p53TAD motifs, p53TAD1 and p53TAD2. In conclusion, our results suggest that the dual-site interaction of p53TAD is a highly conserved mechanism underlying target protein binding in the transcription-dependent and transcription-independent apoptotic pathways of p53.",Apoptosis;Bcl-2 Family Proteins;Mitochondrial Apoptosis;NMR;p53;Protein Complexes;Protein Structure;Protein/Protein Interactions;Dual-site Interaction

Schizosaccharomyces pombe Cwf10 (homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Snu114 and human U5-116K), an integral member of the U5 snRNP, is a GTPase that has multiple roles within the splicing cycle. Cwf10/Snu114 family members are highly homologous to eukaryotic translation elongation factor EF2, and they contain a conserved N-terminal extension (NTE) to the EF2-like portion, predicted to be an intrinsically unfolded domain. Using S. pombe as a model system, we show that the NTE is not essential, but cells lacking this domain are defective in pre-mRNA splicing. Genetic interactions between cwf10-ΔNTE and other pre-mRNA splicing mutants are consistent with a role for the NTE in spliceosome activation and second-step catalysis. Characterization of Cwf10-NTE by various biophysical techniques shows that in solution the NTE contains regions of both structure and disorder. The first 23 highly conserved amino acids of the NTE are essential for its role in splicing but when overexpressed are not sufficient to restore pre-mRNA splicing to wild-type levels in cwf10-ΔNTE cells. When the entire NTE is overexpressed in the cwf10-ΔNTE background, it can complement the truncated Cwf10 protein in trans, and it immunoprecipitates a complex similar in composition to the late-stage U5.U2/U6 spliceosome. These data show that the structurally flexible NTE is capable of independently incorporating into the spliceosome and improving splicing function, possibly indicating a role for the NTE in stabilizing conformational rearrangements during a splice cycle.",

S100B is the best studied member and has been shown to interact with over 20 binding partners in a calcium-dependent manner. The TRTK12 peptide, derived from the consensus binding sequence for S100B, has previously been found to interact with S100A1 and has been proposed to be a general binding partner of the S100 family. To test this hypothesis and gain a better understanding of the specificity of binding for the S100 proteins sixteen members of the human S100 family were screened against this peptide and its alanine variants. Novel interactions were only found with two family members: S100P and S100A2, indicating that TRTK12 selectively interacts with a small subset of the S100 proteins. Substantial promiscuity was observed in the binding site of S100B to accommodate variations in the peptide sequence, while S100A1, S100A2, and S100P exhibited larger differences in the binding constants for the TRTK12 alanine variants. This suggests that single-point substitutions can be used to selectively modulate the affinity of TRTK12 peptides for individual S100 proteins. This study has important implications for the rational drug design of inhibitors for the S100 proteins, which are involved in a variety of cancers and neurodegenerative diseases.",

The interaction between p53 and MDM2 is essential for the maintenance of genomic integrity for most eukaryotes. Previous structural studies revealed that MDM2 binds to p53 transactivation domain (p53TAD) from residues 17 to 29. The K24N mutation of p53TAD changes a lysine at position 24 to an asparagine. This mutation occurs naturally in the bovine family and is also found in a rare form of human gestational cancer called choriocarcinoma. In this study we have investigated how the K24N mutation affects the affinity, structure, and dynamics of p53TAD binding to MDM2. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies of p53TAD show the K24N mutant is more flexible and has less transient helical secondary structure than the wildtype. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements demonstrate that these changes in structure and dynamics do not significantly change the binding affinity for p53TAD-MDM2. Finally, free energy perturbation and standard molecular dynamics simulations suggest the negligible affinity change is due to a compensating interaction energy between the K24N mutant and MDM2 when it is bound. Overall, the data suggests that the K24N-MDM2 complex is able to at least partly compensate for an increase in the conformational entropy in unbound K24N with an increase in the bound state electrostatic interaction energy.",intrinsically disordered protein;binding mechanism;nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy;isothermal titration calorimetry;molecular dynamics

Remarkably, the substrate promiscuity of AGMEs is quite variable. The molecular basis for such ligand promiscuity is largely unknown as there is not an obvious link between amino acid sequence or structure and the antibiotic profiles of AGMEs. To address this issue, this article presents the first kinetic and thermodynamic characterization of one of the least promiscuous AGMEs, the AG N3 acetyltransferase-IIa (AAC-IIa) and its comparison to two highly promiscuous AGMEs, the AG N3-acetyltransferase-IIIb (AAC-IIIb) and the AG phosphotransferase(3′)-IIIa (APH). Despite having similar antibiotic selectivities, AAC-IIIb and APH catalyze different reactions and share no homology to one another. AAC-IIa and AAC-IIIb catalyze the same reaction and are very similar in both amino acid sequence and structure. However, they demonstrate strong differences in their substrate profiles and kinetic and thermodynamic properties. AAC-IIa and APH are also polar opposites in terms of ligand promiscuity but share no sequence or apparent structural homology. However, they both are highly dynamic and may even contain disordered segments and both adopt well-defined conformations when AGs are bound. Contrary to this AAC-IIIb maintains a well-defined structure even in apo form. Data presented herein suggest that the antibiotic promiscuity of AGMEs may be determined neither by the flexibility of the protein nor the size of the active site cavity alone but strongly modulated or controlled by the effects of the cosubstrate on the dynamic and thermodynamic properties of the enzyme.",aminoglycosides;acetyltransferase;protein dynamics;ligand promiscuity;isothermal titration calorimetry;nuclear magnetic resonance;aminoglycoside modification;antibiotic resistance;intrinsically disordered proteins

We identify problem families using protein regions that match two or more Pfam families not currently annotated as related in Pfam. We find that HMMER3 E-value estimates seem to be less accurate for families that feature periodic patterns of compositional bias, such as the ones typically observed in coiled-coils. These results support the continued use of manually curated inclusion thresholds in the Pfam database, especially on the subset of families that have been identified as problematic in experiments such as these. They also highlight the need for developing new methods that can correct for this particular type of compositional bias.",

Here we show that polymeric fibers formed from these LC domains directly bind the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II in a manner reversible by phosphorylation of the iterated, heptad repeats of the CTD. Mutational analysis indicates that the degree of binding between the CTD and the LC domain polymers correlates with the strength of transcriptional activation.

The majority of the core protein (CP149) comprises the capsid assembly domain, and the C-terminal region (residues 150–183) is responsible for nucleic acid binding. Protein monomers associate to form dimeric structural subunits, and helices 3 and 4 (residues 50–111 of the assembly domain) have been shown to be important for this as they constitute the interdimer interface. Here, using mass spectrometry coupled with ion mobility spectrometry, we demonstrate the conformational flexibility of the CP149 dimer. Limited proteolysis was used to locate involvement in this feature to the C-terminal region. A genetically fused CP dimer was found to show decreased disorder, consistent with a more restricted C-terminus at the fusion junction. Incubation of CP149 dimer with heteroaryldihydropyrimidine-1, a small molecule known to interfere with the assembly process, was shown to result in oligomers different in shape to the capsid assembly-competent oligomers of the fused CP dimer. We suggest that heteroaryldihydropyrimidine-1 affects the dynamics of CP149 dimer in solution, likely affecting the ratio between assembly active and inactive states. Therefore, assembly of the less dynamic fused dimer is less readily misdirected by heteroaryldihydropyrimidine-1. These studies of the flexibility and oligomerization properties of hepatitis B virus core protein illustrate both the importance of C-terminal dynamics in function and the utility of gas-phase techniques for structural and dynamical biomolecular analysis.",

In vitro studies have determined that in addition to its specific methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) MeCP2 also has several chromatin association domains. However, the specific interactions of MeCP2 with methylated or non-methylated chromatin regions and the structural characteristics of the resulting DNA associations in vivo remain poorly understood. We analysed the role of the MBD in MeCP2–chromatin associations in vivo using an MeCP2 mutant Rett syndrome mouse model (Mecp2tm1.1Jae) in which exon 3 deletion results in an N-terminal truncation of the protein, including most of the MBD. Our results show that in mutant mice, the truncated form of MeCP2 (ΔMeCP2) is expressed in different regions of the brain and liver, albeit at 50% of its wild-type (wt) counterpart. In contrast to the punctate nuclear distribution characteristic of wt MeCP2, ΔMeCP2 exhibits both diffuse nuclear localization and a substantial retention in the cytoplasm, suggesting a dysfunction of nuclear transport. In mutant brain tissue, neuronal nuclei are smaller, and ΔMeCP2 chromatin is digested faster by nucleases, producing a characteristic nuclease-resistant dinucleosome. Although a fraction of ΔMeCP2 is found associated with nucleosomes, its interaction with chromatin is transient and weak. Thus, our results unequivocally demonstrate that in vivo the MBD of MeCP2 together with its adjacent region in the N-terminal domain are critical for the proper interaction of the protein with chromatin, which cannot be replaced by any other of its protein domains.",

The amphipathic α-helix is the structural motif that enables apoA-I to achieve this functionality. In the lipid-free state, the helical segments unfold and refold in seconds and are located in the N-terminal two thirds of the molecule where they are loosely packed as a dynamic, four-helix bundle. The C-terminal third of the protein forms an intrinsically disordered domain that mediates initial binding to phospholipid surfaces, which occurs with coupled α-helix formation. The lipid affinity of apoA-I confers detergent-like properties; it can solubilize vesicular phospholipids to create discoidal HDL particles with diameters of approximately 10 nm. Such particles contain a segment of phospholipid bilayer and are stabilized by two apoA-I molecules that are arranged in an anti-parallel, double-belt conformation around the edge of the disc, shielding the hydrophobic phospholipid acyl chains from exposure to water. The apoA-I molecules are in a highly dynamic state, and they stabilize discoidal particles of different sizes by certain segments forming loops that detach reversibly from the particle surface. The flexible apoA-I molecule adapts to the surface of spherical HDL particles by bending and forming a stabilizing trefoil scaffold structure. The above characteristics of apoA-I enable it to partner with ABCA1 in mediating efflux of cellular phospholipid and cholesterol and formation of a heterogeneous population of nascent HDL particles. Novel insights into the structure-function relationships of apoA-I should help reveal mechanisms by which HDL subclass distribution can be manipulated.",ATP binding cassette transporter A1;amphipathic α-helix;apoA-I;apoE;cholesterol;helix bundle;lipoprotein;membrane solubilization;phospholipid

These proteins possess self-templating and transmissible characteristics. The crowded physiological environments where the aggregation of these amyloidogenic proteins takes place can be imitated in vitro by the addition of macromolecular crowding agents such as inert polysaccharides. In this review, we summarize the aggregation of prion proteins in crowded physiological environments and discuss the role of macromolecular crowding in prion protein aggregation. We also summarize the aggregation of prion- like proteins including human Tau protein, human α-synuclein, and human copper, zinc superoxide dismutase under macromolecular crowding environments and discuss the role of macromolecular crowding in prion- like protein aggregation. The excluded-volume effects caused by macromolecular crowding could accelerate the aggregation of neurodegenerative disease-associated proteins while inhibiting the aggregation of the proteins that are not neurodegenerative disease-associated.",prion protein;Tau protein;prion- like protein;protein aggregation;macromolecular crowding;neurodegenerative diseases

We use hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry to characterize H2A-H2B and Nap1. Unexpectedly, we find that at low ionic strength the α-helices in H2A-H2B are frequently sampling partially disordered conformations, and that binding to Nap1 reduces this conformational sampling. We identify the interaction surface between H2A-H2B and Nap1, and confirm its relevance both in vitro and in vivo. We show that two copies of H2A-H2B bound to a Nap1 homodimer form a tetramer with contacts between H2B chains similar to those in the four-helix bundle structural motif. The organization of the complex reveals that Nap1 competes with histone-DNA and inter-histone interactions observed in the nucleosome, thereby regulating the availability of histones for chromatin assembly.",

The binding affinity, defined as the strength of these interactions, is translated into physico-chemical terms in the dissociation constant (Kd), the latter being an experimental measure that determines whether an interaction will be formed in solution or not. Predicting binding affinity from structural models has been a matter of active research for more than 40 years because of its fundamental role in drug development. However, all available approaches are incapable of predicting the binding affinity of protein–protein complexes from coordinates alone. Here, we examine both theoretical and experimental limitations that complicate the derivation of structure–affinity relationships. Most work so far has concentrated on binary interactions. Systems of increased complexity are far from being understood. The main physico-chemical measure that relates to binding affinity is the buried surface area, but it does not hold for flexible complexes. For the latter, there must be a significant entropic contribution that will have to be approximated in the future. We foresee that any theoretical modelling of these interactions will have to follow an integrative approach considering the biology, chemistry and physics that underlie protein–protein recognition.",dissociation constant;protein interaction models;protein complex modelling;protein–protein docking;scoring functions;structure–affinity relations

The transition between native α-helices and nonnative intermolecular β-sheets has been suggested to be a trigger of fibrillation in different conformational diseases. The FF domain of the URN1 splicing factor (URN1-FF) is a small all-α protein that populates a molten globule (MG) at low pH. Despite the fact that this conformation maintains most of the domain native secondary structure, it progressively converts into β-sheet enriched and highly ordered amyloid fibrils. In this study, we investigated if 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) induced conformational changes that affect URN1-FF amyloid formation. Despite TFE having been shown to induce or increase the aggregation of both globular and disordered proteins at moderate concentrations, we demonstrate here that in the case of URN1-FF it reinforces its intrinsic α-helical structure, which competes the formation of aggregated assemblies. In addition, we show that TFE induces conformational diversity in URN1-FF fibrils, in such a way that the fibrils formed in the presence and absence of the cosolvent represent different polymorphs. It is suggested that the effect of TFE on both the soluble and aggregated states of URN1-FF depends on its ability to facilitate hydrogen bonding.",α-helix;amyloid;FF domain;trifluoroethanol;molten globule

Nm/Ng and their respective IQ peptides are intrinsically unstructured; however, upon binding with CaM, IQ motifs adopt a helical conformation. Ser41 (Ser36) of Nm (Ng) is located in a negatively charged pocket in the apo CaM and, when phosphorylated, it will repel Nm/Ng from CaM.

The precise site(s) within N that mediates the N-P interaction and the detailed regulating mechanism, however, are less clear. Using a human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) minigenome assay, we found that an N mutant (NL478A) did not support reporter gene expression. Using in vivo and in vitro coimmunoprecipitation, we found that NL478A maintains the ability to form NL478A0-P, to self-assemble, and to form NL478A-RNA but that NL478A-RNA does not interact with P. Using an immunofluorescence assay, we found that N-P interaction provides the minimal requirement for the formation of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, which contain viral RNA, N, P, and polymerase in HPIV3-infected cells. NL478A was unable to form inclusion bodies when coexpressed with P, but the presence of N rescued the ability of NL478A to form inclusion bodies and the transcriptional function of NL478A, thereby suggesting that hetero-oligomers formed by N and NL478A are functional and competent to form inclusion bodies. Furthermore, we found that NL478A is also defective in virus growth. To our knowledge, we are the first to use a paramyxovirus to identify a precise amino acid within N that is critical for N-RNA and P interaction but not for N0-P interaction for the formation of inclusion bodies, which appear to be bona fide sites of RNA synthesis.",

These repeats are overrepresented in certain protein families such as kinases, transcription factors, RNA helicases, and spliceosome components, leading to the suggestion that the expansion of low-complexity regions may be under positive selection [6]. In the case of P. falciparum, the repeats are present in about 30% of the proteome and are primarily composed of asparagine residues [7]. The average size of such low-complexity regions is about 37 residues [8]. The asparagine-rich, low-complexity regions in P. falciparum are found in all protein families in all developmental stages; they are underrepresented in heat shock proteins and surface antigens [7].

of the wild-type and R5A mutant-type Aβ42 peptides were performed.
The NMR structure (PDBID 1Z0Q) of the wild-type Aβ42 peptide was used as the
initial geometry,52 and the R5A mutant-type
structure was made by replacing the R residue with an A residue in
the initial wild-type Aβ42 structure. The Amber11 software package37 utilizing the Amber ff99SB potential functions200 for proteins was used to perform the REMD simulations.
The Onufriev–Bashford–Case implicit solvent model was
chosen to represent the solution environment around the protein in
order to avoid possible confined aqueous volume effects and specific
heat errors on the simulated structures.5,6,39,40 Particle mesh Ewald
method was used to treat the long-range interactions using a cutoff
value of 25 Å.41,42 The temperature was maintained
by employing Langevin dynamics with a collision frequency of 2 ps–1.41 Each REMD simulation
utilized 24 different replicas with temperatures exponentially distributed
between 280 and 400 K, as shown in our previous studies of the Aβ
peptide.5,6,43 The integration
time step was set to 2 fs with trajectories saved every 500 steps.
The initial conformations of both peptides were equilibrated for 200
ps at each replica temperature. Then, both peptide structures were
simulated for 300 ns per replica (for each peptide) with exchanges
between replicas attempted every 5 ps, yielding a total simulation
time of 7.2 μs and an exchange probability of 0.74 for both
the wild-type and R5A mutant-type Aβ42 peptides. The convergence
of both simulations occurred at 150 ns as determined via time-dependent
secondary structure component abundance and the conformational internal
energy values (see Supporting Information). All calculations of the structural and thermodynamic properties
of both Aβ42 peptides were performed on the 150 000 structures
obtained after convergence for each peptide from the replica closest
to physiological temperature (∼310 K). The conformational stabilities
of the wild-type and R5A mutant-type Aβ42 peptides were calculated
utilizing the molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA)

Human TH is regulated, among other mechanisms, by Ser19-phosphorylation-dependent interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. The N-terminal sequence (residues 1-43), which corresponds to an extension to the TH regulatory domain, also interacts with negatively charged membranes. By using X-ray crystallography together with molecular dynamics simulations and structural bioinformatics analysis, we have probed the conformations of the Ser19-phosphorylated N-terminal peptide (THp-(1-43)), bound to 14-3-3γ, free in solution and bound to a phospholipid bilayer, and of the unphosphorylated peptide TH-(1-43) both free and bilayer-bound. As seen in the crystal structure of THp-(1-43) complexed with 14-3-3γ, the region surrounding pSer19 adopts an extended conformation in the bound state, whereas THp-(1-43) adopts a bent conformation when free in solution, with higher content of secondary structure and higher number of internal hydrogen bonds. TH-(1-43) in solution presents the highest mobility and least defined structure of all forms studied, and it shows an energetically more favorable interaction with membranes relative to THp-(1-43). Cationic residues, notably Arg15 and Arg16, which are the recognition sites of the kinases phosphorylating at Ser19, are also contributing to the interaction with the membrane. Our results reveal the structural flexibility of this region of TH, in accordance with the functional versatility and conformational adaptation to different partners. Furthermore, this structural information has potential relevance for the development of therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders, through modulation of TH-partner interactions.",

It has a unique 9-fold symmetry and its assembly is governed by at least five component proteins (SPD-2, ZYG-1, SAS-5, SAS-6 and SAS-4), which are recruited in a hierarchical order. Recently published structural studies of the SAS-6 N-terminal domain have greatly advanced our understanding of the mechanisms of centriole assembly. However, it remains unclear how the weak interaction between the SAS-6 N-terminal head groups could drive the assembly of a closed ring-like structure, and what determines the stacking of multiple rings on top one another in centriole duplication. We recently reported that SAS-5 binds specifically to a very narrow region of the SAS-6 central coiled coil through its C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 391–404). Here, we further demonstrate by both static light scattering and small angle X-ray scattering that the SAS-5 N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 1–260) forms a tetramer. Specifically, we found that the tetramer is formed by SAS-5 residues 82–260, whereas residues 1–81 are intrinsically disordered.

We previously used atomic force microscopy to investigate the mechanical properties of murine cMyBP-C expressed using a baculovirus/insect cell expression system. Here, we investigate whether the mechanical properties of cMyBP-C are conserved across species by using atomic force microscopy to manipulate recombinant human cMyBP-C and native cMyBP-C purified from bovine heart. Force versus extension data obtained in velocity-clamp experiments showed that the mechanical response of the human recombinant protein was remarkably similar to that of the bovine native cMyBP-C. Ig/Fn-like domain unfolding events occurred in a hierarchical fashion across a threefold range of forces starting at relatively low forces of ∼50 pN and ending with the unfolding of the highest stability domains at ∼180 pN. Force-extension traces were also frequently marked by the appearance of anomalous force drops suggestive of additional mechanical complexity such as structural coupling among domains. Both recombinant and native cMyBP-C exhibited a prominent segment ∼100 nm-long that could be stretched by forces <50 pN before the unfolding of Ig- and FN-like domains. Combined with our previous observations of mouse cMyBP-C, these results establish that although the response of cMyBP-C to mechanical load displays a complex pattern, it is highly conserved across species.",

The soluble form is structurally related to the glutathione-S-transferase family, and CLIC can covalently bind glutathione via an active site cysteine. We report approximately 0.6 μs of molecular dynamics simulations, encompassing the three possible ligand-bound states of CLIC1, using the structure of GSH-bound human CLIC1. Noncovalently bound GSH was rapidly released from the protein, whereas the covalently ligand-bound protein remained close to the starting structure over 0.25 μs of simulation. In the unliganded state, conformational changes in the vicinity of the glutathione-binding site resulted in reduced reactivity of the active site thiol. Elastic network analysis indicated that the changes in the unliganded state are intrinsic to the protein architecture and likely represent functional transitions. Overall, our results are consistent with a model of CLIC function in which covalent binding of glutathione does not occur spontaneously but requires interaction with another protein to stabilise the GSH binding site and/or transfer of the ligand. The results do not indicate how CLIC1 undergoes a radical conformational change to form a transmembrane chloride channel but further elucidate the mechanism by which CLICs are redox controlled.",

We have recently reported a structure-activity relationship study of one such small molecule, 10074-G5, and generated an analog, JY-3-094, with significantly improved ability to prevent or disrupt the association between recombinant Myc and Max proteins. However, JY-3094 penetrates cells poorly. Here, we show that esterification of a critical para-carboxylic acid function of JY-3-094 by various blocking groups significantly improves cellular uptake although it impairs the ability to disrupt Myc-Max association in vitro. These pro-drugs are highly concentrated within cells where JY-3-094 is then generated by the action of esterases. However, the pro-drugs are also variably susceptible to extracellular esterases, which can deplete extracellular reservoirs. Furthermore, while JY-3-094 is retained by cells for long periods of time, much of it is compartmentalized within the cytoplasm in a form that appears to be less available to interact with Myc. Our results suggest that persistently high extracellular levels of pro-drug, without excessive susceptibility to extracellular esterases, are critical to establishing and maintaining intracellular levels of JY-3-094 that are sufficient to provide for long-term inhibition of Myc-Max association.

As a consequence of excluded volume effects, compact folded states of proteins should be indirectly stabilized due to destabilization of extended unfolded conformations. Here, we assess the role of excluded volume in terms of protein stability, structural dimensions and folding dynamics using a sugar-based crowding agent, dextran 20, and the small ribosomal protein S16 as a model system. To specifically address dimensions, we labeled the protein with BODIPY at two positions and measured Trp-BODIPY distances under different conditions. As expected, we found that dextran 20 (200 mg/ml) stabilized the variants against urea-induced unfolding. At conditions where the protein is unfolded, Förster resonance energy transfer measurements reveal that in the presence of dextran, the unfolded ensemble is more compact and there is residual structure left as probed by far-ultraviolet circular dichroism. In the presence of a crowding agent, folding rates are faster in the two-state regime, and at low denaturant concentrations, a kinetic intermediate is favored. Our study provides direct evidence for protein unfolded-state compaction in the presence of macromolecular crowding along with its energetic and kinetic consequences.",

Aft1 and Kluyveromyces lactis KlAft are orthologous yeast transcription activators that regulate the expression of the same group of iron-uptake genes but bind to the different DNA sites: TGCACCC for Aft1 and PuCACCC for KlAft. To establish whether the DNA-binding mechanisms of Aft1 and KlAft have diverged during the evolution of the Aft-type transcription factor, we examined the function of a nonconserved region in their DNA-binding domains. A large part of this region is composed of a sequence predicted to be disordered in structure and potentially phosphorylated. We show with deletion mutant analyses that this sequence is essential for the binding of Aft1 to its DNA site and for the iron uptake and growth of S. cerevisiae under iron-limited conditions. We constructed hybrid proteins by exchanging the nonconserved regions of Aft1 and KlAft. We show that the Aft1 region is necessary and sufficient for KlAft to bind efficiently to the Aft1 DNA site in S. cerevisiae and to complement the iron-dependent phenotype of the aft1Δaft2Δ mutant. This demonstrates that the changes in the nonconserved region of the Aft-type DNA-binding domain have led to changes in the DNA-binding specificity and have major consequences for the regulation of iron homeostasis. The combination of bioinformatic and experimental analyses indicates that the sequence TGCACCC is the most probable ancestral Aft-type element. Our findings suggest that the changes in the nonconserved region of the DNA-binding domain are responsible for the evolution of the TGCACCC sequence toward PuCACCC in the K. lactis species.",iron homeostasis;Saccharomyces cerevisiae;Kluyveromyces lactis;Aft-type regulator;electrophoretic mobility shift assays

However, the success rate of computational design remains low. In this review, we provide an overview of experimentally validated, de novo designed proteins and compare four available programs, RosettaDesign, EGAD, Liang-Grishin, and RosettaDesign-SR, by assessing designed sequences computationally. Computational assessment includes the recovery of native sequences, the calculation of sizes of hydrophobic patches and total solvent-accessible surface area, and the prediction of structural properties such as intrinsic disorder, secondary structures, and three-dimensional structures. This computational assessment, together with a recent community-wide experiment in assessing scoring functions for interface design, suggests that the next-generation protein-design scoring function will come from the right balance of complementary interaction terms. Such balance may be found when more negative experimental data become available as part of a training set.",computational assessment of designed sequences;secondary structure;solvent accessibility;hydrophobic patch;intrinsic disorder

Approximately 150 base pairs of DNA wraps around an octamer of core histones to form the nucleosome, the basic unit of chromatin. Linker histones compact chromatin further by binding to and neutralizing the charge of the DNA between nucleosomes. It is well established that chromatin packing is regulated by a complex pattern of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) to core histones, but linker histone function is less well understood. In this review, we describe the current understanding of the many roles that linker histones play in cellular processes, including gene regulation, cell division, and development, while putting the linker histone in the context of other nuclear proteins. Although intriguing roles for plant linker histones are beginning to emerge, much of our current understanding comes from work in animal systems.

The answer to this question has important implications for our understanding of why many small proteins fold with two state kinetics. When the equilibration within the unfolded state U is much faster than the folding, the folding kinetics will be two state even if there are many folding pathways with different barriers. Yet the mean first passage times (MFPTs) between different regions of the unfolded state can be much longer than the folding time. This seems to imply that the equilibration within U is much slower than the folding. In this communication we resolve this paradox. We present a formula for estimating the time to equilibrate the unfolded state of a protein. We also present a formula for the MFPT to any state within U, which is proportional to the average lifetime of that state divided by the state population. This relation is valid when the equilibration within U is very fast as compared with folding as it often is for small proteins. To illustrate the concepts, we apply the formulas to estimate the time to equilibrate the unfolded state of Trp-cage and MFPTs within the unfolded state based on a Markov State Model using an ultra-long 208 microsecond trajectory of the miniprotein to parameterize the model. The time to equilibrate the unfolded state of Trp-cage is ∼100 ns while the typical MFPTs within U are tens of microseconds or longer.",protein unfolded state;protein folding;mean first passage time;Markov state model

Conversely, factors regulating chromatin and transcription complexes impact the splicing process. This extensive cross-talk between gene regulatory layers takes advantage of dynamic spatial, physical and temporal organizational properties of the cell nucleus, and further emphasizes the importance of developing a multidimensional understanding of splicing control.",

A possible mechanism is the ability of mutant p53 proteins to physically interact with other proteins, including members of the same family, namely p63 and p73, inactivating their function. Assuming that this interaction might occurs at the level of the monomer, to investigate the molecular basis for this interaction, here, we sample the structural flexibility of the wild-type p53 monomeric protein. The results show a strong stability up to 850 ns in the DNA binding domain, with major flexibility in the N-terminal transactivations domains (TAD1 and TAD2) as well as in the C-terminal region (tetramerization domain). Several stable hydrogen bonds have been detected between N-terminal or C-terminal and DNA binding domain, and also between N-terminal and C-terminal. Essential dynamics analysis highlights strongly correlated movements involving TAD1 and the proline-rich region in the N-terminal domain, the tetramerization region in the C-terminal domain; Lys120 in the DNA binding region.

By the mid 1990s yeast and human homologues to bacterial MutL and MutS had been identified and their contribution to hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC; Lynch Syndrome) was under intense investigation. The human MutS homologue 6 protein (hMSH6), was first reported in 1995 as a G:T binding partner (GTBP) of hMSH2, forming the hMutSα mismatch-binding complex. Signal transduction from each DNA-bound hMutSα complex is accomplished by the hMutLα heterodimer (hMLH1 and hPMS2). Molecular mechanisms and cellular regulation of individual MMR proteins are now areas of intensive research. This review will focus on molecular mechanisms associated with mismatch binding, as well as emerging evidence that MutSα and in particular, MSH6, is a key protein in MMR-dependent DNA damage response and communication with other DNA repair pathways within the cell. MSH6 is unstable in the absence of MSH2, however it is the DNA lesion-binding partner of this heterodimer. MSH6, but not MSH2, has a conserved Phe-X-Glu motif that recognizes and binds several different DNA structural distortions, initiating different cellular responses. hMSH6 also contains the nuclear localization sequences required to shuttle hMutSα into the nucleus. For example, upon binding to O6meG:T, MSH6 triggers a DNA damage response that involves altered phosphorylation within the N-terminal disordered domain of this unique protein. While many investigations have focused on MMR as a post-replication DNA repair mechanism, MMR proteins are expressed and active in all phases of the cell cycle. There is much more to be discovered about regulatory cellular roles that require the presence of MutSα and, in particular, MSH6.",DNA mismatch repair;MSH2;MSH6;DNA damage signaling;N-terminal disordered domain

The structure and function of OSs depends on a precise stacking of hundreds of membranous disks. Each disk is fully (as in rods) or partially (as in cones) bounded by a rim, at which the membrane is distorted into an energetically unfavorable high-curvature bend; however, the mechanism(s) underlying disk rim structure is (are) not established. Here, we demonstrate that the intrinsically disordered cytoplasmic C-terminus of the photoreceptor tetraspanin peripherin-2/rds (P/rds) can directly generate membrane curvature. A P/rds C-terminal domain and a peptide mimetic of an amphipathic helix contained within it each generated curvature in liposomes with a composition similar to that of OS disks and in liposomes generated from native OS lipids. Association of the C-terminal domain with liposomes required conical phospholipids, and was promoted by membrane curvature and anionic surface charge, results suggesting that the P/rds C-terminal amphipathic helix can partition into the cytosolic membrane leaflet to generate curvature by a hydrophobic insertion (wedging) mechanism. This activity was evidenced in full-length P/rds by its induction of small-diameter tubulovesicular membrane foci in cultured cells. In sum, the findings suggest that curvature generation by the P/rds C-terminus contributes to the distinctive structure of OS disk rims, and provide insight into how inherited defects in P/rds can disrupt organelle structure to cause retinal disease. They also raise the possibility that tethered amphipathic helices can function for shaping cellular membranes more generally.",Amphipathic helix;Membrane curvature;Photoreceptor;Retinal degeneration;Tetraspanin;Intrinsically disordered

Most notable are the stretching experiments performed by atomic force microscopes and laser tweezers. Here we present an alternative single molecule method that can unfold a protein domain, observed at electric fields greater than 106 V/m, and is fully controllable by the application of increasing voltages across the membrane of the pore. Furthermore this unfolding mechanism is characterized by measuring both the residence time of the protein within the nanopore and the current blockade. The unfolding data supports a gradual unfolding mechanism rather than the cooperative transition observed by classical urea denaturation experiments. Lastly it is shown that the voltage-mediated unfolding is a function of the stability of the protein by comparing two mutationally destabilized variants of the protein.",

Function of ω is known to be substituted by GroEL in ω-null strain, which thus does not exhibit a discernable phenotype. In this work, we report isolation of ω variants whose expression in vivo leads to a dominant lethal phenotype. Studies show that in contrast to ω, which is largely unstructured, ω mutants display substantial acquisition of secondary structure. By detailed study with one of the mutants, ω6 bearing N60D substitution, the mechanism of lethality has been deciphered. Biochemical analysis reveals that ω6 binds to β′ subunit in vitro with greater affinity than that of ω. The reconstituted RNAP holoenzyme in the presence of ω6
in vitro is defective in transcription initiation. Formation of a faulty RNAP in the presence of mutant ω results in death of the cell.

Despite the success of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in the therapy of CML, TKI-resistance remains an unsolved problem in the clinic. We have recently shown that Gab2 signalling counteracts the efficacy of four distinct Bcr-Abl inhibitors. In the course of that project, we noticed that two clinically relevant drugs, imatinib and dasatinib, provoke distinct alterations in the electrophoretic mobility of Gab2, its signalling output and protein interactions. As the signalling potential of the docking protein is highly modulated by its phosphorylation status, we set out to obtain more insights into the impact of TKIs on Gab2 phosphorylation.",Chronic myeloid leukaemia;Bcr-Abl;Gab2;Tyrosine kinase inhibitor;Imatinib;Dasatinib;SILAC-based mass spectrometry;Proteomics;Casein kinase;Protein phosphorylation

A major challenge in these efforts is how to bridge spatial and temporal scales over many orders of magnitude. Furthermore, there are additional challenges in integrating different aspects ranging from questions about biomolecular stability in crowded environments to the description of reactive processes on cellular scales. In this review, recent studies with models of biomolecules in cellular environments at different levels of detail are discussed in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. In particular, atomistic models, implicit representations of cellular environments, coarse-grained and spheroidal models of biomolecules, as well as the inclusion of reactive processes via reaction-diffusion models are described.

Most known regulators act during late cytokinesis; a few, including the myosin II–binding proteins anillin and supervillin, act earlier. Anillin's role in scaffolding the membrane cortex with the central spindle is well established, but the mechanism of supervillin action is relatively uncharacterized. We show here that two regions within supervillin affect cell division: residues 831–1281, which bind central spindle proteins, and residues 1–170, which bind the myosin II heavy chain (MHC) and the long form of myosin light-chain kinase. MHC binding is required to rescue supervillin deficiency, and mutagenesis of this site creates a dominant-negative phenotype. Supervillin concentrates activated and total myosin II at the furrow, and simultaneous knockdown of supervillin and anillin additively increases cell division failure. Knockdown of either protein causes mislocalization of the other, and endogenous anillin increases upon supervillin knockdown. Proteomic identification of interaction partners recovered using a high-affinity green fluorescent protein nanobody suggests that supervillin and anillin regulate the myosin II and actin cortical cytoskeletons through separate pathways. We conclude that supervillin and anillin play complementary roles during vertebrate cytokinesis.",

The receptors function in ternary complexes with two other proteins, CheA and CheW, that form extended membrane-bound arrays. Previous studies have shown that attractant binding induces a small (~2 Å) piston displacement of one helix of the periplasmic and transmembrane domains towards the cytoplasm, but it is not clear how this signal propagates through the cytoplasmic domain to control the kinase activity of the CheA bound at the membrane-distal tip, nearly 200 Å away. The cytoplasmic domain has been shown to be highly dynamic, which raises the question of how a small piston motion could propagate through a dynamic domain to control CheA kinase activity. To address this, we have developed a method for measuring dynamics of the receptor cytoplasmic fragment (CF) in functional complexes with CheA and CheW. Hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) measurements of global exchange of CF demonstrate that CF exhibits significantly slower exchange in functional complexes than in solution. Since the exchange rates in functional complexes are comparable to that of other proteins of similar structure, the CF appears to be a well-structured protein within these complexes, which is compatible with its role in propagating a signal that appears to be a tiny conformational change in the periplasmic and transmembrane domains of the receptor. We also demonstrate the feasibility of this protocol for local exchange measurements, by incorporating a pepsin digest step to produce peptides with 87% sequence coverage and only 20% back exchange. This method extends HDX-MS to membrane-bound functional complexes without detergents that may perturb the stability or structure of the system.",

Prostate-associated gene 4 (PAGE4) is a Cancer/Testis Antigen (CTA) that was previously shown to be up-regulated in prostate cancer (PCa) and symptomatic as opposed to histologic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). However, its functional role in these diseases is not fully understood. Methods: The mRNA level of PAGE4 was detected in isolated cell types in PCa tissues that were obtained from 8 men with PCa. PAGE4 protein expression profile was analyzed in a prostate disease tissue microarray. PAGE4 was overexpressed by pCMV-PAGE4-GFP transfection and cell viability was determined using the WST-1 assay. Results: PAGE4 expression is highly dynamic; while its expression is very high in fetal prostate it is drastically decreased in the normal adult prostate but is up-regulated both in symptomatic BPH and PCa. However, in the diseased prostate, PAGE4 is highly expressed in the epithelial cells of Proliferative Inflammatory Atrophy (PIA) lesions alluding to a potential stress response function of PAGE4. Consistent with such a role, PAGE4 protein levels are up-regulated when prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines are treated with various stress factors including the proinflammatory cytokine TNFα. Interestingly, in cells challenged with stress there is increased translocation of the PAGE4 protein to the mitochondrion and production of reactive oxygen species is suppressed . Furthermore, p21 is elevated in a p53-independent manner in PAGE4-overexpressing cells which results in impeded cell cycle progression, attenuated stress-induced DNA damage, and decreased cell death. Conclusions: PAGE4 may be contributing to the development of PCa by playing a stress-protective and anti-apoptotic role.",PAGE4;prostate cancer;Cancer/Testis Antigen;stress-response;proliferative inf﻿l ammatory atrophy

To understand how polar organizing centers are established by PopZ, we investigated a set of mutated PopZ proteins for defects in sub-cellular localization and recruitment activity. We identified a domain within the C-terminal 76 amino acids that is necessary and sufficient for accumulation as a single subcellular focus, a domain within the N-terminal 23 amino acids that is necessary for bipolar targeting, and a linker domain between these localization determinants that tolerates large variation. Mutations that inhibited dynamic PopZ localization inhibited the recruitment of other factors to cell poles. Mutations in the C-terminal domain also blocked discrete steps in the assembly of higher-order structures. Biophysical analysis of purified wildtype and assembly-defective mutant proteins indicates that PopZ self-associates into an elongated trimer, which readily forms a dimer of trimers through lateral contact. The final six amino acids of PopZ are necessary for connecting the hexamers into filaments, and these structures are important for sub-cellular localization. Thus, PopZ undergoes multiple orders of self-assembly, and the formation of an interconnected superstructure is a key feature of polar organization in Caulobacter.",

Two disorders associated with human amelogenesis imperfecta are the point mutations T21→I or P40→T in amelogenin, the dominant protein present in ameloblasts during the early stages of enamel biomineralization. The biophysical properties of wildtype murine amelogenin (M180) and two proteins containing the equivalent mutations in murine amelogenin, T21→I (M180-I) and P41→T (M180-T), were probed by NMR spectroscopy. At low protein concentration (0.1 mM) M180, M180-I, and M180-T are predominately monomeric at pH 3.0 in 2% acetic acid and neither mutation produces a major structural change. Chemical shift perturbation studies as a function of protein (0.1 to 1.8 mM) and NaCl (0 to 400 mM) concentration show that the mutations affect the self-association properties by causing self-assembly at lower protein or salt concentrations, relative to wildtype amelogenin, with the largest effect observed for M180-I. Under both conditions, the premature self-assembly is initiated near the N-terminus, providing further evidence for the importance of this region in the self-assembly process. The self-association of M180-I and M180-T at lower protein concentrations and lower ionic strengths than wildtype M180 may account for the clinical phenotypes of these mutations, defective enamel formation.",amelogenesis imperfecta;intrinsic disorder;amelogenin;enamel;biomineralization;nanospheres

SSB functions as a homotetramer with each subunit possessing a DNA binding domain (OB-fold) and an intrinsically disordered C-terminus, of which the last nine amino acids provide the site for interaction with at least a dozen other proteins that function in DNA metabolism. To examine how many C-termini are needed for SSB function we engineered covalently linked forms of SSB that possess only one or two C-termini within a four OB-fold “tetramer”. Whereas E. coli expressing SSB with only two tails can survive, expression of a single tailed SSB is dominant lethal. E. coli expressing only the two-tailed SSB recovers faster from exposure to DNA damaging agents, but accumulate more mutations. A single-tailed SSB shows defects in coupled leading and lagging strand DNA replication and does not support replication restart in vitro. These deficiencies in vitro provide a plausible explanation for the lethality observed in vivo. These results indicate that a single SSB tetramer must interact simultaneously with multiple protein partners during some essential roles in genome maintenance.",Single Strand DNA binding protein;SSB;DNA Replication;DNA Repair;DNA Binding

Nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) carry cargos through NPCs by transiently binding to phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats on intrinsically disordered polypeptides decorating the NPCs. Major impediments to understand the transport mechanism are the thousands of FG binding sites on each NPC, whose spatial distribution is unknown, and multiple binding sites per NTR, which leads to multivalent interactions. Using single molecule fluorescence microscopy, we show that multiple NTR molecules are required for efficient transport of a large cargo, while a single NTR promotes binding to the NPC but not transport. Particle trajectories and theoretical modelling reveal a crucial role for multivalent NTR interactions with the FG network and indicate a non-uniform FG repeat distribution. A quantitative model is developed wherein the cytoplasmic side of the pore is characterized by a low effective concentration of free FG repeats and a weak FG-NTR affinity, and the centrally located dense permeability barrier is overcome by multivalent interactions, which provide the affinity necessary to permeate the barrier.",avidity;diffusion;FG nucleoporins;nuclear pore complex;single molecule fluorescence

Small chemical compounds that modulate the specific activity of phosphatases can be powerful tools to elucidate the biological functions of these enzymes. More importantly, many phosphatases are central players in the development of pathological pathways where inactivation can reverse or delay the onset of human diseases. Therefore, potent inhibitors for such phosphatases can be of great therapeutic benefit. In contrast to the seemingly identical enzymatic mechanism and structural characterization of eukaryotic protein kinases, protein phosphatases evolved from diverse ancestors, resulting in different domain architectures, reaction mechanisms and active site properties. In this review, we will discuss for each family of serine/threonine protein phosphatases, their involvement in biological process and corresponding strategies for small chemical intervention. Recent advances in modern drug discovery technologies have markedly facilitated the identification of selective inhibitors for some members of the phosphatase family. Furthermore, the rapid growth in knowledge about structure-activity relationships related to possible new drug targets has aided the discovery of natural product inhibitors for phosphatase family. This review summarizes the current state of investigation of the small molecules that regulate the function of serine/threonine phosphatases, the challenges presented and also strategies to overcome these obstacles.",Serine/threonine protein phosphatase;drug design;structure-guided drug discovery;high throughput assay;small molecule inhibitors

Adams: ude.dscu@smada2j","SR proteins are essential splicing factors whose biological function is regulated through phosphorylation of their C-terminal RS domains. Prior studies have shown that cytoplasmic–nuclear translocalization of the SR protein SRSF1 is regulated by multisite phosphorylation of a long Arg-Ser repeat in the N-terminus of the RS domain while subnuclear localization is controlled by phosphorylation of a shorter Arg-Ser repeat along with several Ser-Pro dipeptides in the C-terminus of the RS domain. To better understand how these two kinases partition Arg-Ser versus Ser-Pro specificities, we monitored the phosphorylation of SRSF1 by CLK1 and SRPK1. Although SRPK1 initially binds at the center of the RS domain phosphorylating in an orderly, N-terminal direction, CLK1 makes widespread contacts in the RS domain and generates multiple enzyme–substrate complexes that induce a random addition mechanism. While SRPK1 rapidly phosphorylates N-terminal serines, SRPK1 and CLK1 display similar activities toward Arg-Ser repeats in the C-terminus, suggesting that these kinases may not separate function in a strict linear manner along the RS domain. CLK1 induces a unique gel shift in SRSF1 that is not the result of enhanced Arg-Ser phosphorylation but rather is the direct result of the phosphorylation of several Ser-Pro dipeptides. These prolines are important for binding and phosphorylation of the SR protein by CLK1 but not for the SRPK1-dependent reaction. The data establish a new view of SR protein regulation in which SRPK1 and CLK1 partition activities based on Ser-Pro versus Arg-Ser placement rather than on N- and C-terminal preferences along the RS domain.",kinase;kinetics;phosphorylation;splicing;SR protein

dynamics (REMD) simulations utilize several replicas at different
temperatures that exchange throughout the course of the simulation
in order to allow the sampling of different minimum energy conformations
within the same simulation, unlike classical MD.47 As a result, REMD simulations provide enhanced conformational
sampling of protein structures, which is a necessity for simulations
of intrinsically disordered proteins.47,48 Therefore,
we performed REMD simulations on the full length wild-type and A30P
mutant-type αS proteins using the Onufriev–Bashford–Case
generalized Born implicit solvent model.47,49 An implicit
solvent model was used in order to prevent errors due to confined
aqueous volume or nonconstant heat capacity in explicit water REMD
simulations.37,38 The REMD simulations were performed
with the AMBER 11 software package along with Amber ff99SB potential
functions for the protein.50,51 A total number of 56
replicas were utilized with temperatures exponentially distributed
between 283 and 490 K.52 The initial structures
were equilibrated for 500 ns for each replica with a time step of
2 fs. Each replica was then simulated for a total of 40 ns with exchanges
attempted every 5 ps while trajectories were saved every 500 steps.
Langevin dynamics with a collision frequency of 2 ps–1 was used to control the temperature.53,54 The particle
mesh Ewald method with a cutoff value of 450 Å was used to treat
the long-range interactions, and bonds were constrained using the
SHAKE algorithm.53,54 Based on the cumulative secondary
structure abundance,37,38 we concluded that both the wild-type
and A30P mutant-type αS simulations reached convergence after
20 ns of simulation per replica (see the Supporting
Information). The structural and thermodynamic properties of
the structures obtained after convergence were calculated for the
replica closest to physiological temperature (310 K). The DSSP program,
which incorporates hydrogen bond criteria, was used to analyze the
secondary structure components of the wild- and A30P mutant-type αS.55 In addition, the stability of residual secondary
structure transitions of the wild-type and A30P mutant-type αS
was assessed using our recently published theoretical strategy.39,40 Intramolecular interactions were considered to occur if at least
one heavy atom (C, O, N, S) of a specific residue was at least ≤20
Å from the heavy atom of another residue. A cutoff distance of
20 Å was utilized in order to account for any long-range intramolecular
interactions observed experimental from residual dipolar coupling
measurements. Thermodynamic analysis was performed on the 20 000
structures obtained after convergence for both the wild-type and A30P
mutant-type αS using the molecular mechanics/Poisson–Boltzmann
surface area (MM/PBSA) method and potential mean force (PMF) calculations.37,38,56,57 The PMF calculations were based on coordinates of end-to-end distance
(RE-E), which is the distance between
the N-terminus backbone N atom and the C-terminus backbone carboxyl
O atom, and radius of gyration (Rg) as
in our previous studies with intrinsically disordered fibrillogenic
peptides.37,38 The thermodynamic calculations utilizing
the MM/PBSA method used dielectric constant values of 1 and 80 for
the protein and solvent environment, respectively. Furthermore, the
entropy values were estimated using the normal-mode analysis (NMA).58 Quasi-harmonic entropy calculations using the

However, experimental assessment of such local friction is difficult because it does not manifest itself as an independent experimental observable. Herein, we demonstrate, using the miniprotein trp-cage as a testbed, that it is possible to selectively increase the local mass density in a protein and hence the magnitude of local friction, thus making its effect directly measureable via folding kinetic studies. Specifically, we show that when a helix cross-linker, m-xylene, is placed near the most congested region of the trp-cage it leads to a significant decrease in both the folding rate (by a factor of 3.8) and unfolding rate (by a factor of 2.5 at 35 °C), but has little effect on protein stability. Thus, these results, in conjunction with those obtained with another cross-linked trp-cage and two uncross-linked variants, demonstrate the feasibility of using a non-perturbing cross-linker to help quantify the effect of internal friction. In addition, we estimate that an m-xylene cross-linker could lead to an increase in the roughness of the folding energy landscape by as much as 0.4-1.0kBT.",Protein folding;Cross-linker;Temperature-jump;Infrared;Relaxation kinetics

We find that both peptides have a diverse set of secondary structure elements including turns, helices, and antiparallel and parallel β-strands. The most significant difference in the structural ensembles of the two peptides is the type of β-hairpins and β-strands they populate. We find that Aβ42 forms a major antiparallel β-hairpin involving the central hydrophobic cluster residues (16–21) with residues 29–36, compatible with known amyloid fibril forming regions, whereas Aβ40 forms an alternative but less populated antiparallel β-hairpin between the central hydrophobic cluster and residues 9–13, that sometimes forms a β-sheet by association with residues 35–37. Furthermore, we show that the two additional C-terminal residues of Aβ42, in particular Ile-41, directly control the differences in the β-strand content found between the Aβ40 and Aβ42 structural ensembles. Integrating the experimental and theoretical evidence accumulated over the last decade, it is now possible to present monomeric structural ensembles of Aβ40 and Aβ42 consistent with available information that produce a plausible molecular basis for why Aβ42 exhibits greater fibrillization rates than Aβ40.",

Here, we identify PP5 in stable complexes with extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). Studies using mutant proteins reveal that the formation of PP5·ERK1 and PP5·ERK2 complexes partially depends on HSP90 binding to PP5 but does not require PP5 or ERK1/2 activity. However, PP5 and ERK activity regulates the phosphorylation state of Raf1 kinase, an upstream activator of ERK signaling. Whereas expression of constitutively active Rac1 promotes the assembly of PP5·ERK1/2 complexes, acute activation of ERK1/2 fails to influence the phosphatase-kinase interaction. Introduction of oncogenic HRas (HRasV12) has no effect on PP5-ERK1 binding but selectively decreases the interaction of PP5 with ERK2, in a manner that is independent of PP5 and MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) activity, yet paradoxically requires ERK2 activity. Additional studies conducted with oncogenic variants of KRas4B reveal that KRasL61, but not KRasV12, also decreases the PP5-ERK2 interaction. The expression of wild type HRas or KRas proteins fails to reduce PP5-ERK2 binding, indicating that the effect is specific to HRasV12 and KRasL61 gain-of-function mutations. These findings reveal a novel, differential responsiveness of PP5-ERK1 and PP5-ERK2 interactions to select oncogenic Ras variants and also support a role for PP5·ERK complexes in regulating the feedback phosphorylation of PP5-associated Raf1.",ERK;MAP Kinases (MAPKs);Rac;Raf;Ras;S100 Proteins;MEK;PP5;Feedback Phosphorylation;Small G Protein

Huber","CAPN3/p94/calpain-3 is a skeletal-muscle-specific member of the calpain protease family. Multiple muscle cell functions have been reported for CAPN3, and mutations in this protease cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that allow CAPN3 to be so multifunctional. One hypothesis is that the very rapid and exhaustive autolytic activity of CAPN3 needs to be suppressed by dynamic molecular interactions for specific periods of time. The previously identified interaction between CAPN3 and connectin/titin, a giant molecule in muscle sarcomeres, supports this assumption; however, the regulatory mechanisms of non-sarcomere-associated CAPN3 are unknown. Here, we report that a novel CAPN3-binding protein, PLEIAD [Platform element for inhibition of autolytic degradation; originally called SIMC1/C5orf25 (SUMO-interacting motif containing protein 1/chromosome 5 open reading frame 25)], suppresses the protease activity of CAPN3. Database analyses showed that PLEIAD homologs, like CAPN3 homologs, are evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates. Furthermore, we found that PLEIAD also interacts with CTBP1 (C-terminal binding protein 1), a transcriptional co-regulator, and CTBP1 is proteolyzed in COS7 cells expressing CAPN3. The identified cleavage sites in CTBP1 suggested that it undergoes functional modification upon its proteolysis by CAPN3, as well as by conventional calpains. These results indicate that PLEIAD can shift its major function from CAPN3 suppression to CAPN3-substrate recruitment, depending on the cellular context. Taken together, our data suggest that PLEIAD is a novel regulatory scaffold for CAPN3, as reflected in its name.",calpain;skeletal muscle;autolysis;scaffold;substrate

Pepsin, a zymogen-derived enzyme, without its prosegment (PS), is irreversibly denatured and folds to a thermodynamically stable, non-native conformation, termed refolded pepsin, which is separated from native pepsin by a large activation barrier. While it is known that PS binds refolded pepsin and catalyzes its conversion to the native form, little structural details are known regarding this conversion. In this study, solution NMR was used to elucidate the PS-catalyzed folding mechanism by examining the key equilibrium states, e.g. native and refolded pepsin, both in the free and PS-bound states, and pepsinogen, the zymogen form of pepsin. Refolded pepsin was found to be partially structured and lacked the correct domain-domain structure and active-site cleft formed in the native state. Analysis of chemical shift data revealed that upon PS binding refolded pepsin folds into a state more similar to that of pepsinogen than to native pepsin. Comparison of pepsin folding by wild-type and mutant PSs, including a double mutant PS, indicated that hydrophobic interactions between residues of prosegment and refolded pepsin lower the folding activation barrier. A mechanism is proposed for the binding of PS to refolded pepsin and how the formation of the native structure is mediated.",Aspartic Protease;NMR;Peptide Interactions;Peptides;Protein Folding;Prosegment

Therefore, the macromolecule needs to be represented by an ensemble of conformations instead of a single conformation. Determining this ensemble is challenging because the experimental data are a convoluted average of contributions from multiple conformations. As the number of the ensemble degrees of freedom generally greatly exceeds the number of independent observables, directly deconvolving experimental data into a representative ensemble is an ill-posed problem. Recent developments in sparse approximations and compressive sensing have demonstrated that useful information can be recovered from underdetermined (ill-posed) systems of linear equations by using sparsity regularization. Inspired by these advances, we designed Sparse Ensemble Selection (SES) method for recovering multiple conformations from a limited number of observations. SES is more general and accurate than previously published minimum-ensemble methods, and we use it to obtain representative conformational ensembles of Lys48-linked di-ubiquitin, characterized by the residual dipolar coupling data measured at several pH conditions. These representative ensembles are validated against NMR chemical shift perturbation data and compared to maximum-entropy results. The SES method reproduced and quantified the previously observed pH dependence of the major conformation of Lys48-linked di-ubiquitin, and revealed lesser-populated conformations that are pre-organized for binding known di-ubiquitin receptors, thus providing insights into possible mechanisms of receptor recognition by polyubiquitin. SES is applicable to any experimental observables that can be expressed as a weighted linear combination of data for individual states.",

These protonation changes result in proton uptake/release, which in turn causes the pH-dependence of the binding. Indeed, experimental data strongly suggests that almost any binding is pH-dependent and to be correctly modeled, the protonation states must be properly assigned prior to and after the binding. One may accurately predict the protonation states when provided with the structures of the unbound proteins and their complex; however, the modeling becomes much more complicated if the bound state has to be predicted in a docking protocol or if the structures of either bound or unbound receptor-ligand are not available. The major challenges that arise in these situations are the coupling between binding and protonation states, and the conformational changes induced by the binding and ionization states of titratable groups. In addition, any assessment of the protonation state, either before or after binding, must refer to the pH of binding, which is frequently unknown. Thus, even if the pKa’s of ionizable groups can be correctly assigned for both unbound and bound state, without knowing the experimental pH one cannot assign the corresponding protonation states, and consequently one cannot calculate the resulting proton uptake/release. It is pointed out, that while experimental pH may not be the physiological pH and binding may involve proton uptake/release, there is a tendency that the native receptor-ligand complexes have evolved toward specific either subcellular or tissue characteristic pH at which the proton uptake/release is either minimal or absent.",protonation states;receptor-ligand interactions;pKa calculations;pH-dependence;electrostatics

Incoming data reveal that the virus is highly virulent to humans. A model that categorizes coronaviuses according to the hardness of their shells was developed before the discovery of MERS-CoV. Using protein intrinsic disorder prediction, coronaviruses were categorized into three groups that can be linked to the levels of oral-fecal and respiratory transmission regardless of genetic proximity. Using this model, MERS-CoV is placed into disorder group C, which consists of coronaviruses that have relatively hard inner and outer shells. The members of this group are likely to persist in the environment for a longer period of time and possess the highest oral-fecal components but relatively low respiratory transmission components. Oral-urine and saliva transmission are also highly possible since both require harder protective shells. Results show that disorder prediction can be used as a tool that suggests clues to look for in further epidemiological investigations.",

Compatibility is controlled by so-called het loci and fusion of strains of unlike het genotype triggers a complex incompatibility reaction that leads to the death of the fusion cell. Herein, we analyze the transcriptional changes during the incompatibility reaction in Podospora anserina. The incompatibility response was found to be associated with a massive transcriptional reprogramming: 2231 genes were up-regulated by a factor 2 or more during incompatibility. In turn, 2441 genes were down-regulated. HET, NACHT, and HeLo domains previously found to be involved in the control of heterokaryon incompatibility were enriched in the up-regulated gene set. In addition, incompatibility was characterized by an up-regulation of proteolytic and other hydrolytic activities, of secondary metabolism clusters and toxins and effector-like proteins. The up-regulated set was found to be enriched for proteins lacking orthologs in other species and chromosomal distribution of the up-regulated genes was uneven with up-regulated genes residing preferentially in genomic islands and on chromosomes IV and V. There was a significant overlap between regulated genes during incompatibility in P. anserina and Neurospora crassa, indicating similarities in the incompatibility responses in these two species. Globally, this study illustrates that the expression changes occurring during cell fusion incompatibility in P. anserina are in several aspects reminiscent of those described in host-pathogen or symbiotic interactions in other fungal species.",Podospora anserina;heterokaryon incompatibility;nonself recognition;STAND proteins;HET domain

The authors of this article have studied how structural coverage of the protein-sequence space has changed over time by monitoring the number of Pfam families that acquired their first representative structure each year from 1976 to 2012. Twenty years ago, for every 100 new PDB entries released, an estimated 20 Pfam families acquired their first structure. By 2012, this decreased to only about five families per 100 structures. The reasons behind the slower pace at which previously uncharacterized families are being structurally covered were investigated. It was found that although more than 50% of current Pfam families are still without a structural representative, this set is enriched in families that are small, functionally uncharacterized or rich in problem features such as intrinsically disordered and transmembrane regions. While these are important constraints, the reasons why it may not yet be time to give up the pursuit of a targeted but more comprehensive structural coverage of the protein-sequence space are discussed.",Pfam families;structural coverage;protein-sequence space

Effector N termini are thought to contain the signal, but they lack homology, possess no identifiable motif, and adopt intrinsically disordered structures. Alternative studies suggest that RNA-encoded signals may also be recognized and that they can be located in the 5′ untranslated leader sequence. We began our study by establishing the minimum sequence required for reporter translocation. Untranslated leader sequences predicted from 42 different Salmonella effector proteins were fused to the adenylate cyclase reporter (CyaA′), and each of them was tested for protein injection into J774 macrophages. RNA sequences derived from five effectors, gtgA, cigR, gogB, sseL, and steD, were sufficient for CyaA′ translocation into host cells. To determine the mechanism of signal recognition, we identified proteins that bound specifically to the gtgA RNA. One of the unique proteins identified was Hfq. Hfq had no effect upon the translocation of full-length CigR and SteD, but injection of intact GtgA, GogB, and SseL was abolished in an hfq mutant, confirming the importance of Hfq. Our results demonstrated that the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2) T3SS assembled into a functional apparatus independently of Hfq. Since particular effectors required Hfq for translocation, Hfq-RNA complexes may participate in signal recognition.",

Using analytically derived expression for the partition function we determine the phase diagram for the model in the f-temperature (T) plane. A square root singularity in the susceptibility indicates a second order phase transition from a folded to an unfolded state at a critical force (fc) in the thermodynamic limit of infinitely long polymer chain. The temperature dependence of fc shows a reentrant phase transition, which is reflected in an increase in fc as T increases below a threshold value. As a result, for a range of f values, the unfolded state is stable at both low and high temperatures. The high temperature unfolded state is stabilized by entropy whereas the low temperature unfolded state is dominated by favorable energy. The exact calculation could serve as a benchmark for testing approximate theories that are used in analyzing single molecule pulling experiments.",

Despite this fact, the inciting events leading to TDP-43 aggregation remain unclear. We observed that endogenous TDP-43 undergoes reversible aggregation in the nucleus after the heat shock and that this behavior is mediated by the C-terminal prion domain. Substitution of the prion domain from TIA-1 or an authentic yeast prion domain from RNQ1 into TDP-43 can completely recapitulate heat shock-induced aggregation. TDP-43 is constitutively bound to members of the Hsp40/Hsp70 family, and we found that heat shock-induced TDP-43 aggregation is mediated by the availability of these chaperones interacting with the inherently disordered C-terminal prion domain. Finally, we observed that the aggregation of TDP-43 during heat shock led to decreased binding to hnRNPA1, and a change in TDP-43 RNA-binding partners suggesting that TDP-43 aggregation alters its function in response to misfolded protein stress. These findings indicate that TDP-43 shares properties with physiologic prions from yeast, in that self-aggregation is mediated by a Q/N-rich disordered domain, is modulated by chaperone proteins and leads to altered function of the protein. Furthermore, they indicate that TDP-43 aggregation is regulated by chaperone availability, explaining the recurrent observation of TDP-43 aggregates in degenerative diseases of both the brain and muscle where protein homeostasis is disrupted.",

Tamm (ude.ainigriv@e2tkl) Telephone: 1-434-982-3578","Lipid solvation provides the primary driving force for the insertion and folding of integral membrane proteins. Although the structure of the lipid bilayer is often simplified as a central hydrophobic core sandwiched between two hydrophilic interfacial regions, the complexity of the liquid-crystalline bilayer structure and the gradient of water molecules across the bilayer finetune the energetic contributions of individual amino acid residues to the stability of membrane proteins at different depths of the bilayer. The tryptophan side-chain is particularly interesting because despite its widely recognized role in anchoring membrane proteins in lipid bilayers, there is little consensus on its hydrophobicity among various experimentally determined hydrophobicity scales. Here we investigated how lipid-facing tryptophan residues located at different depths in the bilayer contribute to the stability of integral membrane proteins using the outer membrane protein A (OmpA) as a model. We replaced all lipid-contacting residues of the first transmembrane β-strand of OmpA with alanines and individually incorporated tryptophans in these positions along the strand. By measuring the thermodynamic stability of these proteins, we found that OmpA is slightly more stable when tryptophans are placed in the center of the bilayer and that it is somewhat destabilized as tryptophans approach the interfacial region. However, this trend may be partially reversed when a moderate concentration of urea rather than water is taken as the reference state. The measured stability profiles are driven by similar profiles of the m-value, a parameter that reflects the shielding of hydrophobic surface area from water. Our results indicate that knowledge of the free energy level of the protein’s unfolded reference state is important for quantitatively assessing the stability of membrane proteins, which may explain differences in observed profiles between in vivo and in vitro scales.",

Recent evidence suggests that linker histones also may function through protein–protein interactions. To gain a better understanding of the scope of linker histone involvement in protein–protein interactions, we used a proteomics approach to identify H1-binding proteins in human nuclear extracts. Full-length H1.0 and H1.0 lacking its C-terminal domain (CTD) were used for protein pull-downs. A total of 107 candidate H1.0 binding proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS. About one-third of the H1.0-dependent interactions were mediated by the CTD, and two-thirds by the N-terminal domain-globular domain fragment. Many of the proteins pulled down by H1.0 were core splicing factors. Another group of H1-binding proteins functions in rRNA biogenesis. H1.0 also pulled down numerous ribosomal proteins and proteins involved in cellular transport. Strikingly, nearly all of the H1.0-binding proteins are found in the nucleolus. Quantitative biophysical studies with recombinant proteins confirmed that H1.0 directly binds to FACT and the splicing factors SF2/ASF and U2AF65. Our results demonstrate that H1.0 interacts with an extensive network of proteins that function in RNA metabolism in the nucleolus, and suggest that a new paradigm for linker histone action is in order.",

In large monomeric proteins, the common occurrence of frequency degeneracies between residues impedes unambiguous assignment of NMR signals. To overcome this barrier, non-uniform sampling is used to measure spectra with optimal resolution within reasonable time, new correlation maps resolve previous impasses in assignment strategies, and novel selective methyl labeling schemes provide additional structural probes without cluttering NMR spectra. These advances push the limits of NMR studies of large monomeric proteins. Large multimeric and multi-domain proteins are studied by NMR when individual components can also be studied by NMR and have known structures. The structural properties of large assemblies are obtained by identifying binding surfaces, by orienting domains, and employing limited distance constraints. Segmental labeling and the combination of NMR with other methods have helped popularise NMR studies of such systems.",

Elcock: ude.awoiu@kcocle-nairda ","Coarse-grained (CG) simulation methods are now widely used to model the structure and dynamics of large biomolecular systems. One important issue for using such methods – especially with regard to using them to model, for example, intracellular environments – is to demonstrate that they can reproduce experimental data on the thermodynamics of protein-protein interactions in aqueous solutions. To examine this issue, we describe here simulations performed using the popular coarse-grained MARTINI force field, aimed at computing the thermodynamics of lysozyme and chymotrypsinogen self-interactions in aqueous solution. Using molecular dynamics simulations to compute potentials of mean force between a pair of protein molecules, we show that the original parameterization of the MARTINI force field is likely to significantly overestimate the strength of protein-protein interactions to the extent that the computed osmotic second virial coefficients are orders of magnitude more negative than experimental estimates. We then show that a simple down-scaling of the van der Waals parameters that describe the interactions between protein pseudo-atoms can bring the simulated thermodynamics into much closer agreement with experiment. Overall, the work shows that it is feasible to test explicit-solvent CG force fields directly against thermodynamic data for proteins in aqueous solutions, and highlights the potential usefulness of osmotic second virial coefficient measurements for fully parameterizing such force fields.",

Jordan)","The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator protein (CFTR) is a member of the ABC transporter superfamily. CFTR is distinguished from all other members of this superfamily by its status as an ion channel as well as the presence of its unique regulatory (R) domain. We investigated the origin and subsequent evolution of the R domain along the CFTR evolutionary lineage. The R domain protein coding sequence originated via the loss of a splice donor site at the 3′ end of exon 14, leading to the subsequent read-through and capture of formerly intronic sequence as novel coding sequence. Inclusion of the remaining part of the R domain coding sequence in the CFTR transcript involved a lineage-specific gain of exonic sequence with no homology to protein coding sequences outside of CFTR and loss of two exons conserved among ABC family members. These events occurred at the base of the Gnathostome evolutionary lineage ~550–650 million years ago. The apparent origination of the R domain de novo from previously non-coding sequence is consistent with its lack of sequence similarity to other domains as well as its intrinsically disordered structure, which has important implications for its function. In particular, this lack of structure may provide for a dynamic and inducible regulatory activity based on transient physical interactions with more structured domains of the protein. Since its acquisition along the CFTR evolutionary lineage, the R domain has evolved more rapidly than any other CFTR domain; however, there is no evidence for positive (adaptive) selection in the evolution of the domain. The R domain does show a distinct pattern of relative evolutionary rates compared to other CFTR domains, which sheds additional light on the connection between its function and evolution. The regulatory function of the R domain is dependent upon a fairly small number of sites that are subject to phosphorylation, and these sites were fixed very early in R domain evolution and have remained largely invariant since that time. In contrast, the rest of the R domain has been free to drift in sequence space leading to a more star-like phylogeny than seen for the other CFTR domains. The case of the R domain suggests that domain acquisition via the de novo creation of coding sequence, and the novel functional utility that such an event would seemingly entail, can be one route by which neo-functionalization is favored to occur.",Cystic fibrosis;R domain;Molecular evolution;Coding sequence;Neo-functionalization

(ude.demssamu@ssor.oznola)","PI(4,5)P2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) is a
relatively common anionic lipid that regulates cellular functions by multiple
mechanisms. Hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 by phospholipase C yields
inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. Phosphorylation by phosphoinositide
3-kinase yields PI(3,4,5)P3, which is a potent signal for survival
and proliferation. Also, PI(4,5)P2 can bind directly to integral and
peripheral membrane proteins. As an example of regulation by
PI(4,5)P2, we discuss phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on
chromosome 10 (PTEN) in detail. PTEN is an important tumor suppressor and
hydrolyzes PI(3,4,5)P3. PI(4,5)P2 enhances PTEN
association with the plasma membrane and activates its phosphatase activity.
This is a critical regulatory mechanism, but a detailed description of this
process from a structural point of view is lacking. The disordered lipid bilayer
environment hinders structural determinations of membrane-bound PTEN. A new
method to analyze membrane-bound protein measures neutron reflectivity for
proteins bound to tethered phospholipid membranes. These methods allow
determination of the orientation and shape of membrane-bound proteins. In
combination with molecular dynamics simulations, these studies will provide
crucial structural information that can serve as a foundation for our
understanding of PTEN regulation in normal and pathological processes.",phosphoinositide;lipid;membrane;PTEN;phosphatase

We consider a statistical mechanical treatment of the biased distribution of such organized states, which become favored as a result of their catalytic activity under chemical driving forces. A generalization of the equilibrium canonical distribution describes the stationary state, which can be used to model shifts in conformational ensembles sampled by an enzyme in working conditions. The basic idea is applied to the process of biological information generation from random sequences of heteropolymers, where unfavorable Shannon entropy is overcome by the catalytic activities of selected genes. The ordering process is demonstrated with the genetic distance to a genotype with high catalytic activity as an order parameter. The resulting free energy can have multiple minima, corresponding to disordered and organized phases with first-order transitions between them.",

Most yeast prions contain glutamine/asparagine (Q/N)-rich domains that promote the formation of amyloid-like prion aggregates. Chaperones, including Hsp104 and Sis1, are required to continually break these aggregates into smaller “seeds.” Decreasing aggregate size and increasing the number of growing aggregate ends facilitates both aggregate transmission and growth. Our previous work showed that overexpression of 11 proteins with Q/N-rich domains facilitates the de novo aggregation of Sup35 into the [PSI+] prion, presumably by a cross-seeding mechanism. We now discuss our recent paper, in which we showed that overexpression of most of these same 11 Q/N-rich proteins, including Pin4C and Cyc8, destabilized pre-existing Q/N rich prions. Overexpression of both Pin4C and Cyc8 caused [PSI+] aggregates to enlarge. This is incompatible with a previously proposed “capping” model where the overexpressed Q/N-rich protein poisons, or “caps,” the growing aggregate ends. Rather the data match what is expected of a reduction in prion severing by chaperones. Indeed, while Pin4C overexpression does not alter chaperone levels, Pin4C aggregates sequester chaperones away from the prion aggregates. Cyc8 overexpression cures [PSI+] by inducing an increase in Hsp104 levels, as excess Hsp104 binds to [PSI+] aggregates in a way that blocks their shearing.",prion;yeast;amyloid;chaperone;Hsp104;Sis1;[PSI+];Sup35;Pin4;Cyc8

The complex acts as a molecular hub for coordinating protein synthesis and diverse regulatory signal pathways. Electron microscopy studies defined its low resolution molecular envelope as an overall rather compact, asymmetric triangular shape. Here, we have analyzed the composition and homogeneity of the native mammalian MARS isolated from rabbit liver and characterized its overall internal structure, size, and shape at low resolution by hydrodynamic methods and small-angle x-ray scattering in solution. Our data reveal that the MARS exhibits a much more elongated and multi-armed shape than expected from previous reports. The hydrodynamic and structural features of the MARS are large compared with other supramolecular assemblies involved in translation, including ribosome. The large dimensions and non-compact structural organization of MARS favor a large protein surface accessibility for all its components. This may be essential to allow structural rearrangements between the catalytic and cis-acting tRNA binding domains of the synthetases required for binding the bulky tRNA substrates. This non-compact architecture may also contribute to the spatiotemporal controlled release of some of its components, which participate in non-canonical functions after dissociation from the complex.",Aminoacyl tRNA Synthetase;Protein Complexes;Protein Structure;Protein Synthesis;X-ray Scattering

Levy: ude.sregtur.ecetul@yvelnor ","Understanding how kinetics in the unfolded state affects protein folding is a fundamentally important yet less well-understood issue. Here we employ three different models to analyze the unfolded landscape and folding kinetics of the miniprotein Trp-cage. The first is a 208 μs explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulation from D. E. Shaw Research containing tens of folding events. The second is a Markov state model (MSM-MD) constructed from the same ultra-long MD simulation; MSM-MD can be used to generate thousands of folding events. The third is a Markov state model built from temperature replica exchange MD simulations in implicit solvent (MSM-REMD). All the models exhibit multiple folding pathways, and there is a good correspondence between the folding pathways from direct MD and those computed from the MSMs. The unfolded populations interconvert rapidly between extended and collapsed conformations on time scales ≤ 40 ns, compared with the folding time of ≈ 5 μs. The folding rates are independent of where the folding is initiated from within the unfolded ensemble. About 90 % of the unfolded states are sampled within the first 40 μs of the ultra-long MD trajectory, which on average explores ~27 % of the unfolded state ensemble between consecutive folding events. We clustered the folding pathways according to structural similarity into “tubes”, and kinetically partitioned the unfolded state into populations that fold along different tubes. From our analysis of the simulations and a simple kinetic model, we find that when the mixing within the unfolded state is comparable to or faster than folding, the folding waiting times for all the folding tubes are similar and the folding kinetics is essentially single exponential despite the presence of heterogeneous folding paths with non-uniform barriers. When the mixing is much slower than folding, different unfolded populations fold independently leading to non-exponential kinetics. A kinetic partition of the Trp-cage unfolded state is constructed which reveals that different unfolded populations have almost the same probability to fold along any of the multiple folding paths. We are investigating whether the results for the kinetics in the unfolded state of the twenty-residue Trp-cage is representative of larger single domain proteins.",Protein Folding;Unfolded State Kinetics

It serves to protect the bacteria in environments that have lethal concentrations of these metals. The membrane fusion protein CusB is the periplasmic piece of CusCFBA, which has not been fully characterized by crystallography due to its extremely disordered N-terminal region. This region has both structural and functional importance as it has been experimentally proven to transfer the metal by itself from the metallochaperone CusF and to induce a structural change in the rest of CusB to increase Cu(I)/Ag(I) resistance. Understanding metal uptake from the periplasm is critical to gain an insight to the mechanism of the whole CusCFBA pump, which makes resolving a structure for the N-terminal region necessary as it contains the metal binding site. We ran extensive molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the structural and dynamic properties of both apo and Cu(I)-bound versions of the CusB N-terminal region. In contrast to its functional companion CusF, Cu(I)-binding to the N-terminal of CusB causes only a slight, local stabilization around the metal site. The trajectories were analyzed in detail revealing extensive structural disorder in both the apo and holo forms of the protein. CusB was further analyzed by breaking the protein up into three subdomains according to the extent of the observed disorder: the N- and C-terminal tails, the central beta strand motif, and the M21–M36 loop connecting the two metal-coordinating methionine residues. Most of the observed disorder was traced back to the tail regions leading us to hypothesize that the latter two subdomains (residues 13–45) may form a functionally competent metal binding domain as the tail regions appear to play no role in metal binding.",CusB;CusCFBA;Cu(I)-transfer;metal transfer;copper resistance;metal homeostasis;intrinsically disordered proteins

Dynein light chain LC8, first discovered as a subunit of the motor protein dynein, is considered to have a role broader than dynein and its participation in diverse systems fits the description of a hub. Among its partners is Swallow with which LC8 is essential for proper localization of bicoid mRNA at the anterior cortex of Drosophila oocytes. Why LC8 is essential in this process is not clear, but emerging evidence suggests that LC8 functions by promoting self-association and/or structural organization of its diverse binding partners. This work addresses the mechanistic and structural features of LC8-induced Swallow self-association distant from LC8 binding. Mutational design based on a hypothetical helical wheel, inter-monomer NOEs assigned to residues expected at interface positions and circular dichroism spectral characteristics indicate that the LC8-promoted dimer of Swallow is a coiled-coil. Secondary chemical shifts and 15N backbone relaxation identify the boundaries and distinguishing structural features of the coiled-coil. Thermodynamic analysis of Swallow polypeptides designed to decouple self-association from LC8 binding reveals that the higher binding affinity of the engineered bivalent Swallow is of purely entropic origin and that the linker separating the coiled-coil from the LC8 binding site remains disordered. We speculate that the LC8-promoted coiled-coil is critical for bicoid mRNA localization because it could induce structural organization of Swallow, which except for the central LC8-promoted coiled-coil is primarily disordered.",

In both cases, the core of the protein adopts a compact helical structure flanked by flexible N and C termini. Remarkably, while the core of FCV VPg contains a well-defined three-helix bundle, the MNV VPg core has just the first two of these secondary structure elements. In both cases, the VPg cores are stabilized by networks of hydrophobic and salt bridge interactions. The Tyr residue in VPg that is nucleotidylated by the viral NS7 polymerase (Y24 in FCV, Y26 in MNV) occurs in a conserved position within the first helix of the core. Intriguingly, given its structure, VPg would appear to be unable to bind to the viral polymerase so as to place this Tyr in the active site without a major conformation change to VPg or the polymerase. However, mutations that destabilized the VPg core either had no effect on or reduced both the ability of the protein to be nucleotidylated and virus infectivity and did not reveal a clear structure-activity relationship. The precise role of the calicivirus VPg core in virus replication remains to be determined, but knowledge of its structure will facilitate future investigations.",

Recently, owing largely to the advent of new disease models, this hypothesis has gained experimental momentum. In a remarkable variety of diseases, specific proteins have been found to misfold and aggregate into seeds that structurally corrupt like proteins, causing them to aggregate and form pathogenic assemblies ranging from small oligomers to large masses of amyloid. Proteinaceous seeds can therefore serve as self-propagating agents for the instigation and progression of disease. Alzheimer’s disease and other cerebral proteopathies seem to arise from the de novo misfolding and sustained corruption of endogenous proteins, whereas prion diseases can also be infectious in origin. However, the outcome in all cases is the functional compromise of the nervous system, because the aggregated proteins gain a toxic function and/or lose their normal function. As a unifying pathogenic principle, the prion paradigm suggests broadly relevant therapeutic directions for a large class of currently intractable diseases.",

CyaA invades target cells by translocating its catalytic domain directly across the plasma membrane and overproduces cAMP, leading to cell death. The molecular process leading to the translocation of the catalytic domain remains largely unknown. We have previously shown that the catalytic domain per se, AC384, encompassing residues 1–384 of CyaA, did not interact with lipid bilayer, whereas a longer polypeptide, AC489, spanning residues 1–489, binds to membranes and permeabilizes vesicles. Moreover, deletion of residues 375–485 within CyaA abrogated the translocation of the catalytic domain into target cells. Here, we further identified within this region a peptidic segment that exhibits membrane interaction properties. A synthetic peptide, P454, corresponding to this sequence (residues 454–485 of CyaA) was characterized by various biophysical approaches. We found that P454 (i) binds to membranes containing anionic lipids, (ii) adopts an α-helical structure oriented in plane with respect to the lipid bilayer, and (iii) permeabilizes vesicles. We propose that the region encompassing the helix 454–485 of CyaA may insert into target cell membrane and induce a local destabilization of the lipid bilayer, thus favoring the translocation of the catalytic domain across the plasma membrane.",Adenylate Cyclase (Adenylyl Cyclase);Bacterial Toxins;Circular Dichroism (CD);Infrared Spectroscopy;Membrane;Molecular Dynamics;Peptide Conformation;Phospholipid Vesicle

ability to interact with different partners is one of the most
important features in proteins. Proteins that bind a large number
of partners (hubs) have been often associated with intrinsic disorder.
However, many examples exist of hubs with an ordered structure, and
evidence of a general mechanism promoting promiscuity in ordered proteins
is still elusive. An intriguing hypothesis is that promiscuous binding
sites have specific dynamical properties, distinct from the rest of
the interface and pre-existing in the protein isolated state. Here,
we present the first comprehensive study of the intrinsic dynamics
of promiscuous residues in a large protein data set. Different computational
methods, from coarse-grained elastic models to geometry-based sampling
methods and to full-atom Molecular Dynamics simulations, were used
to generate conformational ensembles for the isolated proteins. The
flexibility and dynamic correlations of interface residues with a
different degree of binding promiscuity were calculated and compared
considering side chain and backbone motions, the latter both on a
local and on a global scale. The study revealed that (a) promiscuous
residues tend to be more flexible than nonpromiscuous ones, (b) this
additional flexibility has a higher degree of organization, and (c)
evolutionary conservation and binding promiscuity have opposite effects
on intrinsic dynamics. Findings on simulated ensembles were also validated
on ensembles of experimental structures extracted from the Protein
Data Bank (PDB). Additionally, the low occurrence of single nucleotide
polymorphisms observed for promiscuous residues indicated a tendency
to preserve binding diversity at these positions. A case study on
two ubiquitin-like proteins exemplifies how binding promiscuity in
evolutionary related proteins can be modulated by the fine-tuning
of the interface dynamics. The interplay between promiscuity and flexibility
highlighted here can inspire new directions in protein–protein
interaction prediction and design methods.",

To investigate the structural mechanisms of this unexpected force resistance, we perform pulling simulations of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) and α-synuclein (αS), starting from simulated conformational ensembles for the free monomers. For both proteins, the simulations yield a set of rupture events that agree well with the experimental data. By analyzing the conformations occurring shortly before rupture in each event, we find that the mechanically resistant structures share a common architecture, with similarities to the folds adopted by Aβ and αS in amyloid fibrils.

Moreover, a major goal of modern biotechnology is obtaining new potent pharmaceutical agents whose biological action is dependent on the binding of peptides to lipid-bilayers. Several issues need to be addressed such as secondary structure, orientation, oligomerization and localization inside the membrane. At the same time, the structural effects which the peptides cause on the lipid bilayer are important for the interactions and need to be elucidated. The structural characterization of membrane active peptides in membranes is a harsh experimental challenge.

The AFF modification entails duplicating an amino- or carboxy-terminal segment of the protein and appending it to the opposite end of the molecule. This duplication allows the protein to interconvert, in a ligand-dependent fashion, between two mutually exclusive native folds: the wild-type structure and a circularly permuted form. The fold shift can be detected by placement of extrinsic fluorophores at sites sensitive to the engineered conformational change. Here, we apply the AFF mechanism to create several ribose-sensing proteins derived from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis ribose binding protein. Our purpose is to systematically explore the parameters of the AFF design. These considerations include the site of circular permutation, the length and location of the duplicated segment, thermodynamic and kinetic optimization of the switching mechanism, and placement of extrinsic fluorophores. Three of the four AFF variants created here undergo the expected conformational shift and exhibit a ribose-dependent fluorescence change. The fourth construct fails to switch folds upon addition of ribose, likely because the circularly permuted form folds much more slowly than the nonpermuted form. This disparity apparently introduces a kinetic barrier that partitions the refolding molecules to the nonpermuted structure. The results of this study serve as a guideline for applying the AFF modification to other proteins of biomedical, diagnostic, and industrial interest.",

This specialized 3′ end is bound by stem-loop binding protein (SLBP), a protein that participates in the nuclear export and translation of histone mRNAs. The translational activity of SLBP is mediated by interaction with SLIP1, a middle domain of initiation factor 4G (MIF4G)-like protein that connects to translation initiation. We determined the 2.5 Å resolution crystal structure of zebrafish SLIP1 bound to the translation–activation domain of SLBP and identified the determinants of the recognition. We discovered a SLIP1-binding motif (SBM) in two additional proteins: the translation initiation factor eIF3g and the mRNA-export factor DBP5. We confirmed the binding of SLIP1 to DBP5 and eIF3g by pull-down assays and determined the 3.25 Å resolution structure of SLIP1 bound to the DBP5 SBM. The SBM-binding and homodimerization residues of SLIP1 are conserved in the MIF4G domain of CBP80/20-dependent translation initiation factor (CTIF).

Mammalian prions represent a unique class of infectious agents that are composed of misfolded prion protein. Prion proteins usually exist as soluble proteins but can refold and assemble into highly ordered, self-propagating prion polymers. The prion concept is also applicable to a growing number of non-Mendelian elements of inheritance in lower eukaryotes. While prions identified in mammals are clearly pathogens, prions in lower eukaryotes can be either detrimental or beneficial to the host. Prion phenotypes in fungi are transmitted vertically from mother to daughter cells during cell division and horizontally during mating or abortive mating, but extracellular phases have not been reported. Recent findings now demonstrate that in a mammalian cell environment, protein aggregates derived from yeast prion domains exhibit a prion life cycle similar to mammalian prions propagated ex vivo. This life cycle includes a soluble state of the protein, an induction phase by exogenous prion fibrils, stable replication of prion entities, vertical transmission to progeny and natural horizontal transmission to neighboring cells. Our data reveal that mammalian cells contain all co-factors required for cytosolic prion propagation and dissemination. This has important implications for understanding prion-like properties of disease-related protein aggregates. In light of the growing number of identified functional amyloids, cell-to-cell propagation of cytosolic protein conformers might not only be relevant for the spreading of disease-associated proteins, but might also be of more general relevance under non-disease conditions.",Prion;Sup35;amyloid;seeded polymerization

While many biological factors associated with evolutionary rate variations have been studied, evolutionary analysis of simultaneously accounting for TF and miRNA regulations across metazoans is still uninvestigated. Here, we provide a series of statistical analyses to assess the influences of TF and miRNA regulations on evolutionary rates across metazoans (human, mouse and fruit fly). Our results reveal that the negative correlations between trans-regulation and evolutionary rates hold well across metazoans, but the strength of TF regulation as a rate indicator becomes weak when the other confounding factors that may affect evolutionary rates are controlled. We show that miRNA regulation tends to be a more essential indicator of evolutionary rates than TF regulation, and the combination of TF and miRNA regulations has a significant dependent effect on protein evolutionary rates. We also show that trans-regulation (especially miRNA regulation) is much more important in human/mouse than in fruit fly in determining protein evolutionary rates, suggesting a considerable variation in rate determinants between vertebrates and invertebrates.",

The missing helix, helix III, is the shortest and its failure to be formed until late in the pathway is related to frustration in the structure. Im7H3M3, a 94-residue variant of the 87-residue Im7 in which helix III is the longest of the four native helices, also folds via an intermediate. To investigate the structural basis for this we calculated the frustration in the structure of Im7H3M3 and used NMR to investigate its dynamics. We found that the native state of Im7H3M3 is highly frustrated and in equilibrium with an intermediate state that lacks helix III, similar to Im7. Model-free analysis identified residues with chemical exchange contributions to their relaxation that aligned with the residues predicted to have highly frustrated interactions, also like Im7. Finally, we determined properties of urea-denatured Im7H3M3 and identified four clusters of interacting residues that corresponded to the α-helices of the native protein. In Im7 the cluster sizes were related to the lengths of the α-helices with cluster III being the smallest but in Im7H3M3 cluster III was also the smallest, despite this region forming the longest helix in the native state. These results suggest that the conformational properties of the urea-denatured states promote formation of a three-helix intermediate in which the residues that form helix III remain non-helical. Thus it appears that features of the native structure are formed early in folding linked to collapse of the unfolded state.",protein folding;frustration;Im7;NMR

One very productive way to explore the effects of crowding on protein behavior has been to use macromolecular crowding agents that exclude volume without otherwise strongly interacting with the protein under study. An alternative, complementary approach to understanding the potential differences between behavior in vivo and in vitro is to develop simulation models that explicitly attempt to model intracellular environments at the molecular scale, and that thereby can be used to directly monitor biophysical behavior in conditions that accurately mimic those encountered in vivo. It is with studies of this type that the present review will be concerned. We review in detail four published studies that have attempted to simulate the structure and dynamics of the bacterial cytoplasm and that have each explored different biophysical aspects of the cellular interior. While each of these studies has yielded important new insights, there are important questions that remain to be resolved in terms of determining the relative contributions made by energetic and hydrodynamic interactions to the diffusive behavior of macromolecules and to the thermodynamics of protein folding and associations in vivo.

New genomes from a taxonomically broad range of microsporidians, complemented by published expression data, provide an opportunity for comparative analyses to identify conserved and lineage-specific patterns of microsporidian genome evolution that have underpinned this success. In this study, we infer that a dramatic bottleneck in the last common microsporidian ancestor (LCMA) left a small conserved core of genes that was subsequently embellished by gene family expansion driven by gene acquisition in different lineages. Novel expressed protein families represent a substantial fraction of sequenced microsporidian genomes and are significantly enriched for signals consistent with secretion or membrane location. Further evidence of selection is inferred from the gain and reciprocal loss of functional domains between paralogous genes, for example, affecting transport proteins. Gene expansions among transporter families preferentially affect those that are located on the plasma membrane of model organisms, consistent with recruitment to plug conserved gaps in microsporidian biosynthesis and metabolism. Core microsporidian genes shared with other eukaryotes are enriched in orthologs that, in yeast, are highly expressed, highly connected, and often essential, consistent with strong negative selection against further reduction of the conserved gene set since the LCMA. Our study reveals that microsporidian genome evolution is a highly dynamic process that has balanced constraint, reductive evolution, and genome expansion during adaptation to an extraordinarily successful obligate intracellular lifestyle.",Microsporidia;intracellular parasites;evolution;genome reduction;gene duplication;novel gene families

Mutations causing either increased lateral membrane mobility or loss of apical-lateral transcytosis result in partial mis-sorting of E-cadherin in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. However, loss of both activities results in complete loss of polarity. We present evidence that residues required for restricted mobility mediate retention at the lateral membrane through interaction with ankyrin-G, whereas dileucine residues conferring apical-lateral transcytosis act through a clathrin-dependent process and function in an editing pathway. Ankyrin-G interaction with E-cadherin is abolished by the same mutations resulting in increased E-cadherin mobility. Clathrin heavy chain knockdown and dileucine mutation of E-cadherin both cause the same partial loss of polarity of E-cadherin. Moreover, clathrin knockdown causes no further change in polarity of E-cadherin with dileucine mutation but does completely randomize E-cadherin mutants lacking ankyrin-binding. Dileucine mutation, but not loss of ankyrin binding, prevented transcytosis of apically mis-sorted E-cadherin to the lateral membrane. Finally, neurofascin, which binds ankyrin but lacks dileucine residues, exhibited partial apical-lateral polarity that was abolished by mutation of its ankyrin-binding site but was not affected by clathrin knockdown.

Amyloid formation involves the conversion of proteins from their native monomeric states (intrinsically disordered or globular) to well-organized, fibrillar aggregates in a nucleation-dependent manner. Understanding the mechanism of aggregation is important not only to gain better insight into amyloid pathology but also to simulate and predict molecular pathways. One of the main impediments in doing so is the stochastic nature of interactions that impedes thorough experimental characterization and the development of meaningful insights. In this study, we have utilized a well-known intermediate state along the amyloid-β peptide aggregation pathway called protofibrils as a model system to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which they form fibrils using stability and perturbation analysis. Investigation of protofibril aggregation mechanism limits both the number of species to be modeled (monomers, and protofibrils), as well as the reactions to two (elongation by monomer addition, and protofibril–protofibril lateral association). Our new model is a reduced order four species model grounded in mass action kinetics. Our prior study required 3200 reactions, which makes determining the reaction parameters prohibitively difficult. Using this model, along with a linear perturbation argument, we rigorously determine stable ranges of rate constants for the reactions and ensure they are physically meaningful. This was accomplished by finding the ranges in which the perturbations dieout in a five-parameter sweep, which includes the monomer and protofibril equilibrium concentrations and three of the rate constants. The results presented are a proof-of-concept method in determining meaningful rate constants that can be used as a bonafide way for determining accurate rate constants for other models involving complex biological reactions such as amyloid aggregation.",Aβ;Protein aggregation;Mathematical model;Stability;Rate constants

Tropomyosin is an alpha-helical, coiled coil protein that covers the grooves of actin filaments and stabilizes them. Actin filament length is optimized by tropomodulin, which caps the slow growing (pointed end) of thin filaments to inhibit polymerization or depolymerization. Tropomodulin consists of two structurally distinct regions: the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain contains two tropomyosin-binding sites and one tropomyosin-dependent actin-binding site, whereas the C-terminal domain contains a tropomyosin-independent actin-binding site. Tropomodulin binds to two tropomyosin molecules and at least one actin molecule during capping. The interaction of tropomodulin with tropomyosin is a key regulatory factor for actin filament organization. The binding efficacy of tropomodulin to tropomyosin is isoform-dependent. The affinities of tropomodulin/tropomyosin binding influence the proper localization and capping efficiency of tropomodulin at the pointed end of actin filaments in cells. Tropomodulin and tropomyosin are crucial constituents of the actin filament network, making their presence indispensable in living cells. Here we describe how a small difference in the sequence of the tropomyosin-binding sites of tropomodulin may result in dramatic change in localization of Tmod in muscle cells or morphology of non-muscle cells. We also suggest most promising directions to study and elucidate the role of Tmod-TM interaction in formation and maintenance of sarcomeric and cytoskeletal structure.",tropomodulin;tropomyosin;leiomodin;actin filament;pointed end;capping

We find a remarkable complexity in the unfolding of the large HEAT repeat protein PR65/A. In contrast to what has been seen for small repeat proteins in which unfolding propagates from one end, the HEAT array of PR65/A ruptures at multiple distant sites, leading to intermediate states with non-contiguous folded subdomains. Kinetic analysis allows us to define a network of intermediates and to delineate the pathways that connect them. There is a dominant sequence of unfolding, reflecting a non-uniform distribution of stability across the repeat array; however the unfolding of certain intermediates is competitive, leading to parallel pathways. Theoretical models accounting for the heterogeneous contact density in the folded structure are able to rationalize the variation in stability across the array. This variation in stability also suggests how folding may direct function in a large repeat protein: The stability distribution enables certain regions to present rigid motifs for molecular recognition while affording others flexibility to broaden the search area as in a fly-casting mechanism. Thus PR65/A uses the two ends of the repeat array to bind diverse partners and thereby coordinate the dephosphorylation of many different substrates and of multiple sites within hyperphosphorylated substrates.",

Recombinant human Cdc45 (hCdc45) was structurally characterized and its DNA-binding properties were determined. Synchrotron radiation circular dichroism spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy revealed that hCdc45 exists as an alpha-helical monomer and possesses a structure similar to its bacterial homolog RecJ. hCdc45 bound long (113-mer or 80-mer) single-stranded DNA fragments with a higher affinity than shorter ones (34-mer). hCdc45 displayed a preference for 3′ protruding strands and bound tightly to single-strand/double-strand DNA junctions, such as those presented by Y-shaped DNA, bubbles and displacement loops, all of which appear transiently during the initiation of DNA replication. Collectively, our findings suggest that hCdc45 not only binds to but also slides on DNA with a 3′–5′ polarity and, thereby acts as a molecular ‘wedge’ to initiate DNA strand displacement.",

Elcock,"Adrian H. Elcock,  Department of Biochemistry, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA ude.awoiu@kcocle-nairda;","Inclusion of hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) is essential in simulations of biological macromolecules that treat the solvent implicitly if the macromolecules are to exhibit correct translational and rotational diffusion. The present work describes the development and testing of a simple approach aimed at allowing more rapid computation of HIs in coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations of systems that contain large numbers of flexible macromolecules. The method combines a complete treatment of intramolecular HIs with an approximate treatment of the intermolecular HIs which assumes that the molecules are effectively spherical; all of the HIs are calculated at the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa level of theory. When combined with Fixman’s Chebyshev polynomial method for calculating correlated random displacements, the proposed method provides an approach that is simple to program but sufficiently fast that it makes it computationally viable to include HIs in large-scale simulations. Test calculations performed on very coarse-grained models of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) E2 complex and on oligomers of ParM (ranging in size from 1 to 20 monomers) indicate that the method reproduces the translational diffusion behavior seen in more complete HI simulations surprisingly well; the method performs less well at capturing rotational diffusion but its discrepancies diminish with increasing size of the simulated assembly. Simulations of residue-level models of two tetrameric protein models demonstrate that the method also works well when more structurally detailed models are used in the simulations. Finally, test simulations of systems containing up to 1024 coarse-grained PDH molecules indicate that the proposed method rapidly becomes more efficient than the conventional BD approach in which correlated random displacements are obtained via a Cholesky decomposition of the complete diffusion tensor.",

A selective permeability barrier that arises from a supramolecular assembly of intrinsically unfolded nucleoporin domains rich in phenylalanine-glycine dipeptides (FG domains) fills the nuclear pore. There is increasing evidence that selective transport requires cohesive FG domain interactions. To understand the functional roles of cohesive interactions, we studied monolayers of end-grafted FG domains as a bottom-up nanoscale model system of the permeability barrier. Based on detailed physicochemical analysis of the model films and comparison of the data with polymer theory, we propose that cohesiveness is tuned to promote rapid assembly of the permeability barrier and to generate a stable and compact pore-filling meshwork with a small mesh size. Our results highlight the functional importance of weak interactions, typically a few kBT per chain, and contribute important information to understand the mechanism of size-selective transport.",

Kostyukova: ude.usw@avokuytsok.alla ","Assembly of the actin cytoskeleton is an important part of formation of neurites in developing neurons. Tropomodulin, a tropomyosin-dependent capping protein for the pointed end of the actin filament, is one of the key players in this process. Tropomodulin binds tropomyosin in two binding sites. Tmod1 and Tmod2, tropomodulin isoforms found in neurons, were overexpressed in PC12 cells, a model system for neuronal differentiation. Tmod1 did not affect neuronal differentiation; while cells expressing Tmod2 showed a significant reduction in the number and the length of neurites. Both tropomodulins bind short α-, γ- and δ-tropomyosin isoforms. Mutations in one of the tropomyosin-binding sites of Tmod1, which increased its affinity to short γ- and δ-tropomyosin isoforms, caused a decrease in binding short α-tropomyosin isoforms along with a 2-fold decrease in the length of neurites. Our data demonstrate that Tmod1 is involved in neuronal differentiation for proper neurite formation and outgrowth, and that Tmod2 inhibits these processes. The mutations in the tropomyosin-binding site of Tmod1 impair neurite outgrowth, suggesting that the integrity of this binding site is critical for the proper function of Tmod1 during neuronal differentiation.",Tropomodulin;Tropomyosin;Actin;Neurite formation;Cytoskeleton

Translocation is dependent on the presence of secretion signals found in both the N- and C-terminal domains of CagA and an interaction with the accessory protein CagF. However, the molecular basis of this essential protein-protein interaction is not fully understood. Herein we report, using isothermal titration calorimetry, that CagA forms a 1:1 complex with a monomer of CagF with nm affinity. Peptide arrays and isothermal titration calorimetry both show that CagF binds to all five domains of CagA, each with μm affinity. More specifically, a coiled coil domain and a C-terminal helix within CagF contacts domains II-III and domain IV of CagA, respectively. In vivo complementation assays of H. pylori with a double mutant, L36A/I39A, in the coiled coil region of CagF showed a severe weakening of the CagA-CagF interaction to such an extent that it was nearly undetectable. However, it had no apparent effect on CagA translocation. Deletion of the C-terminal helix of CagF also weakened the interaction with CagA but likewise had no effect on translocation. These results indicate that the CagA-CagF interface is distributed broadly across the molecular surfaces of these two proteins to provide maximal protection of the highly labile effector protein CagA.",Cancer;Helicobacter pylori;Protein Secretion;Protein Translocation;Protein-Protein Interactions;CagA;CagF;Type IV Secretion System

Here, we describe an unusual topological structure that the virus uses to recognize its own mRNA. The viral Rev response element (RRE) adopts an “A”-like structure in which the two legs constitute two tracks of binding sites for the viral Rev protein and position the two primary known Rev-binding sites ~55 Å apart, matching the distance between the two RNA-binding motifs in the Rev dimer. Both the legs of the “A” and the separation between them are required for optimal RRE function.

RNA hairpins are frequently capped by tetraloops, and based on sequence similarity, three broad classes of RNA tetraloops have been defined: GNRA, UNCG, and CUYG. Other classes such as the UYUN tetraloop in histone mRNAs, the UGAA in 16S rRNA, the AUUA tetraloop from the MS2 bacteriophage, and the AGNN tetraloop that binds RNase III have also been characterized. The tetraloop structure is compact and is usually characterized by a paired interaction between the first and fourth nucleotides. The two unpaired nucleotides in the loop are usually involved in base-stacking or base-phosphate hydrogen bonding interactions. Several structures of RNA tetraloops, free and complexed to other RNAs or proteins are now available and these studies have increased our understanding of the diverse mechanisms by which this motif is recognized. RNA tetraloops can mediate RNA-RNA contacts via the tetraloop-receptor motif, kissing hairpin loops, A-minor interactions, and pseudoknots. While these RNA-RNA interactions are fairly well-understood, how RNA binding proteins recognize RNA tetraloops and tetraloop-like motifs remains unclear. In this review, we summarize the structures of RNA tetraloop-protein complexes and the general themes that have emerged on sequence and structure-specific recognition of RNA tetraloops. We highlight how proteins achieve molecular recognition of this nucleic acid motif, the structural adaptations observed in the tetraloop to accommodate the protein binding partner, and the role of dynamics in recognition.",

PUMA, unique amongst BH3-only proteins, disrupts the interaction between cytosolic p53 and BCL-xL, allowing p53 to promote apoptosis via direct activation of the BCL-2 effector molecules, BAX and BAK. Structural investigations using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography revealed that PUMA binding induced partial unfolding of two α-helices within BCL-xL. Wild-type PUMA or a PUMA mutant incapable of causing binding-induced unfolding of BCL-xL equivalently inhibited the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 repertoire to sensitize for death receptor (DR)-activated apoptosis, but only wild-type PUMA promoted p53-dependent, DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Our data suggest that PUMA-induced partial unfolding of BCL-xL disrupts interactions between cytosolic p53 and BCL-xL, releasing the bound p53 to initiate apoptosis. We propose that regulated unfolding of BCL-xL provides a mechanism to promote PUMA-dependent signaling within the apoptotic pathways.",

Fluorescence can be used to localise a molecule, study its binding with interaction partners and ligands, or to follow conformational changes in large multicomponent systems. Efficient labelling of proteins and nucleic acids is very important for any fluorescence method, and equally the development of novel fluorophores has been crucial in making biomolecules amenable to single molecule fluorescence methods. In this paper we review novel coupling strategies that permit site-specific and efficient labelling of proteins. Furthermore, we will discuss progressive single molecule approaches that allow the detection of individual molecules and biomolecular complexes even directly isolated from cellular extracts at much higher and much lower concentrations than has been possible so far.",

One well studied cargo in vivo is the melanosome, a pigment organelle that is moved first by kinesin on microtubules and then handed off to myoVa for transport in the actin-rich dendritic periphery of melanocytes. Melanophilin (Mlph) is the adapter protein that links Rab27a-melanosomes to myoVa. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and quantum dot-labeled full-length myoVa, we show at the single-molecule level that Mlph increases the number of processively moving myoVa motors by 17-fold. Surprisingly, myoVa-Mlph moves ∼4-fold slower than myoVa alone and with twice the run length. These two changes greatly increase the time spent on actin, a property likely to enhance the transfer of melanosomes to the adjacent keratinocyte. In contrast to the variable stepping pattern of full-length myoVa, the myoVa-Mlph complex shows a normal gating pattern between the heads typical of a fully active motor and consistent with a cargo-dependent activation mechanism. The Mlph-dependent changes in myoVa depend on a positively charged cluster of amino acids in the actin binding domain of Mlph, suggesting that Mlph acts as a “tether” that links the motor to the track. Our results provide a molecular explanation for the uncharacteristically slow speed of melanosome movement by myoVa in vivo. More generally, these data show that proteins that link motors to cargo can modify motor properties to enhance their biological role.",Gating;Intracellular Trafficking;Myosin;Nanotechnology;Protein Dynamics;Slac-2a;Melanophilin;Processivity;Regulation;Tethering

Water deficit is one of these adverse conditions caused by drought, salinity, and extreme temperatures. Plants have developed different responses to prevent, ameliorate or repair the damage inflicted by these stressful environments. One of these responses is the activation of a set of genes encoding a group of hydrophilic proteins that typically accumulate to high levels during seed dehydration, at the last stage of embryogenesis, hence named Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) proteins. LEA proteins also accumulate in response to water limitation in vegetative tissues, and have been classified in seven groups based on their amino acid sequence similarity and on the presence of distinctive conserved motifs. These proteins are widely distributed in the plant kingdom, from ferns to angiosperms, suggesting a relevant role in the plant response to this unfavorable environmental condition. In this review, we analyzed the LEA proteins from those legumes whose complete genomes have been sequenced such as Phaseolus vulgaris, Glycine max, Medicago truncatula, Lotus japonicus, Cajanus cajan, and Cicer arietinum. Considering their distinctive motifs, LEA proteins from the different groups were identified, and their sequence analysis allowed the recognition of novel legume specific motifs. Moreover, we compile their transcript accumulation patterns based on publicly available data. In spite of the limited information on these proteins in legumes, the analysis and data compiled here confirm the high correlation between their accumulation and water deficit, reinforcing their functional relevance under this detrimental conditions.",legumes;common bean;soybean;Medicago;LEA proteins;water deficit;abiotic stress

We show here that a specific G1 cyclin transcript is highly clustered in the cytoplasm of large multinucleate cells. This heterogeneous cyclin transcript localization results from aggregation of an RNA-binding protein, and deletion of a polyglutamine stretch in this protein results in random transcript localization. These multinucleate cells are remarkable in that nuclei cycle asynchronously despite sharing a common cytoplasm. Notably, randomization of cyclin transcript localization significantly diminishes nucleus-to-nucleus differences in the number of mRNAs and synchronizes cell-cycle timing. Thus, nonrandom cyclin transcript localization is important for cell-cycle timing control and arises due to polyQ-dependent behavior of an RNA-binding protein. There is a widespread association between polyQ expansions and RNA-binding motifs, suggesting that this is a broadly exploited mechanism to produce spatially variable transcripts and heterogeneous cell behaviors.",

Nevertheless, the spectral resolution for uniformly labeled samples is often compromised by redundancy of the primary sequence and the presence of helical secondary structure that results in substantial resonance overlap. The ability to simplify the spectrum in order to obtain unambiguous site-specific assignments is a major bottleneck for structure determination. To address this problem, we used a combination of 15N reverse labeling and afterglow spectroscopic techniques that dramatically improved the ability to resolve peaks in a crowded spectrum. This was demonstrated using the polytopic membrane protein EmrE, an efflux pump involved in multidrug resistance. Residues preceding the 15N reverse labeled amino acid were imaged using a 3D NCOCX afterglow experiment and those following were recorded using a frequency-selective dephasing experiment. Our approach reduced the spectral congestion and provided a sensitive way to obtain chemical shift assignments for a membrane protein where no high-resolution structure is available. This MAS methodology is widely applicable to the study of other polytopic membrane proteins in functional lipid bilayer environments.",solid-state NMR;assignment methods;magic-angle-spinning;fast data acquisition;sequential acquisition;detection approaches;EmrE;multidrug resistance;membrane proteins;small multidrug resistance

A clear correlation is observed between mutationally induced conformational differences in one of the oligopeptide repeats (R2) in the N terminus of Sup35 and the relative ability to propagate [PSI+]. Strikingly, substitution of one of a Gly-Gly pair with highly charged residues that significantly increase structural definition of R2 lead to a severe [PSI+] propagation defect.

Working toward this goal, our group has previously shown that the nanostructure of bone can be reproduced using a polymer-induced liquid-precursor (PILP) process, which enables intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen with hydroxyapatite (HA) to be achieved. This prior work used polyaspartic acid (pASP), a simple mimic for acidic non-collagenous proteins (NCPs), to generate nanodroplets/nanoparticles of an amorphous mineral precursor which can infiltrate the interstices of type-I collagen fibrils. In this study we show that osteopontin (OPN) can similarly serve as a process-directing agent for the intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen, even though OPN is generally considered a mineralization inhibitor. We also found that inclusion of OPN in the mineralization process promotes the interaction of mouse marrow-derived osteoclasts with PILP-remineralized bone that was previously demineralized, as measured by actin ring formation. While osteoclast activation occurred when pASP was used as the process-directing agent, using OPN resulted in a dramatic effect on osteoclast activation, presumably because of the inherent arginine-glycine-aspartate acid (RGD) ligands of OPN. By capitalizing on the multifunctionality of OPN, these studies may lead the way to producing biomimetic bone substitutes with the capability of tailorable bioresorption rates.",Biomimetic material;biomineralization;bioresorption;bone graft;osteopontin;osteoclast

While important questions remain about the structures of fibrils (and prefibrillar intermediates) formed by specific proteins, existing data for well-studied systems do not contain real contradictions. Where different laboratories have obtained different results for the same protein or peptide, apparent inconsistencies are largely attributable to the highly polymorphic nature of most amyloids, or to differences in the structural information content of various experimental techniques. Future work is likely to focus on the development of detailed structural models for fibrils formed by larger proteins, on further clarification of the specific structural variations that underlie prion strains, and on characterization of the specific structural states that are important in amyloid and prion diseases.",

Here we review the individual cases and genome-wide studies which illustrate the association between missense mutations and diseases. In addition we emphasize that the molecular mechanisms of effects of mutations should be revealed in order to understand the disease origin. Finally we report the current state-of-the-art methodologies which predict the effects of mutations on protein stability, the hydrogen bond network, pH-dependence, conformational dynamics and protein function.",Genetic variation;single nucleotide polymorphism;SNP;rare mutations;diseases

However, mutant transcripts containing expanded CAG repeats may also be toxic and contribute to cellular dysfunction. The exact nature and importance of RNA toxicity in polyQ diseases are only beginning to be recognized, and the first insights have mainly resulted from studies using simple model systems. In this review, we briefly present the basic mechanisms of protein toxicity in polyQ disorders and RNA toxicity in myotonic dystrophy type 1 and discuss recent results suggesting that the pathogenesis of polyQ diseases may also be mediated by mutant transcripts. This review is focused on the experimental systems used thus far to demonstrate RNA toxicity in polyQ disorders and the design of new systems that will be more relevant to the human disease situation and capable of separating RNA toxicity from protein toxicity.",Polyglutamine disorders;Triplet repeats;Toxic RNA;Neurodegenerative diseases

An allosteric Ca2+ sensor (Ca3–Ca4 sites) is located on CBD1, whereas CBD2 contains a splice-variant segment. Recently, a Ca2+-driven interdomain switch has been described, albeit how it couples Ca2+ binding with signal propagation remains unclear. To resolve the dynamic features of Ca2+-induced conformational transitions we analyze here distinct splice variants and mutants of isolated CBD12 at varying temperatures by using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and equilibrium 45Ca2+ binding assays. The ensemble optimization method SAXS analysis demonstrates that the apo and Mg2+-bound forms of CBD12 are highly flexible, whereas Ca2+ binding to the Ca3–Ca4 sites results in a population shift of conformational landscape to more rigidified states. Population shift occurs even under conditions in which no effect of Ca2+ is observed on the globally derived Dmax (maximal interatomic distance), although under comparable conditions a normal [Ca2+]-dependent allosteric regulation occurs. Low affinity sites (Ca1–Ca2) of CBD1 do not contribute to Ca2+-induced population shift, but the occupancy of these sites by 1 mm Mg2+ shifts the Ca2+ affinity (Kd) at the neighboring Ca3–Ca4 sites from ∼ 50 nm to ∼ 200 nm and thus, keeps the primary Ca2+ sensor (Ca3–Ca4 sites) within a physiological range. Thus, Ca2+ binding to the Ca3–Ca4 sites results in a population shift, where more constraint conformational states become highly populated at dynamic equilibrium in the absence of global conformational transitions in CBD alignment.",Allosteric Regulation;Calcium;Calcium-binding Proteins;Protein Conformation;Sodium-Calcium Exchange;Population Shift

Experimental and computational studies have examined the structural basis and the nucleation of short fibrils, but the ability to predict and precisely quantify the stability of larger aggregates has remained elusive. We established a complete classification of fibril shapes and developed a tool called CreateFibril to build such complex, polymorphic, modular structures automatically. We applied stability landscapes, a technique we developed to reveal reliable fibril structural parameters, to assess fibril stability. CreateFibril constructed HET-s, Aβ, and amylin fibrils up to 17 nm in length, and utilized a novel dipolar solvent model that captured the effect of dipole-dipole interactions between water and very large molecular systems to assess their aqueous stability. Our results validate experimental data for HET-s and Aβ, and suggest novel (to our knowledge) findings for amylin. In particular, we predicted the correct structural parameters (rotation angles, packing distances, hydrogen bond lengths, and helical pitches) for the one and three predominant HET-s protofilaments. We reveal and structurally characterize all known Aβ polymorphic fibrils, including structures recently classified as wrapped fibrils. Finally, we elucidate the predominant amylin fibrils and assert that native amylin is more stable than its amyloid form. CreateFibril and a database of all stable polymorphic fibril models we tested, along with their structural energy landscapes, are available at http://amyloid.cs.mcgill.ca.",

Two different crystal structures of OmpG obtained at different values of pH suggest a pH-gated pore opening mechanism. In these structures, extracellular loop 6 extends away from the barrel wall at neutral pH, but is folded back into the pore lumen at low pH, blocking transport through the pore. Loop 6 was invisible in a previously published solution NMR structure of OmpG in DPC micelles, presumably due to conformational exchange on an intermediate NMR time-scale. Here we present an NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE)-based approach to visualize the conformational dynamics of loop 6 and to calculate conformational ensembles that explain the pH-gated opening and closing of the OmpG channel. The different loop conformers detected by the PRE ensemble calculations were validated by disulfide cross-linking of strategically engineered cysteines and electrophysiological single channel recordings. The results indicate a more dynamically regulated channel opening and closing than previously thought and reveal additional membrane-associated conformational ensembles at pH 6.3 and 7.0. We anticipate this approach to be generally applicable to detect and characterize functionally important conformational ensembles of membrane proteins.",

Sections 2 and 3 are designed to be an introduction to water as a participant, discussing the nature of interactions between water and ions, the relative energies involved, and what it means for ions and macromolecules to exist in an aqueous environment. Section 4 is designed to explain how Figure 1 is possible. Section 4 explains the first two pathways in Figure 1, gives a brief overview of both the kinetic, and the thermodynamic considerations of crystallization, and introduces the concept of what has been described, by some, as the dense liquid phase. In section 5 we explain the likely make up of the dense liquid phase and the mechanism by which water likely plays a critical role in the structure and regulation of the dense liquid phase. Section 6 explains the various pathways to crystallization seen in Figure 1 through the lens of bound water and the dynamics of changing hydration layers. We do this by correlating the data found in selected works, and tie the experimental results of those works to the unifying mechanism of regulating the formation and removal of bound water. Section 7 then brings together our understanding of the behavior of water, crystal formation, and Figure 1, to address the mineralization of collagen with and without the aide of polyelectrolytes.",

PrLDs in RNA-binding proteins are essential for the assembly of ribonucleoprotein granules. However, the interplay between human PrLD function and disease is not understood. Here, we define pathogenic mutations in PrLDs of hnRNPA2/B1 and hnRNPA1 in families with inherited degeneration affecting muscle, brain, motor neuron and bone, and a case of familial ALS. Wild-type hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 display an intrinsic tendency to assemble into self-seeding fibrils, which is exacerbated by the disease mutations. Indeed, the pathogenic mutations strengthen a ‘steric zipper’ motif in the PrLD, which accelerates formation of self-seeding fibrils that cross-seed polymerization of wild-type hnRNP. Importantly, the disease mutations promote excess incorporation of hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 into stress granules and drive the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions in animal models that recapitulate the human pathology. Thus, dysregulated polymerization caused by a potent mutant ‘steric zipper’ motif in a PrLD can initiate degenerative disease. Related proteins with PrLDs must be considered candidates for initiating and perhaps propagating proteinopathies of muscle, brain, motor neuron and bone.",

How Hsp104 and ClpB coordinate polypeptide handover with Hsp70 is not understood. Here, we define conserved distal loop residues between middle domain (MD) helix 1 and 2 that are unexpectedly critical for Hsp104 and ClpB collaboration with Hsp70. Surprisingly, the Hsp104 and ClpB MD distal loop does not contact Hsp70 but makes intrasubunit contacts with nucleotide-binding domain 2 (NBD2). Thus, the MD does not invariably project out into solution as in one structural model of Hsp104 and ClpB hexamers. These intrasubunit contacts as well as those between MD helix 2 and NBD1 are different in Hsp104 and ClpB. NBD2-MD contacts dampen disaggregase activity and must separate for protein disaggregation. We demonstrate that ClpB requires DnaK more stringently than Hsp104 requires Hsp70 for protein disaggregation.

Similarly to eukaryotes, proteasomes play a central role in protein degradation and can be essential in Archaea. Core particles associate with and utilize a variety of ATPase complexes to carry out protein degradation in Archaea. In actinobacterial species, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, proteasome-mediated degradation is associated with pathogenesis and does not appear to be essential. Interestingly, both actinobacterial species and Archaea use small proteins to covalently modify proteins, prokaryotic ubiquitin-like proteins (Pup) in Actinobacteria and ubiquitin-like small archaeal modifier proteins (SAMP) in Archaea.

However, studies in filamentous fungi have revealed that peroxisomes have diverse functional repertoires. This review describes the essential roles of peroxisomes in the growth and survival processes of filamentous fungi. One such survival mechanism involves the Woronin body, a Pezizomycotina-specific organelle that plugs the septal pore upon hyphal lysis to prevent excessive cytoplasmic loss. A number of reports have demonstrated that Woronin bodies are derived from peroxisomes. Specifically, the Woronin body protein Hex1 is targeted to peroxisomes by peroxisomal targeting sequence 1 (PTS1) and forms a self-assembled structure that buds from peroxisomes to form the Woronin body. Peroxisomal deficiency reduces the ability of filamentous fungi to prevent excessive cytoplasmic loss upon hyphal lysis, indicating that peroxisomes contribute to the survival of these multicellular organisms. Peroxisomes were also recently found to play a vital role in the biosynthesis of biotin, which is an essential cofactor for various carboxylation and decarboxylation reactions. In biotin-prototrophic fungi, peroxisome-deficient mutants exhibit growth defects when grown on glucose as a carbon source due to biotin auxotrophy. The biotin biosynthetic enzyme BioF (7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid synthase) contains a PTS1 motif that is required for both peroxisomal targeting and biotin biosynthesis. In plants, the BioF protein contains a conserved PTS1 motif and is also localized in peroxisomes. These findings indicate that the involvement of peroxisomes in biotin biosynthesis is evolutionarily conserved between fungi and plants, and that peroxisomes play a key role in fungal growth.",peroxisome;fungi;Woronin body;biotin;mitochondria

RIG-I detects and binds to foreign duplex RNA in the cytoplasm of both immune and non-immune cells, and initiates the induction of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The mechanism of RIG-I activation by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) involves a molecular rearrangement proposed to expose the N-terminal pair of caspase activation recruitment domains, enabling an interaction with interferon-beta promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1) and thereby initiating downstream signalling. dsRNA is particularly stimulatory when longer than 20 bp, potentially through allowing binding of more than one RIG-I molecule. Here, we characterize full-length RIG-I and RIG-I subdomains combined with a stimulatory 29mer dsRNA using multi-angle light scattering and size-exclusion chromatography–coupled small-angle X-ray scattering, to build up a molecular model of RIG-I before and after the formation of a 2:1 protein:dsRNA assembly. We report the small-angle X-ray scattering–derived solution structure of the human apo-RIG-I and observe that on binding of RIG-I to dsRNA in a 2:1 ratio, the complex becomes highly extended and flexible. Hence, here we present the first model of the fully activated oligomeric RIG-I.",

Wright: ude.sppircs@thgirw ","Relaxation dispersion spectroscopy is one of the most widely used techniques for the analysis of protein dynamics. To obtain a detailed understanding of the protein function from the view point of dynamics, it is essential to fit relaxation dispersion data accurately. The grid search method is commonly used for relaxation dispersion curve fits, but it does not always find the global minimum that provides the best-fit parameter set. Also, the fitting quality does not always improve with increase of the grid size although the computational time becomes longer. This is because relaxation dispersion curve fitting suffers from a local minimum problem, which is a general problem in non-linear least squares curve fitting. Therefore, in order to fit relaxation dispersion data rapidly and accurately, we developed a new fitting program called GLOVE that minimizes global and local parameters alternately, and incorporates a Monte-Carlo minimization method that enables fitting parameters to pass through local minima with low computational cost. GLOVE also implements a random search method, which sets up initial parameter values randomly within user-defined ranges. We demonstrate here that the combined use of the three methods can find the global minimum more rapidly and more accurately than grid search alone.",Relaxation dispersion curve fitting;Fitting software;Speed and accuracy;Global fit;Monte Carlo-minimization;Local minimum problem

One fundamental question is how these friction effects depend on the local environment and in particular on the presence of water. In this model study, we use fully atomistic MD simulations with explicit water to obtain friction forces as a single polyglycine peptide chain is pulled out of a bundle of k adhering parallel polyglycine peptide chains. The whole system is periodically replicated along the peptide axes, so a stationary state at prescribed mean sliding velocity V is achieved. The aggregation number is varied between k = 2 (two peptide chains adhering to each other with plenty of water present at the adhesion sites) and k = 7 (one peptide chain pulled out from a close-packed cylindrical array of six neighboring peptide chains with no water inside the bundle). The friction coefficient per hydrogen bond, extrapolated to the viscous limit of vanishing pulling velocity V → 0, exhibits an increase by five orders of magnitude when going from k = 2 to k = 7. This dramatic confinement-induced friction enhancement we argue to be due to a combination of water depletion and increased hydrogen-bond cooperativity.",

Small Angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) can be a useful tool for obtaining structural information of these systems. All-atom modeling of glycoproteins with flexible glycan chains was applied to interpret the solution SAXS data for a set of glycoproteins. For simpler systems (single glycan, with a well defined protein structure), all-atom modeling generates models in excellent agreement with the scattering pattern, and reveals the approximate spatial occupancy of the glycan chain in solution. For more complex systems (several glycan chains, or unknown protein substructure), the approach can still provide insightful models, though the orientations of glycans become poorly determined. Ab initio shape reconstructions appear to capture the global morphology of glycoproteins, but in most cases offer little information about glycan spatial occupancy.

Though molecular pathogenic mechanisms are ill-defined, mounting evidence connects its amyloid forming and membrane binding propensities to disease etiology. Contrary to recent data suggesting that membrane remodeling by α-syn involves anionic phospholipids and helical structure, we discovered that the protein deforms vesicles with no net surface charge (phosphatidylcholine, PC) into tubules (average diameter ~ 20 nm). No discernible secondary structural changes were detected by circular dichroism spectroscopy upon the addition of vesicles. Notably, membrane remodeling inhibits α-syn amyloid formation affecting both lag and growth phases. Using five single-tryptophan variants and time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements, we determined that α-syn influences bilayer structure with surprisingly weak interaction and no site specificity (partition constant, Kp ~ 300 M−1). Vesicle deformation by α-syn under a variety of different lipid/protein conditions is characterized via transmission electron microscopy. As cellular membranes are enriched in PC lipids, these results support possible biological consequences for α-syn induced membrane remodeling related to both function and pathogenesis.",

In order to survive desiccation cycles and utilize short periods of activity during infrequent precipitation, crust microorganisms must rely on the unique capabilities of vegetative cells to enter a dormant state and be poised for rapid resuscitation upon wetting. To elucidate the key events involved in the exit from dormancy, we performed a wetting experiment of a BSC and followed the response of the dominant cyanobacterium, Microcoleus vaginatus, in situ using a whole-genome transcriptional time course that included two diel cycles. Immediate, but transient, induction of DNA repair and regulatory genes signaled the hydration event. Recovery of photosynthesis occurred within 1 h, accompanied by upregulation of anabolic pathways. Onset of desiccation was characterized by the induction of genes for oxidative and photo-oxidative stress responses, osmotic stress response and the synthesis of C and N storage polymers. Early expression of genes for the production of exopolysaccharides, additional storage molecules and genes for membrane unsaturation occurred before drying and hints at preparedness for desiccation. We also observed signatures of preparation for future precipitation, notably the expression of genes for anaplerotic reactions in drying crusts, and the stable maintenance of mRNA through dormancy. These data shed light on possible synchronization between this cyanobacterium and its environment, and provides key mechanistic insights into its metabolism in situ that may be used to predict its response to climate, and or, land-use driven perturbations.",biological soil crust;desiccation survival;dormancy;Microcoleus vaginatus;pulsed-activity event;resuscitation

These devastating disorders include Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Over 15 degenerative diseases are associated with the aggregation of misfolded proteins specifically in the nucleus of cells. But, how the cell safeguards the nucleus from misfolded proteins is not entirely clear. In this review, we discuss what is currently known about the cellular mechanisms that maintain protein homeostasis in the nucleus and protect the nucleus from misfolded protein accumulation and aggregation. In particular, we focus on the chaperones found to localize to the nucleus during stress, the ubiquitin-proteasome components enriched in the nucleus, the signaling systems that might be present in the nucleus to coordinate folding and degradation, and the sites of misfolded protein deposition associated with the nucleus.",Nucleus;chaperone;ubiquitin-protein ligase;ubiquitin;proteasome;unfolded protein response;misfolded protein;aggregation;inclusion;aggresome;JUNQ

The middle and C-terminal regions of Atg13 are intrinsically disordered and rich in regulatory phosphorylation sites. Thus far, there have been no structural data for any part of Atg13, and no function assigned to its N-terminal domain. We crystallized this domain, and found that it has a HORMA (Hop1, Rev7, Mad2) fold. We showed that the Atg13 HORMA domain is required for autophagy and for recruitment of the phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase subunit Atg14, but is not required for Atg1 interaction or Atg13 recruitment to the PAS. The HORMA domain of Atg13 is similar to the closed conformation of the spindle checkpoint protein Mad2. A pair of conserved arginines was identified in the structure, and tested functionally in yeast. These residues are important for autophagy, as mutations abrogate autophagy and block Atg14 recruitment. The location of these Arg residues in the structure suggests that the Atg13 HORMA domain could act as a phosphorylation-dependent conformational switch.",Atg13;HORMA;Atg14;protein structure;protein crystallography;yeast genetics;protein degradation

In plant species that employ the so-called active symplasmic loading strategy, sucrose that diffuses into their unique intermediary cells (ICs) is converted into sugar oligomers. According to the prevalent hypothesis, the oligomers are too large to pass back through PD on the bundle sheath side, but can pass on into the sieve element to be transported in the phloem. Here, we investigate if the PD at the bundle sheath-IC interface can indeed fulfill the function of blocking transport of sugar oligomers while still enabling efficient diffusion of sucrose. Hindrance factors are derived via theoretical modeling for different PD substructure configurations: sub-nano channels, slit, and hydrogel. The results suggest that a strong discrimination could only be realized when the PD opening is almost as small as the sugar oligomers. In order to find model parameters that match the in vivo situation, we measured the effective diffusion coefficient across the interface in question in Cucurbita pepo with 3D-photoactivation microscopy. Calculations indicate that a PD substructure of several sub-nano channels with a radius around 7 Å, a 10.4 Å-wide slit or a hydrogel with 49% polymer fraction would be compatible with the effective diffusion coefficient. If these configurations can accommodate sufficient flux of sucrose into the IC, while blocking raffinose and stachyose movement was assessed using literature data. While the slit-configuration would efficiently prevent the sugar oligomers from “leaking” from the IC, none of the configurations could enable a diffusion-driven sucrose flux that matches the reported rates at a physiologically relevant concentration potential. The presented data provides a first insight on how the substructure of PD could enable selective transport, but indicates that additional factors are involved in efficient phloem loading in active symplasmic loading species.",phloem loading;plasmodesmata;polymer trap;hindered diffusion;carbon allocation

At present, it remains unclear whether the Hfx. volcanii modifier protein SAMP1 has such polyubiquitinating-like activity. Although SAMP1 and SAMP2 use the same conjugation machinery to modify their target proteins, each can impart distinct functional consequences. To better understand the mechanism of SAMP2 conjugation, we have sought to characterize the biophysical and structural properties of the protein from Hfx. volcanii. SAMP2 is only partially structured under mesohalic solution conditions and adopts a well-folded compact conformation in the presence of 2.5M of NaCl. Its 2.3-Å-resolution crystal structure reveals a characteristic α/β central core domain and a unique β-hinge motif. This motif anchors an unusual C-terminal extension comprising the diglycine tail as well as two lysine residues that can potentially serve to interlink SAMP2 moieties. Mutational alternation of the structural malleability of this β-hinge motif essentially abolishes the conjugation activity of SAMP2 in vivo. In addition, NMR structural studies of the putative ubiquitin-like protein HVO_2177 from Hfx. volcanii show that like SAMP1, HVO_2177 forms a classic β-grasp fold in a salt-independent manner. These results provide insights into the structure–function relationship of sampylating proteins of fundamental importance in post-translational protein modification and environmental cues in Archaea.",archaea;ubiquitin-like proteins;protein conjugation;sulfur transfer

However, the intrinsic flexibility of these peptides has frustrated efforts to investigate the secondary and tertiary structure of Aβ monomers, whose conformational landscapes directly contribute to the kinetics and thermodynamics of Aβ aggregation. In this work, de novo replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations on the μs/replica timescale are used to characterize the structural ensembles of Aβ42, Aβ40, and M35-oxidized Aβ42, three physiologically relevant isoforms with substantially different aggregation properties. J-coupling data calculated from the REMD trajectories were compared to corresponding NMR-derived values acquired through two different pulse sequences, revealing that all simulations converge on the order of hundreds of ns/replica toward ensembles that yield good agreement with experiment. Though all three Aβ species adopt highly heterogeneous ensembles, these are considerably more structured compared to simulations on shorter timescales. Prominent in the C-terminus are antiparallel β-hairpins between L17-A21, A30-L36, and V39-I41, similar to oligomer and fibril intrapeptide models, that expose these hydrophobic side chains to solvent and may serve as hotspots for self-association. Compared to reduced Aβ42, the absence of a second β-hairpin in Aβ40 and the sampling of alternate β topologies by M35-oxidized Aβ42 may explain the reduced aggregation rates of these forms. A persistent V24-K28 bend motif, observed in all three species, is stabilized by buried backbone to side chain hydrogen bonds with D23 and a cross-region salt bridge between E22 and K28, highlighting the role of the familial AD-linked E22 and D23 residues in Aβ monomer folding. These characterizations help illustrate the conformational landscapes of Aβ monomers at atomic resolution and provide insight into the early stages of Aβ aggregation pathways.",

This paper focuses on a small aggregating fragment of tau, 273GKVQIINKKLDL284, encompassing the (PHF6*) region that plays a central role in tau aggregation. Using a combination of simulations and experiments, we probe the self-assembly of this peptide, with an emphasis on characterizing the early steps of aggregation. Ion-mobility mass spectrometry experiments provide a size distribution of early oligomers, TEM studies provide a time course of aggregation, and enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations provide atomistically detailed structural information about this intrinsically disordered peptide. Our studies indicate that a point mutation, as well the addition of heparin, lead to a shift in the conformations populated by the earliest oligomers, affecting the kinetics of subsequent fibril formation as well as the morphology of the resulting aggregates. In particular, a mutant associated with a K280 deletion (a mutation that causes a heritable form of neurodegeneration/dementia in the context of full length tau) is seen to aggregate more readily than its wild-type counterpart. Simulations and experiment reveal that the ΔK280 mutant peptide adopts extended conformations to a greater extent than the wild-type peptide, facilitating aggregation through the pre-structuring of the peptide into a fibril-competent structure.",

protein
that is water-soluble but also can bind negatively charged lipid membranes

is increased by post-translational N-terminal acetylation, a common
modification in all eukaryotic cells. In the presence of lipid vesicles
containing a small fraction of peroxidized lipids, the N-terminal
Met residues in αS (Met1 and Met5) rapidly oxidize while reducing
the toxic lipid hydroperoxide to a nonreactive lipid hydroxide, whereas
C-terminal Met residues remain unaffected. Met oxidation can be probed
conveniently and quantitatively by NMR spectroscopy. The results show
that oxidation of Met1 reduces the rate of oxidation of Met5 and vice
versa as a result of decreased membrane affinity of the partially
oxidized protein. The effect of Met oxidation on the αS–membrane
affinity extends over large distances, as in the V49M mutant, oxidation
of Met1 and Met5 strongly impacts the oxidation rate of Met49 and
vice versa. When not bound to membrane, oxidized Met1 and Met5 of

The OB-domain retains its 3D structure in the monomer, and the C-peptide is shown by nuclear Overhauser effects and lanthanide-induced pseudocontact shifts to bind to the OB-domain at a site that harbors ssDNA in the crystal structure of the SSB–ssDNA complex. 15N relaxation data demonstrate high flexibility of the polypeptide segment linking the C-peptide to the OB-domain and somewhat increased flexibility of the C-peptide compared with the OB-domain, suggesting that the C-peptide either retains high mobility in the bound state or is in a fast equilibrium with an unbound state.",

Both human and mouse noroviruses persistently replicate and are shed in stool, a highly effective strategy for spreading between hosts. For mouse norovirus (MNV), the presence of a glutamate rather than an aspartate at position 94 of the NS1/2 protein was previously shown to be essential for persistent replication and shedding. Here, we analyze these critical sequences of NS1/2 at the structural level. Using solution NMR methods we determined folded NS1/2 domain structures from a nonpersistent murine norovirus strain CW3, a persistent strain CR6, and a persistent mutant strain CW3D94E. We found an unstructured PEST-like domain followed by a novel folded domain in the N-terminus of NS1/2. All three forms of the domain are stable and monomeric in solution. Residue 94, critical for determining persistence, is located in a reverse turn following an α-helix in the folded domain. The longer sidechain of glutamate, but not aspartate, allows interaction with the indole group of the nearby tryptophan, reshaping the surface of the domain. The discrimination between glutamyl and aspartyl residue is imposed by the stable tertiary conformation. These structural requirements correlate with the in vivo function of NS1/2 in persistence, a key element of norovirus biology and infection.",polyprotein;MNV;protein NMR;sidechain rotamers;PEST motif;helix-strand-helix

Here we suggest that conformational selection takes place not once in a given binding/allosteric event, but at every step along the allosteric pathway. This view generalizes conformational selection and makes it applicable also to other allosteric events, such as post-translational modifications (PTMs) and photon absorption. Similar to binding, at each step along a propagation pathway, conformational selection is coupled with induced fit which optimizes the interactions. Thus, as in binding, the allosteric effects induced by PTMs and light relate not only to population shift; but to conformational selection as well.

We investigated the mechanistic basis of differences in the osmotolerance of two P. syringae strains, B728a and DC3000. Consistent with its higher survival rates following inoculation onto leaves, B728a exhibited superior osmotolerance over DC3000 and higher rates of uptake of plant-derived osmoprotective compounds. A global transcriptome analysis of B728a and DC3000 following an osmotic upshift demonstrated markedly distinct responses between the strains; B728a showed primarily upregulation of genes, including components of the type VI secretion system (T6SS) and alginate biosynthetic pathways, whereas DC3000 showed no change or repression of orthologous genes, including downregulation of the T3SS. DC3000 uniquely exhibited improved growth upon deletion of the biosynthetic genes for the compatible solute N-acetylglutaminylglutamine amide (NAGGN) in a minimal medium, due possibly to NAGGN synthesis depleting the cellular glutamine pool. Both strains showed osmoreduction of glnA1 expression, suggesting that decreased glutamine synthetase activity contributes to glutamate accumulation as a compatible solute, and both strains showed osmoinduction of 5 of 12 predicted hydrophilins. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the superior epiphytic competence of B728a is consistent with its strong osmotolerance, a proactive response to an osmotic upshift, osmoinduction of alginate synthesis and the T6SS, and resiliency of the T3SS to water limitation, suggesting sustained T3SS expression under the water-limited conditions encountered during leaf colonization.",

While extensive structural information is known about the transmembrane helix and an adjacent amphipathic helix, the conformation of the N-terminal ectodomain and the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail remains largely unknown. Using two-dimensional (2D) magic-angle-spinning solid-state NMR, we have investigated the secondary structure and dynamics of full-length M2 (M2FL) and found them to depend on the membrane composition. In 2D 13C DARR correlation spectra, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC)-bound M2FL exhibits several peaks at β-sheet chemical shifts, which result from water-exposed extramembrane residues. In contrast, M2FL bound to cholesterol-containing membranes gives predominantly α-helical chemical shifts. Two-dimensional J-INADEQUATE spectra and variable-temperature 13C spectra indicate that DMPC-bound M2FL is highly dynamic while the cholesterol-containing membranes significantly immobilize the protein at physiological temperature. Chemical-shift prediction for various secondary-structure models suggests that the β-strand is located at the N-terminus of the DMPC-bound protein, while the cytoplasmic domain is unstructured. This prediction is confirmed by the 2D DARR spectrum of the ectodomain-truncated M2(21–97), which no longer exhibits β-sheet chemical shifts in the DMPC-bound state. We propose that the M2 conformational change results from the influence of cholesterol, and the increased helicity of M2FL in cholesterol-rich membranes may be relevant for M2 interaction with the matrix protein M1 during virus assembly and budding. The successful determination of the β-strand location suggests that chemical-shift prediction is a promising approach for obtaining structural information of disordered proteins before resonance assignment.",membrane protein;influenza M2;chemical shift prediction;conformational change

Ligands of CCR5, including chemokines and chemokine analogs, are capable of blocking HIV entry, and studies of their structures and interactions with CCR5 will be key to understanding and optimizing HIV inhibition. The RANTES derivative 5P12-RANTES is a highly potent HIV entry inhibitor that is being developed as a topical HIV prevention agent (microbicide). We have characterized the structure and dynamics of 5P12-RANTES by solution NMR. With the exception of the nine flexible N-terminal residues, 5P12-RANTES has the same structure as wild-type RANTES but unlike the wild-type, does not dimerize via its N-terminus. To prepare the ground for interaction studies with detergent-solubilized CCR5, we have also investigated the interaction of RANTES and 5P12-RANTES with various commonly used detergents. Both RANTES variants are stable in Cymal-5, DHPC, Anzergent-3-12, dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride, and a DDM/CHAPS/CHS mixture. Fos-Cholines, dodecyldimethylglycine, and sodium dodecyl-sulfate denature both RANTES variants at low pH, whereas at neutral pH the stability is considerably higher. The onset of Fos-Choline-12-induced denaturation and the denatured state were characterized by circular dichroism and NMR. The detergent interaction starts below the critical micelle concentration at a well-defined mixed hydrophobic/positive surface region of the chemokine, which overlaps with the dimer interface. An increase of Fos-Choline-12 concentration above the critical micelle concentration causes a transition to a denatured state with a high α-helical content.",

A subset of nucleoporins bear a domain with multiple phenylalanine–glycine (FG) motifs. As binding sites for transport receptors, FG Nups are critical in translocation through the NPC. Certain FG Nups are believed to associate via low-affinity, cohesive interactions to form the permeability barrier of the pore, although the form and composition of this functional barrier are debated. We used green fluorescent protein–Nup98/HoxA9 constructs with various numbers of repeats and also substituted FG domains from other nucleoporins for the Nup98 domain to directly compare cohesive interactions in live cells by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). We find that cohesion is a function of both number and type of FG repeats. Glycine–leucine–FG (GLFG) repeat domains are the most cohesive. FG domains from several human nucleoporins showed no interactions in this assay; however, Nup214, with numerous VFG motifs, displayed measurable cohesion by FRAP. The cohesive nature of a human nucleoporin did not necessarily correlate with that of its yeast orthologue. The Nup98 GLFG domain also functions in pore targeting through binding to Nup93, positioning the GLFG domain in the center of the NPC and supporting a role for this nucleoporin in the permeability barrier.",

To properly navigate this ever-altering membrane labyrinth, transmembrane protein cargoes typically require specific sorting signals that are decoded by components of protein coats. The best-characterized sorting process within the endosomal system is the rapid internalization of select transmembrane proteins within clathrin-coated vesicles. Endocytic signals consist of linear motifs, conformational determinants, or covalent modifications in the cytosolic domains of transmembrane cargo. These signals are interpreted by a diverse set of clathrin-associated sorting proteins (CLASPs) that translocate from the cytosol to the inner face of the plasma membrane. Signal recognition by CLASPs is highly cooperative, involving additional interactions with phospholipids, Arf GTPases, other CLASPs, and clathrin, and is regulated by large conformational changes and covalent modifications. Related sorting events occur at other endosomal sorting stations.",

This highlights the importance of using models that are informed by the molecular biology, biochemistry, and biophysics of the evolving systems. We describe a computational model based on fundamental aspects of biophysics, the requirement for (most) proteins to be thermodynamically stable. Using this model, we find that differences in population size have minimal impact on the distribution of population-scaled fitness effects, as well as on the rate of molecular evolution. This is because larger populations result in selection for more stable proteins that are less affected by mutations. This reduction in the magnitude of the fitness effects almost exactly cancels the greater selective pressure resulting from the larger population size. Conversely, changes in the population size in either direction cause transient increases in the substitution rate. As differences in population size often correspond to changes in population size, this makes comparisons of substitution rates in different lineages difficult to interpret.",nearly neutral theory;effective population size;substitution rate;protein stability;epistasis;population bottleneck

Due to relative stability of the initial oligomers of stefin B, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS) could be applied in addition to size exclusion chromatography (SEC). These two techniques enabled us to separate and detect distinguished oligomers from the monomers: dimers, trimers, tetramers, up to decamers. The amyloid fibril formation process was followed at different pH and temperatures, including such conditions where the process was slow enough to detect the initial oligomeric species at the very beginning of the lag phase and those at the end of the lag phase.

Deciphering the molecular mechanism of pH-dependent refolding and membrane insertion of the T-domain, which is considered to be a paradigm for cell entry of other bacterial toxins, reveals general physicochemical principles underlying membrane protein assembly and signaling on membrane interfaces. Structure-function studies along the T-domain insertion pathway have been affected by the presence of multiple conformations at the same time, which hinders the application of high-resolution structural techniques. Here, we review recent progress in structural, functional and thermodynamic studies of the T-domain archived using a combination of site-selective fluorescence labeling with an array of spectroscopic techniques and computer simulations. We also discuss the principles of conformational switching along the insertion pathway revealed by studies of a series of T-domain mutants with substitutions of histidine residues.",acid-induced conformational change;membrane protein insertion;histidine protonation;fluorescence;molecular dynamics;conformational switch

To date, however, the quantitative studies of dynamics of single-stranded nucleic acids have been limited. Thus motivated, here we investigate the sequence composition, chain-length, viscosity, and temperature dependencies of the end-to-end collision dynamics of single-stranded DNAs. We find that both the absolute collision rate and the temperature dependencies of these dynamics are base-composition dependent, suggesting that base stacking interactions are a significant contributor. For example, whereas the end-to-end collision dynamics of poly-thymine exhibit simple, linear Arrhenius behavior, the behavior of longer poly-adenine constructs is more complicated. Specifically, 20- and 25-adenine constructs exhibit biphasic temperature dependencies, with their temperature dependences becoming effectively indistinguishable from that of poly-thymine above 335 K for 20-adenines and 328 K for 25-adenines. The differing Arrhenius behaviors of poly-thymine and poly-adenine and the chain-length dependence of the temperature at which poly-adenine crosses over to behave like poly-thymine can be explained by a barrier friction mechanism in which, at low temperatures, the energy barrier for the local rearrangement of poly-adenine becomes the dominant contributor to its end-to-end collision dynamics.",

Due to recent improvements in data analysis, the accuracy of experimental SV data emerges as a limiting factor in its interpretation. Our goal was to unravel the sources of experimental error and develop improved calibration procedures. We implemented the use of a Thermochron iButton® temperature logger to directly measure the temperature of a spinning rotor, and detected deviations that can translate into an error of as much as 10% in the sedimentation coefficient. We further designed a precision mask with equidistant markers to correct for instrumental errors in the radial calibration, which were observed to span a range of 8.6%. The need for an independent time calibration emerged with use of the current data acquisition software (Zhao et al., doi 10.1016/j.ab.2013.02.011) and we now show that smaller but significant time errors of up to 2% also occur with earlier versions. After application of these calibration corrections, the sedimentation coefficients obtained from eleven instruments displayed a significantly reduced standard deviation of ∼ 0.7 %.

A highly relevant biological example of such a phenomenon is the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) found perforating the nuclear envelope of eukaryotic cells. In the central conduit of the NPC, of ∼30–60 nm diameter, a disordered network of proteins regulates all macromolecular transport between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In spite of a wealth of experimental data, the selectivity barrier of the NPC has yet to be explained fully. Experimental and theoretical approaches are complicated by the disordered and heterogeneous nature of the NPC conduit. Modelling approaches have focused on the behaviour of the partially unfolded protein domains in the confined geometry of the NPC conduit, and have demonstrated that within the range of parameters thought relevant for the NPC, widely varying behaviour can be observed. In this review, we summarise recent efforts to physically model the NPC barrier and function. We illustrate how attempts to understand NPC barrier function have employed many different modelling techniques, each of which have contributed to our understanding of the NPC.",

In the present work, we study a high concentrated collagen sample in its soluble, fibrillar, and denatured states using one and two dimensional {1H}-13C solid-state NMR spectroscopy. We interpret 13C chemical shift variations in terms of dihedral angle conformation changes. Our data show that fibrillogenesis increases the side chain and backbone structural complexity. Nevertheless, only three to five rotameric equilibria are found for each amino acid residue, indicating a relatively low structural heterogeneity of collagen upon fibrillogenesis. Using side chain statistical data, we calculate equilibrium constants for a great number of amino acid residues. Moreover, based on a 13C quantitative spectrum, we estimate the percentage of residues implicated in each equilibrium. Our data indicate that fibril formation greatly affects hydroxyproline and proline prolyl pucker ring conformation. Finally, we discuss the implication of these structural data and propose a model in which the attractive force of fibrillogenesis comes from a structural reorganization of 10 to 15% of the amino acids.

In vitro experiments showed that Mfn2 overexpression suppressed gastric cancer cell proliferation and colony formation, weakened the invasion and migratory ability of cancer cells by downregulating MMP-2 and MMP-9, halted the cell cycle and induced apoptosis.

These modifications are mainly controlled by members of the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin families. Early studies in photosynthetic organisms have identified the Calvin–Benson cycle, the photosynthetic pathway responsible for carbon assimilation, as a redox regulated process. Indeed, 4 out of 11 enzymes of the cycle were shown to have a low activity in the dark and to be activated in the light through thioredoxin-dependent reduction of regulatory disulfide bonds. The underlying molecular mechanisms were extensively studied at the biochemical and structural level. Unexpectedly, recent biochemical and proteomic studies have suggested that all enzymes of the cycle and several associated regulatory proteins may undergo redox regulation through multiple redox post-translational modifications including glutathionylation and nitrosylation. The aim of this review is to detail the well-established mechanisms of redox regulation of Calvin–Benson cycle enzymes as well as the most recent reports indicating that this pathway is tightly controlled by multiple interconnected redox post-translational modifications. This redox control is likely allowing fine tuning of the Calvin–Benson cycle required for adaptation to varying environmental conditions, especially during responses to biotic and abiotic stresses.",Calvin–Benson cycle;CO2 fixation;thioredoxin;glutaredoxin;glutathionylation;nitrosylation;photosynthesis;redox regulation

Moreover, direct binding to cognate mRNAs has been detected for multiple proteins, thus creating a strong impetus to search for functional significance and basic physico-chemical principles behind such interactions. Here, we derive interaction preferences between amino acids and RNA bases by analyzing binding interfaces in the known 3D structures of protein–RNA complexes. By applying this tool to human proteome, we reveal statistically significant matching between the composition of mRNA sequences and base-binding preferences of protein sequences they code for. For example, purine density profiles of mRNA sequences mirror guanine affinity profiles of cognate protein sequences with quantitative accuracy (median Pearson correlation coefficient R = −0.80 across the entire human proteome). Notably, statistically significant anti-matching is seen only in the case of adenine.

However, recent work has established that the C region mediates allosteric changes in the V region that can influence specificity and affinity. To further explore cross-domain interrelationship in murine IgG structure we carried out solution small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements for four V region identical IgG isotypes. SAXS analysis revealed elongated Y-shaped structures in solution with significantly different, isotype-dependent domain orientations. To further explore local C region effects on the V region, the IgG3 Fab crystal structure from the same family was determined to 2.45 Å resolution. The IgG3 Fab crystal structure differs from a closely related previously solved IgG1 Fab revealing significant structural differences, which may account for isotype-related specificity differences in V region identical Abs. Among the four murine isotypes, IgG3 was the most different in solution with regards to overall structure as well as aggregate formation in solution suggesting that the greater apparent affinity of this isotype resulted from polyvalent complexes with enhanced avidity. Our results provide additional evidence that Ig V and C domains influence each other structurally and suggest that V region structure can have significant effects on overall Ig structure.",Immunoglobulin;Isotype;SAXS;X-ray crystallography;Variable domain;Constant domain;Antigen

Mulshine","Autophagy and apoptosis are catabolic pathways essential for organismal homeostasis. Autophagy is normally a cell-survival pathway involving the degradation and recycling of obsolete, damaged, or harmful macromolecular assemblies; however, excess autophagy has been implicated in type II cell death. Apoptosis is the canonical programmed cell death pathway. Autophagy and apoptosis have now been shown to be interconnected by several molecular nodes of crosstalk, enabling the coordinate regulation of degradation by these pathways. Normally, autophagy and apoptosis are both tumor suppressor pathways. Autophagy fulfils this role as it facilitates the degradation of oncogenic molecules, preventing development of cancers, while apoptosis prevents the survival of cancer cells. Consequently, defective or inadequate levels of either autophagy or apoptosis can lead to cancer. However, autophagy appears to have a dual role in cancer, as it has now been shown that autophagy also facilitates the survival of tumor cells in stress conditions such as hypoxic or low-nutrition environments. Here we review the multiple molecular mechanisms of coordination of autophagy and apoptosis and the role of the proteins involved in this crosstalk in cancer. A comprehensive understanding of the interconnectivity of autophagy and apoptosis is essential for the development of effective cancer therapeutics.",

How different PcG proteins assemble into complexes and are recruited to their target genes is poorly understood. Here, we report the crystal structure of the core of the Drosophila PcG protein complex Pleiohomeotic (Pho)-repressive complex (PhoRC), which contains the Polycomb response element (PRE)-binding protein Pho and Sfmbt. The spacer region of Pho, separated from the DNA-binding domain by a long flexible linker, forms a tight complex with the four malignant brain tumor (4MBT) domain of Sfmbt. The highly conserved spacer region of the human Pho ortholog YY1 binds three of the four human 4MBT domain proteins in an analogous manner but with lower affinity. Comparison of the Drosophila Pho:Sfmbt and human YY1:MBTD1 complex structures provides a molecular explanation for the lower affinity of YY1 for human 4MBT domain proteins. Structure-guided mutations that disrupt the interaction between Pho and Sfmbt abolish formation of a ternary Sfmbt:Pho:DNA complex in vitro and repression of developmental regulator genes in Drosophila. PRE tethering of Sfmbt by Pho is therefore essential for Polycomb repression in Drosophila. Our results support a model where DNA tethering of Sfmbt by Pho and multivalent interactions of Sfmbt with histone modifications and other PcG proteins create a hub for PcG protein complex assembly at PREs.",Polycomb;Polycomb response element;PhoRC;Pho;Sfmbt;YY1

This orientational ordering of the FG domains depends on their specific context within the NPC, but is independent of active transport and cargo load. For most nups, behavior does not depend on the FG motifs. These data support a model whereby local geometry constrains the orientational organization of the FG nups.

These interactions were mutually exclusive in vitro corresponding to an antagonistic behavior of MLL-ENL and CBX8 in vivo. CBX8 inhibited elongation in a specific reporter assay and this effect was neutralized by direct association with ENL. Correspondingly MLL-ENL defective in CBX8 binding could not fully activate gene loci necessary for transformation.

For successful molecular replacement the model must cover at least 50% of the total structure and the Cα r.m.s.d. between the core model and the structure to be solved must be less than 2 Å. Here, an approach originally implemented in the CaspR server (http://www.igs.cnrs-mrs.fr/Caspr2/index.cgi) based on homology modelling to search for a molecular-replacement solution is discussed. How the use of as much information as possible from different sources can improve the model(s) is briefly described. The combination of structural information with distantly related sequences is crucial to optimize the multiple alignment that will define the boundaries of the core domains. PDB clusters (sequences with ≥30% identical residues) can also provide information on the eventual changes in conformation and will help to explore the relative orientations assumed by protein subdomains. Normal-mode analysis can also help in generating series of conformational models in the search for a molecular-replacement solution. Of course, finding a correct solution is only the first step and the accuracy of the identified solution is as important as the data quality to proceed through refinement.

These membrane proteins consist of an amino-terminal cytosolic domain involved in protein interactions and a carboxyl-terminal membrane domain that carries out the transport function. Mutation of a conserved arginine residue (R298S) in the cytosolic domain of NBCe1 (SLC4A4) is linked to proximal renal tubular acidosis and results in impaired transport function, suggesting that the cytosolic domain plays a role in substrate permeation. Introduction of single and double mutations at the equivalent arginine (Arg283) and at an interacting glutamate (Glu85) in the cytosolic domain of human AE1 (cdAE1) had no effect on the cell surface expression or the transport activity of AE1 expressed in HEK-293 cells. In addition, the membrane domain of AE1 (mdAE1) efficiently mediated anion transport. A 2.1-Å resolution crystal structure of cdΔ54AE1 (residues 55–356 of cdAE1) lacking the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal disordered regions, produced at physiological pH, revealed an extensive hydrogen-bonded network involving Arg283 and Glu85. Mutations at these residues affected the pH-dependent conformational changes and stability of cdΔ54AE1. As these structural alterations did not impair functional expression of AE1, the cytosolic and membrane domains operate independently. A substrate access tunnel within the cytosolic domain is not present in AE1 and therefore is not an essential feature of the SLC4 family of bicarbonate transporters.",Anion Transport;Membrane Proteins;Protein Folding;Site-directed Mutagenesis;Trafficking;Transporters;X-ray Crystallography;Anion Exchanger 1 (AE1);Band 3;SLC4

Herein, we present a new method that can be used to determine the major characteristics of the folding energy landscape in question, for example, to distinguish between activated and barrierless downhill folding scenarios. This method is based on the idea that the conformational relaxation kinetics of different folding mechanisms at a given final condition will show different dependences on the initial condition. We show, using both simulation and experiment, that it is possible to differentiate between disparate kinetic folding models by comparing temperature-jump (T-jump) relaxation traces obtained with a fixed final temperature and varied initial temperatures, which effectively varies the initial potential (VIP) of the system of interest. We apply this method (hereafter refer to as VIPT-jump) to two model systems, Trpzip-2c and BBL, and our results show that BBL exhibits characteristics of barrierless downhill folding, whereas Trpzip-2c folding encounters a free energy barrier. In addition, using the T-jump data of BBL we are able to provide, via Langevin Dynamics simulations, a realistic estimate of its conformational diffusion coefficient.",

Structurally, Mgm101 forms large oligomeric rings. Here we determine the function(s) of a 32–amino acid carboxyl-terminal tail (Mgm101238–269) conserved in the Mgm101 family of proteins. Mutagenic analysis shows that Lys-253, Trp-257, Arg-259, and Tyr-268 are essential for mtDNA maintenance. Mutations in Lys-251, Arg-252, Lys-260, and Tyr-266 affect mtDNA stability at 37°C and under oxidative stress. The Y268A mutation severely affects single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding without altering the ring structure. Mutations in the Lys-251–Arg-252–Lys-253 positive triad also affect ssDNA binding. Moreover, the C-tail alone is sufficient to mediate ssDNA binding. Finally, we find that the W257A and R259A mutations dramatically affect the conformation and oligomeric state of Mgm101. These structural alterations correlate with protein degradation in vivo. The data thus indicate that the C-tail of Mgm101, likely displayed on the ring surface, is required for ssDNA binding, higher-order structural organization, and protein stability. We speculate that an initial electrostatic and base-stacking interaction with ssDNA could remodel ring organization. This may facilitate the formation of nucleoprotein filaments competent for mtDNA repair. These findings could have broad implications for understanding how SSAPs promote DNA repair and genome maintenance.",

We investigate polyelectrolyte properties of poly(dT), an important and widely studied model system for flexible single stranded nucleic acids, in physiologically important mixed mono- and di-valent salt. We report measurements of the form factor and interparticle interactions using SAXS, end to end distances using smFRET, and number of excess ions using ASAXS. We present a coarse-grained model that accounts for flexibility, excluded volume, and electrostatic interactions in these systems. Predictions of the model are validated against experiment.

The active site is highly recessed due to the FKBP12-Rapamycin binding (FRB) domain and an inhibitory helix protruding from the catalytic cleft. mTOR activating mutations map to the structural framework that holds these elements in place, indicating the kinase is controlled by restricted access. In vitro biochemistry indicates that the FRB domain acts as a gatekeeper, with its rapamycin-binding site interacting with substrates to grant them access to the restricted active site. FKBP12-rapamycin inhibits by directly blocking substrate recruitment and by further restricting active site access. The structures also reveal active site residues and conformational changes that underlie inhibitor potency and specificity.",

In pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis there are five paralogous ESX secretion systems, named ESX-1 through ESX-5. Each system includes a substilisin-like protease (mycosin or MycP) as a core component essential for secretion. Here we report crystal structures of MycP1 and MycP3, the mycosins expressed by the ESX-1 and ESX-3 systems, respectively. In both mycosins the putative propeptide wraps around the catalytic domain and does not occlude the active site. The extensive contacts between the putative propeptide and catalytic domain, which include a disulfide bond, suggest that the N-terminal extension is an integral part of the active mycosin. The catalytic residues of MycP1 and MycP3 are located in a deep active site groove in contrast with an exposed active site in majority of subtilisins. We show that MycP1 specifically cleaves ESX-1 secretion-associated protein B (EspB) in vitro at residues Ala358 and Ala386. We also systematically characterize the specificity of MycP1 using peptide libraries, and show that it has evolved a narrow specificity relative to other subtilisins. Finally, comparison of the MycP1 and MycP3 structures suggest that both enzymes have stringent and different specificity profiles that result from the structurally distinct active site pockets, which could explain the system specific functioning of these proteases.",MycP;subtilisin;M. tuberculosis;type VII secretion system;ESX;EspB

We observe that budding yeast Cks associates with select phosphorylated sequences in cell cycle regulatory proteins. We characterize the molecular interactions responsible for this specificity and demonstrate that Cks enhances Cdk activity in response to specific priming phosphosites. Identification of the binding consensus sequence allows us to identify putative Cks-directed Cdk substrates and binding partners. We characterize novel Cks binding sites in the mitotic regulator Wee1 and discover a novel role for Cks in regulating Cdk activity at mitotic entry.

It is not clear why sHSPs are able to bind a wide spectrum of non-native substrate proteins and how such binding is enhanced by heat shock. Here, by utilizing a genetically incorporated photo-cross-linker (p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine), we systematically characterized the substrate-binding residues in IbpB (a sHSP from Escherichia coli) in living cells over a wide spectrum of temperatures (from 20 to 50 °C). A total of 20 and 48 residues were identified at normal and heat shock temperatures, respectively. They are not necessarily hydrophobic and can be classified into three types: types I and II were activated at low and normal temperatures, respectively, and type III mediated oligomerization at low temperature but switched to substrate binding at heat shock temperature. In addition, substrate binding of IbpB in living cells began at temperatures as low as 25 °C and was further enhanced upon temperature elevation. Together, these in vivo data provide novel structural insights into the wide substrate spectrum of sHSPs and suggest that sHSP is able to hierarchically activate its multi-type substrate-binding residues and thus act as a robust chaperone in cells under fluctuating growth conditions.",Chaperone Chaperonin;Chemical Biology;Intrinsically Disordered Proteins;Protein Aggregation;Protein Cross-linking;Protein-Protein Interactions;Site-directed Mutagenesis;Small Heat Shock Proteins;IbpB;Hydrophobic

SCOP2 was designed to provide a more advanced framework for protein structure annotation and classification. It defines a new approach to the classification of proteins that is essentially different from SCOP, but retains its best features. The SCOP2 classification is described in terms of a directed acyclic graph in which nodes form a complex network of many-to-many relationships and are represented by a region of protein structure and sequence.

China Antique from NE China have viability as long as ~1300 years determined by direct radiocarbon-dating, having a germination rate of 84%. The pericarp, a fruit tissue that encloses the single seeds of Nelumbo, is considered one of the major factors that contribute to fruit longevity. Proteins that are heat stable and have protective function may be equally important to seed viability. We show proteins of Nelumbo fruit that are able to withstand heating, 31% of which remained soluble in the 110°C-treated embryo-axis of a 549-yr-old fruit and 76% retained fluidity in its cotyledons. Genome of Nelumbo is published. The amino-acid sequences of 11 “thermal proteins” (soluble at 100°C) of modern Nelumbo embryo-axes and cotyledons, identified by mass spectrometry, Western blot and bioassay, are assembled and aligned with those of an archaeal-hyperthermophile Methancaldococcus jannaschii (Mj; an anaerobic methanogen having a growth optimum of 85°C) and with five mesophile angiosperms. These thermal proteins have roles in protection and repair under stress. More than half of the Nelumbo thermal proteins (55%) are present in the archaean Mj, indicating their long-term durability and history. One Nelumbo protein-repair enzyme exhibits activity at 100°C, having a higher heat-tolerance than that of Arabidopsis.

Consistent with their helicase ancestry, these enzymes experience conformation changes as they bind and hydrolyze ATP. At the same time they interact with DNA and histones, which alters histone–DNA interactions in target nucleosomes. Their action may lead to complete or partial disassembly of nucleosomes, the exchange of histones for variants, the assembly of nucleosomes, or the movement of histone octamers on DNA. “Remodeling” may render DNA sequences accessible to interacting proteins or, conversely, promote packing into tightly folded structures. Remodeling processes participate in every aspect of genome function. Remodeling activities are commonly integrated with other mechanisms such as histone modifications or RNA metabolism to assemble stable, epigenetic states.",

These results are consistent with the prevailing hypothesis that the direct interaction of α-synuclein with pesticides is one of many suspected factors leading to α-synuclein fibrillation and ultimately to Parkinson’s disease. In this study, the biophysical properties and fibrillation kinetics of α-synuclein in the presence of rotenone were investigated and, more specifically, the effects of rotenone on the early-stage misfolded forms of α-synuclein were considered. The thioflavine T (ThT) fluorescence assay studies provide evidence that early-phase misfolded α-synuclein forms are affected by rotenone and that the fibrillation process is accelerated. Further characterization by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) shows that rotenone increases the amount of ordered secondary structure in this intrinsically disordered protein. Morphological characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) provide visualization of the differences in the aggregated α-synuclein species developing during the early kinetics of the fibrillation process in the absence and presence of rotenone. We believe that these data provide useful information for a better understanding of the molecular basis of rotenone-induced misfolding and aggregation of α-synuclein.",α-Synuclein;Parkinson’s disease;environmental toxin;misfolding;fibrillation;intrinsically disordered protein;pesticide;agrochemical;rotenone

In infected plant cells, OFV and nucleorhabdoviruses induce an intranuclear electron-lucent viroplasm that is believed to be the site for virus replication. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which OFV viroplasms are produced in vivo. Among OFV-encoded proteins, the nucleocapsid protein (N) and the putative phosphoprotein (P) were present in nuclear fractions of OFV-infected Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Transient coexpression of N and P, in the absence of virus infection, was shown to be sufficient for formation of an intranuclear viroplasm-like structure in plant cells. When expressed independently as a fluorescent protein fusion product in uninfected plant cells, N protein accumulated throughout the cell, while P protein accumulated in the nucleus. However, the N protein, when coexpressed with P, was recruited to a subnuclear region to induce a large viroplasm-like focus. Deletion and substitution mutagenesis demonstrated that the P protein contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS). Artificial nuclear targeting of the N-protein mutant was insufficient for formation of viroplasm-like structures in the absence of P. A bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay confirmed interactions between the N and P proteins within subnuclear viroplasm-like foci and interactions of two of the N. benthamiana importin-α homologues with the P protein but not with the N protein. Taken together, our results suggest that viroplasm formation by OFV requires nuclear accumulation of both the N and P proteins, which is mediated by P-NLS, unlike nucleorhabdovirus viroplasm utilizing the NLS on protein N.",

NMR, photocrosslinking, and biochemical analyses revealed that PUMA SAHBs engage an α1/α6 trigger site on BAX to initiate its functional activation. We further demonstrated that a cell-permeable PUMA SAHB analog induces apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells and, like expressed PUMA protein, engages BCL-2, MCL-1 and BAX.

Structure model assessment is a critical area of NMR methods development, and is an essential component of the process of making these structures accessible and useful to the wider scientific community. For these reasons, the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) has convened an NMR Validation Task Force (NMR-VTF) to work with the wwPDB partners in developing metrics and policies for biomolecular NMR data harvesting, structure representation, and structure quality assessment.

These states are difficult to study as their low population and transient nature makes them effectively invisible to conventional structural and biophysical techniques. In the present article, I summarize recent NMR developments in our laboratory, including the use of paramagnetic relaxation enhancement, lifetime line broadening and dark-state exchange saturation transfer spectroscopy, that have permitted such sparsely populated states to be detected, characterized and, in some instances, visualized. I illustrate the application of these methods to the elucidation of mechanisms whereby transcription factors locate their specific target sites within an overwhelming sea of non-specific DNA, to the characterization of encounter complexes in protein–protein recognition, to largescale interdomain motions involved in ligand binding, and to the interaction of monomeric amyloid β-peptide with the surface of amyloid protofibrils and the internal cavity surface of the chaperonin GroEL.",conformational selection;encounter complex;induced fit;macromolecular assembly;protein-DNA interaction;sparsely populated state

Recent transcriptome-wide analysis of AS using RNA sequencing has revealed that AS is highly pervasive in plants. Pre-mRNAs from over 60% of intron-containing genes undergo AS to produce a vast repertoire of mRNA isoforms. The functions of most splice variants are unknown. However, emerging evidence indicates that splice variants increase the functional diversity of proteins. Furthermore, AS is coupled to transcript stability and translation through nonsense-mediated decay and microRNA-mediated gene regulation. Widespread changes in AS in response to developmental cues and stresses suggest a role for regulated splicing in plant development and stress responses. Here, we review recent progress in uncovering the extent and complexity of the AS landscape in plants, its regulation, and the roles of AS in gene regulation. The prevalence of AS in plants has raised many new questions that require additional studies. New tools based on recent technological advances are allowing genome-wide analysis of RNA elements in transcripts and of chromatin modifications that regulate AS. Application of these tools in plants will provide significant new insights into AS regulation and crosstalk between AS and other layers of gene regulation.",

Indeed, the accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein now defines multiple forms of neural degeneration. Like many of the proteins that accumulate in other neurodegenerative disorders, however, the normal function of synuclein remains poorly understood. α-Synuclein localizes specifically to the nerve terminal and inhibits neurotransmitter release when over-expressed, but the knockout has a modest effect on synaptic transmission, suggesting alternative presynaptic roles. Natively unstructured, synuclein adopts a helical conformation on membrane binding and recent work suggests a role in membrane remodeling. In neural degeneration, synuclein misfolds and aggregates as a β-sheet. Multiple observations now suggest propagation of the misfolded protein as a prion, providing a mechanism for the spread of degeneration through the neuraxis. However, the factors that trigger the original misfolding remain unknown.",

They consist of an N-terminal β-helical domain (“passenger domain”) that is secreted into the extracellular space and a C-terminal β-barrel domain (“β-domain”) that anchors the protein to the outer membrane. Because the periplasm lacks ATP, vectorial folding of the passenger domain in a C-to-N-terminal direction has been proposed to drive the secretion reaction. Consistent with this hypothesis, mutations that disrupt the folding of the C terminus of the passenger domain of the Escherichia coli O157:H7 autotransporter EspP have been shown to cause strong secretion defects. Here, we show that point mutations introduced at specific locations near the middle or N terminus of the EspP β-helix that perturb folding also impair secretion, but to a lesser degree. Surprisingly, we found that even multiple mutations that potentially abolish the stability of several consecutive rungs of the β-helix only moderately reduce secretion efficiency. Although these results provide evidence that the free energy derived from passenger domain folding contributes to secretion efficiency, they also suggest that a significant fraction of the energy required for secretion is derived from another source.",Escherichia coli;Membrane Proteins;Protein Folding;Protein Translocation;Virulence Factors;Autotransporter

Recombination in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was documented more than 4 decades ago, but the underlying molecular mechanism has remained elusive. Recent studies have revealed the presence of a Rad52-type recombination system of bacteriophage origin in mitochondria, which operates by a single-strand annealing mechanism independent of the canonical RecA/Rad51-type recombinases. Increasing evidence supports the notion that, like in bacteriophages, mtDNA inheritance is a coordinated interplay between recombination, repair, and replication. These findings could have profound implications for understanding the mechanism of mtDNA inheritance and the generation of mtDNA deletions in aging cells.",

The best-characterized substrates of La proteins are pre-tRNAs, and previous work using tRNA mediated suppression in Schizosaccharomyces pombe has demonstrated that yeast and human La enhance the maturation of these using two distinguishable activities: UUU-3′OH-dependent trailer binding/protection and a UUU-3′OH independent activity related to RNA chaperone function.

Although diverse N-terminal basolateral targeting signals from multi-pass membrane proteins can all redirect apical protein from the same gene family to the basolateral membrane, none of the N-terminal basolateral targeting signals can redirect the TM and C-terminus regions from a different gene family. Instead, the presence of these heterologous N-terminal basolateral targeting signals affected the trafficking of otherwise apical protein, causing their accumulation in a stable tubulin-like non-actin structures. Non-targeting N-terminal sequences had no effect. Similar protein retention was observed previously and in this study when the C-terminus of apical or basolateral protein was mutated. These results suggest that the N- and C-termini interact, directly or indirectly, within each gene family for basolateral targeting. CD and 2D NMR analyses both found a lack of regular secondary structure in the conserved SVCT2 N-terminus, consistent with the presence of partner(s) in the targeting unit. Our finding, a departure from the prevailing single peptide motif model, is consistent with the evolution of basolateral transporters from the corresponding apical genes. The interaction among the N-terminus, its partner(s) and the cellular basolateral targeting machinery needs to be further elucidated.",

Mechanistically, the H4 tails of one nucleosome bind to the acidic patch region on the surface of adjacent nucleosomes, causing fibre compaction. The functionality of the chromatin fibre can be modified by proteins that interact with the nucleosome. The co-structures of five different proteins with the nucleosome (LANA, IL-33, RCC1, Sir3 and HMGN2) recently have been examined by experimental and computational studies. Interestingly, each of these proteins displays steric, ionic and hydrogen bond complementarity with the acidic patch, and therefore will compete with each other for binding to the nucleosome. We first review the molecular details of each interface, focusing on the key non-covalent interactions that stabilize the protein–acidic patch interactions. We then propose a model in which binding of proteins to the nucleosome disrupts interaction of the H4 tail domains with the acidic patch, preventing the intrinsic chromatin folding pathway and leading to assembly of alternative higher order chromatin structures with unique biological functions.",chromatin structure;nucleosome-binding proteins;higher order folding

Amelogenin forms into nanospheres in solution, while its association with hydroxyapatite is also essential to enamel development. Structural information of full-length amelogenin in either of these physiologically important forms has the potential to provide mechanistic information; however, these data are limited because of the difficulty of determining the structure of large protein complexes and proteins bound to surfaces. To obtain structural insights into amelogenin during these early stages of enamel development, we used a lysine-specific 13C-, 15N-labeled sample of murine amelogenin to provide insight into the structure of the hydroxyapatite (HAP)-binding domains of the protein. A combination of one-and two-dimensional solid-state NMR experiments was used to obtain molecular-level insights into the secondary structure and dynamics of full-length amelogenin within a nanosphere-gel and on the surface of HAP. Regions of amelogenin that appear to be primarily random coil in the nanosphere-gel adopt a β-strand structure and are less mobile with HAP binding, indicative of a structural switch upon binding that may be important in the role of amelogenin in enamel development.",solid-state NMR;biomineralization;enamel;amelogenin;structural characterization;nanosphere

Our gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation results showed that the DMP12 monomer interacts with the dimeric form of the bacterial histone-like protein HU. Subsequent structural analysis of DMP12 showed that the shape and electrostatic surface of the DMP12 monomer are similar to those of the straight portion of the bent HU-bound DNA and complementary to those of HU protein dimer. DMP12 also protects HU protein from limited digestion by trypsin and enhances the growth rate Escherichia coli. Functionally, HU proteins participate in bacterial nucleoid formation, as well as recombination, gene regulation and DNA replication. The interaction between DMP12 and HU protein might, therefore, play important roles in these DNA-related mechanisms.",

We characterized Arabidopsis thaliana lines ectopically expressing a phloem-specific gene encoding NDR1/HIN1-like26 (NHL26), a putative membrane protein. NHL26 overexpressor plants grew more slowly than wild-type plants, accumulated high levels of carbohydrates in mature leaves, and had a higher shoot biomass, contrasting with slower root growth and a lower seed yield. Similar effects were observed when NHL26 was overexpressed in companion cells, under the control of a companion cell–specific promoter. The soluble sugar content of the phloem sap and sink organs was lower than that in the wild type, providing evidence of a sugar export defect. This was confirmed in a phloem-export assay with the symplastic tracer carboxyfluorescein diacetate. Leaf sugar accumulation was accompanied by higher organic acid, amino acid, and protein contents, whereas analysis of the metabolite profile of phloem sap exudate revealed no change in amino acid or organic acid content, indicating a specific effect on sugar export. NHL26 was found to be located in the phloem plasmodesmata and the endoplasmic reticulum.

Among other functions it is also critically required for Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction. In the present study we provide for the first time a mechanistic basis for the β-arrestin function in Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We demonstrate that β-arrestin is required for efficient Wnt3a-induced Lrp6 phosphorylation, a key event in downstream signaling. β-Arrestin regulates Lrp6 phosphorylation via a novel interaction with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2)-binding protein Amer1/WTX/Fam123b. Amer1 has been shown very recently to bridge Wnt-induced and Dishevelled-associated PtdIns(4,5)P2 production to the phosphorylation of Lrp6. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching we show here that β-arrestin is required for the Wnt3a-induced Amer1 membrane dynamics and downstream signaling. Finally, we show that β-arrestin interacts with PtdIns kinases PI4KIIα and PIP5KIβ. Importantly, cells lacking β-arrestin showed higher steady-state levels of the relevant PtdInsP and were unable to increase levels of these PtdInsP in response to Wnt3a. In summary, our data show that β-arrestins regulate Wnt3a-induced Lrp6 phosphorylation by the regulation of the membrane dynamics of Amer1. We propose that β-arrestins via their scaffolding function facilitate Amer1 interaction with PtdIns(4,5)P2, which is produced locally upon Wnt3a stimulation by β-arrestin- and Dishevelled-associated kinases.",β-Catenin;Membrane Lipids;Phosphatidylinositol Kinase;Phosphatidylinositol Signaling;Wnt Signaling;Amer1/WTX/FAM123B;β-Arrestin;Dvl;Lrp6 Phosphorylation;Phosphatidylinositol Phosphate Kinase

","Aggregation of tau protein in the brain is associated with a class of neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies. FK506 binding protein 51 kDa (FKBP51, encoded by FKBP5) forms a mature chaperone complex with Hsp90 that prevents tau degradation. In this study, we have shown that tau levels are reduced throughout the brains of Fkbp5–/– mice. Recombinant FKBP51 and Hsp90 synergized to block tau clearance through the proteasome, resulting in tau oligomerization. Overexpression of FKBP51 in a tau transgenic mouse model revealed that FKBP51 preserved the species of tau that have been linked to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis, blocked amyloid formation, and decreased tangle load in the brain. Alterations in tau turnover and aggregate structure corresponded with enhanced neurotoxicity in mice. In human brains, FKBP51 levels increased relative to age and AD, corresponding with demethylation of the regulatory regions in the FKBP5 gene. We also found that higher FKBP51 levels were associated with AD progression. Our data support a model in which age-associated increases in FKBP51 levels and its interaction with Hsp90 promote neurotoxic tau accumulation. Strategies aimed at attenuating FKBP51 levels or its interaction with Hsp90 have the potential to be therapeutically relevant for AD and other tauopathies.",

The affinity of TRIM5α for the capsid is a major host tropism determinant of HIV and other primate immunodeficiency viruses, but the molecular interface involved in this host–pathogen interaction remains poorly characterized. Here we use NMR spectroscopy to investigate binding of the rhesus TRIM5α SPRY domain to a selection of HIV capsid constructs. The data are consistent with a model in which one SPRY domain interacts with more than one capsid monomer within the assembled retroviral core. The highly mobile SPRY v1 loop appears to span the gap between neighboring capsid hexamers making interhexamer contacts critical for restriction. The interaction interface is extensive, involves mobile loops and multiple epitopes, and lacks interaction hot spots. These properties, which may enhance resistance of TRIM5α to capsid mutations, result in relatively low affinity of the individual SPRY domains for the capsid, and the TRIM5α-mediated restriction depends on the avidity effect arising from the oligomerization of TRIM5α.",TRIM5α;HIV;NMR;SPRY

In the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, most small molecules are taken up by outer membrane carboxylate channel (Occ) proteins, which can be divided into two distinct subfamilies, OccD and OccK. Here we characterize substrate transport mediated by Occ proteins belonging to both subfamilies. Based on the determination of the OccK2-glucuronate co-crystal structure, we identify the channel residues that are essential for substrate transport. We further show that the pore regions of the channels are rigid in the OccK subfamily and highly dynamic in the OccD subfamily. We also demonstrate that the substrate carboxylate group interacts with central residues of the basic ladder, a row of arginine and lysine residues that leads to and away from the binding site at the channel constriction. Moreover, the importance of the basic ladder residues corresponds to their degree of conservation.

In this study, we describe a novel interaction between Pin1, a phosphorylation-specific prolyl isomerase, and phosphorylated histone H1. A sub-stoichiometric amount of Pin1 stimulated the dephosphorylation of H1 in vitro and modulated the structure of the C-terminal domain of H1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Depletion of Pin1 destabilized H1 binding to chromatin only when Pin1 binding sites on H1 were present. Pin1 recruitment and localized histone H1 phosphorylation were associated with transcriptional activation independent of RNA polymerase II. We thus identify a novel form of histone H1 regulation through phosphorylation-dependent proline isomerization, which has consequences on overall H1 phosphorylation levels and the stability of H1 binding to chromatin.",

Changes in expression of ETS proteins therefore have a significant impact on normal physiology of the cell. Transcriptional consequences of ETS protein deregulation by overexpression, gene fusion, and modulation by RAS/MAPK signaling are linked to alterations in normal cell functions, and lead to unlimited increased proliferation, sustained angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. Existing data show that ETS proteins control pathways in epithelial cells as well as stromal compartments, and the crosstalk between the two is essential for normal development and cancer. In this review we have focused on ETS factors with a known contribution in cancer development. Instead of focusing on a prototype, we address cancer associated ETS proteins and have highlighted the diverse mechanisms by which they affect carcinogenesis. Finally, we discuss strategies for ETS factor targeting as a potential means for cancer therapeutics.",

Since Rnf2 lacks DNA-specific binding activity, other factors must mediate its site-specific chromatin recruitment. Rnf2 and Af9 co-localized in the nucleus and co-immunoprecipitated. A GST (glutathione transferase)–Af9 carboxy-terminal fusion protein directly interacted with in vitro translated Rnf2 in GST pull-down assays. Rnf2 knock down enhanced basal and aldosterone-stimulated α-ENaC mRNA levels and α-ENaC promoter activity. ChIP/QPCR (chromatin immunoprecipitation/quantitative PCR) assays demonstrated enrichment of Rnf2, H2AK119 (mono-ubiquitinated histone H2A lysine 119), and H3K27me3 (histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylated), a PRC2 chromatin mark, at multiple α-ENaC promoter subregions corresponding to regions of known Af9 enrichment, under basal conditions. Sequential ChIP confirmed Rnf2–Af9 co-occupancy of the α-ENaC promoter. Aldosterone provoked early and sustained depletion of Rnf2, ubiquitinated H2AK119, and trimethylated H3K27 associated with the subregions of the α-ENaC promoter. Thus, Af9 mediates site-selective physical and functional recruitment of Rnf2 to the α-ENaC promoter to constrain basal α-ENaC transcription in collecting duct cells, and aldosterone reverses this process.",aldosterone;epigenetics;H2AK119;H3K27;methyltransferase;Polycomb

We found that NML is an RNA binding protein that copurifies with 5S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNA. The SirT1 and RNA binding regions on NML showed partial overlap, and the NML-SirT1 interaction was competitively inhibited by rRNA. Nutrient deprivation triggered downregulation of rRNA transcription, reduced the level of NML-associated rRNA, and stimulated NML-SirT1 binding. Assembly of eNoSC facilitated repression of pre-rRNA transcription. These results suggest that nascent rRNA generates a positive-feedback signal by suppressing the assembly of eNoSC and protecting active ribosomal DNA units from heterochromatin formation. This RNA-mediated mechanism enables the eNoSC to amplify the effects of upstream nutrient-responsive regulators.",

Although a large number of mutations have been detected through genetic screening of the human GALT (hGALT) locus, for many it is not known how they cause their effects. The majority of these mutations are missense, with predicted substitutions scattered throughout the enzyme structure and thus causing impairment by other means rather than direct alterations to the active site. To clarify the fundamental, molecular basis of hGALT impairment we studied five disease-associated variants p.D28Y, p.L74P, p.F171S, p.F194L and p.R333G using both a yeast model and purified, recombinant proteins. In a yeast expression system there was a correlation between lysate activity and the ability to rescue growth in the presence of galactose, except for p.R333G. Kinetic analysis of the purified proteins quantified each variant’s level of enzymatic impairment and demonstrated that this was largely due to altered substrate binding. Increased surface hydrophobicity, altered thermal stability and changes in proteolytic sensitivity were also detected. Our results demonstrate that hGALT requires a level of flexibility to function optimally and that altered folding is the underlying reason of impairment in all the variants tested here. This indicates that misfolding is a common, molecular basis of hGALT deficiency and suggests the potential of pharmacological chaperones and proteostasis regulators as novel therapeutic approaches for type I galactosemia.",GALT;yeast model;disease associated mutation;stability;substrate binding;protein misfolding

Of the seven C2 domains in dysferlin, only C2A is reported to bind both Ca2+ and phospholipid, thus acting as a key sensor in membrane repair. Dysferlin C2A exists as two isoforms, the “canonical” C2A and C2A variant 1 (C2Av1). Interestingly, these isoforms have markedly different responses to Ca2+ and phospholipid. Structural and thermodynamic analyses are consistent with the canonical C2A domain as a Ca2+-dependent, phospholipid-binding domain, whereas C2Av1 would likely be Ca2+-independent under physiological conditions. Additionally, both isoforms display remarkably low free energies of stability, indicative of a highly flexible structure. The inverted ligand preference and flexibility for both C2A isoforms suggest the capability for both constitutive and Ca2+-regulated effector interactions, an activity that would be essential in its role as a mediator of membrane repair.",

This tumour suppressor protein has three main domains; the N-terminal transactivation domain, the CTD (C-terminal domain) and the core domain (p53C) that constitutes the sequence-specific DBD (DNA-binding region). Most p53 mutations related to cancer development are found in the DBD. Aggregation of p53 into amyloid oligomers and fibrils has been shown. Moreover, amyloid aggregates of both the mutant and WT (wild-type) forms of p53 were detected in tumour tissues. We propose that if p53 aggregation occurred, it would be a crucial aspect of cancer development, as p53 would lose its WT functions in an aggregated state. Mutant p53 can also exert a dominant-negative regulatory effect on WT p53. Herein, we discuss the dominant-negative effect in light of p53 aggregation and the fact that amyloid-like mutant p53 can convert WT p53 into more aggregated species, leading into gain of function in addition to the loss of tumour suppressor function.

Full-length Bid is cleaved in response to apoptotic stimuli into two fragments, p7 and tBid (p15), that are held together by strong hydrophobic interactions until the complex binds to membranes. The detailed mechanism(s) of fragment separation including tBid binding to membranes and release of the p7 fragment to the cytoplasm remain unclear. Using liposomes or isolated mitochondria with fluorescently labeled proteins at physiological concentrations as in vitro models, we report that the two components of the complex quickly separate upon interaction with a membrane. Once tBid binds to the membrane, it undergoes slow structural rearrangements that result in an equilibrium between two major tBid conformations on the membrane. The conformational change of tBid is a prerequisite for interaction with Bax and is, therefore, a novel step that can be modulated to promote or inhibit MOMP. Using automated high-throughput image analysis in cells, we show that down-regulation of Mtch2 causes a significant delay between tBid and Bax relocalization in cells. We propose that by promoting insertion of tBid via a conformational change at the mitochondrial outer membrane, Mtch2 accelerates tBid-mediated Bax activation and MOMP. Thus the interaction of Mtch2 and tBid is a potential target for therapeutic control of Bid initiated cell death.",Apoptosis;Bax;Bcl-2 Proteins;Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy;Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET);Protein Conformation;Bid;Mtch2;Fluorescence Spectroscopy;tBid

Measles virus (MeV) N features an amino-terminal RNA-binding core and a 125-residue tail domain, of which only the last 75 residues are considered fully mobile on the nucleocapsid surface. A molecular recognition element (MoRE) domain mediates binding of the viral phosphoprotein (P). This P N-tail interaction is considered instrumental for recruiting the polymerase complex to the template. We have engineered MeV N variants with tail truncations progressively eliminating the MoRE domain and upstream tail sections. Confirming previous reports, RNPs with N truncations lacking the carboxyl-terminal 43-residues harboring the MoRE domain cannot serve as polymerase template. Remarkably, further removal of all tail residues predicted to be surface-exposed significantly restores RNP bioactivity. Insertion of structurally dominant tags into the central N-tail section reduces bioactivity, but the negative regulatory effect of exposed N-tail stems is sequence-independent. Bioactive nucleocapsids lacking exposed N-tail sections are unable to sustain virus replication, because of weakened interaction of the advancing polymerase complex with the template. Deletion of the N-MoRE-binding domain in P abrogates polymerase recruitment to standard nucleocapsids, but polymerase activity is partially restored when N-tail truncated RNPs serve as template. Revising central elements of the current replication model, these data reveal that MeV polymerase is capable of productively docking directly to the nucleocapsid core. Dispensable for polymerase recruitment, N-MoRE binding to P-tail stabilizes the advancing polymerase-RNP complex and may rearrange unstructured central tail sections to facilitate polymerase access to the template.",Animal Viruses;Microbiology;Viral Polymerase;Viral Replication;Virus

Patel: gro.ccksm@dletap ","MazF is an mRNA interferase, which, upon activation during stress conditions, cleaves mRNAs in a sequence-specific manner, resulting in cellular growth arrest. During normal growth conditions, the MazF toxin is inactivated through binding to its cognate antitoxin, MazE. How MazF specifically recognizes its mRNA target and carries out cleavage and how the formation of the MazE-MazF complex inactivates MazF remain unclear. We present crystal structures of MazF in complex with mRNA substrate and antitoxin MazE in Bacillus subtilis. The structure of MazF in complex with uncleavable UUdUACAUAA RNA substrate defines the molecular basis underlying the sequence-specific recognition of UACAU and the role of residues involved in the cleavage through site-specific mutational studies. The structure of the heterohexameric (MazF)2-(MazE)2-(MazF)2 complex in Bacillus subtilis, supplemented by mutational data, demonstrates that the positioning of the C-terminal helical segment of MazE within the RNA-binding channel of the MazF dimer prevents mRNA binding and cleavage by MazF.",

Spatial distribution of amyloid-like proteins into intracellular quality control centers can be beneficial, but cellular mechanisms for protective aggregation remain unclear. We used a high-copy suppressor screen in yeast to identify roles for the Hsp70 system in spatial organization of toxic polyglutamine-expanded Huntingtin (Huntingtin with 103Q glutamine stretch [Htt103Q]) into benign assemblies. Under toxic conditions, Htt103Q accumulates in unassembled states and speckled cytosolic foci. Subtle modulation of Sti1 activity reciprocally affects Htt toxicity and the packaging of Htt103Q into foci. Loss of Sti1 exacerbates Htt toxicity and hinders foci formation, whereas elevation of Sti1 suppresses Htt toxicity while organizing small Htt103Q foci into larger assemblies. Sti1 also suppresses cytotoxicity of the glutamine-rich yeast prion [RNQ+] while reorganizing speckled Rnq1–monomeric red fluorescent protein into distinct foci. Sti1-inducible foci are perinuclear and contain proteins that are bound by the amyloid indicator dye thioflavin-T. Sti1 is an Hsp70 cochaperone that regulates the spatial organization of amyloid-like proteins in the cytosol and thereby buffers proteotoxicity caused by amyloid-like proteins.",

We characterize here the structure of the DnaJ-RepE complex by electron microscopy, the first described structure of a complex between an Hsp40 and a client protein. The comparison of the complexes of DnaJ with two RepE mutants reveals an intrinsic plasticity of the DnaJ dimer that allows the chaperone to adapt to different substrates.

In the nucleus, Pdcd4 affects the transcription of specific genes by modulating the activity of several transcription factors. We have identified the Daxx protein as a novel interaction partner of Pdcd4. Daxx is a scaffold protein with roles in diverse processes, including transcriptional regulation, DNA-damage signaling, apoptosis and chromatin remodeling. We show that the interaction of both proteins is mediated by the N-terminal domain of Pdcd4 and the central part of Daxx, and that binding to Pdcd4 stimulates the degradation of Daxx, presumably by disrupting the interaction of Daxx with the de-ubiquitinylating enzyme Hausp. Daxx has previously been shown to serve as a scaffold for protein kinase Hipk2 and tumor suppressor protein p53 and to stimulate the phosphorylation of p53 at serine 46 (Ser-46) in response to genotoxic stress. We show that Pdcd4 also disrupts the Daxx–Hipk2 interaction and inhibits the phosphorylation of p53. We also show that ultraviolet irradiation decreases the expression of Pdcd4. Taken together, our results support a model in which Pdcd4 serves to suppress the phosphorylation of p53 in the absence of DNA damage, while the suppressive effect of Pdcd4 is abrogated after DNA damage owing to the decrease of Pdcd4. Overall, our data demonstrate that Pdcd4 is a novel modulator of Daxx function and provide evidence for a role of Pdcd4 in restraining p53 activity in unstressed cells.",Pdcd4;Daxx;protein–protein interaction;p53

A. actinomycetemcomitans secretes a repeats-in-toxin protein, leukotoxin, which exclusively kills lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1-bearing cells. The toxin's pathological mechanism is not fully understood; however, experimental evidence indicates that it involves the association with and subsequent destabilization of the target cell's plasma membrane. We have long hypothesized that leukotoxin secondary structure is strongly correlated with membrane association and/or destabilization. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by analyzing lipid-induced changes in leukotoxin conformation. Upon incubation of leukotoxin with lipids that favor leukotoxin-membrane association, we observed an increase in leukotoxin α-helical content that was not observed with lipids that favor membrane destabilization. The change in leukotoxin conformation after incubation with these lipids suggests that membrane binding and membrane destabilization have distinct secondary structural requirements, suggesting that they are independent events. These studies thus provide insight into the mechanism of cell damage that leads to disease progression by A. actinomycetemcomitans.",Conformation;intrinsic disorder;alpha helix;unordered;lipid membrane

Recent experiments suggested that LC8 binding to Nek9 was regulated by Nek9 autophosphorylation on Ser944, a residue immediately located N-terminal to the LC8 conserved (K/R)xTQT binding motif, and that this was crucial for the control of signal transduction through the Nek/Nek6/7 module. In the present work, we present two crystal structures of LC8 with a peptide corresponding to the Nek9 binding region with and without a phosphorylation on Ser944. Structural analysis of LC8 with both Nek9 peptides, together with different biophysical experiments, explains the observed diminished binding affinity of Nek9 to LC8 upon phosphorylation on Ser944 within the Nek9 sequence, thus shedding light into a novel phosphorylation regulatory mechanism that interferes with LC8 protein·protein complex formation.",Crystallography;Dynein;Mitotic Spindle;Phosphorylation;Serine Threonine Protein Kinase

Here, we analyzed the relative importance in proteolysis of various structural features derived from substrate sequences using a dataset of more than five thousand experimentally verified proteolytic events captured in CutDB. Accessibility to the solvent was recognized as an essential property of a proteolytically processed polypeptide chain. Proteolytic events were found nearly uniformly distributed among three types of secondary structure, although with some enrichment in loops. Cleavages in α-helices were found to be relatively abundant in regions apparently prone to unfolding, while cleavages in β-structures tended to be located at the periphery of β-sheets. Application of the same statistical procedures to proteolytic events divided into separate sets according to the catalytic classes of proteases proved consistency of the results and confirmed that the structural mechanisms of proteolysis are universal. The estimated prediction power of sequence-derived structural features, which turned out to be sufficiently high, presents a rationale for their use in bioinformatic prediction of proteolytic events.",

A recently described member of conserved proteasome activators is Blm10. Blm10 contains 32 HEAT-like modules and is structurally related to the nuclear import receptor importin/karyopherin β. In proliferating yeast, RP-CP assemblies are primarily nuclear and promote cell division. During quiescence, RP-CP assemblies dissociate and CP and RP are sequestered into motile cytosolic proteasome storage granuli (PSG). Here, we show that CP sequestration into PSG depends on Blm10, whereas RP sequestration into PSG is independent of Blm10. PSG rapidly clear upon the resumption of cell proliferation and proteasomes are relocated into the nucleus. Thereby, Blm10 facilitates nuclear import of CP. Blm10-bound CP serves as an import receptor–cargo complex, as Blm10 mediates the interaction with FG-rich nucleoporins and is dissociated from the CP by Ran-GTP.

Recent evidence indicates that a majority of human proteins involved in amyloid and neural inclusion disorders possess at least some prion properties. In lower eukaryotes, such as yeast, prions act as epigenetic elements, which increase phenotypic diversity by altering a range of cellular processes. While some yeast prions are clearly pathogenic, it is also postulated that prion formation could be beneficial in variable environmental conditions. Yeast and mammalian prions have similar molecular properties. Crucial cellular factors and conditions influencing prion formation and propagation were uncovered in the yeast models. Stress-related chaperones, protein quality control deposits, degradation pathways and cytoskeletal networks control prion formation and propagation in yeast. Environmental stresses trigger prion formation and loss, supposedly acting via influencing intracellular concentrations of the prion-inducing proteins, and/or by localizing prionogenic proteins to the prion induction sites via heterologous ancillary helpers. Physiological and environmental modulation of yeast prions points to new opportunities for pharmacological intervention and/or prophylactic measures targeting general cellular systems rather than the properties of individual amyloids and prions.",amyloid;chaperone;cytoskeleton;heat shock;quality control;ubiquitin

Human UPF2 comprises three tandem MIF4G domains and a C-terminal UPF1 binding region. MIF4G-3 binds UPF3b, but the specific functions of MIF4G-1 and MIF4G-2 are unknown. Crystal structures show that both MIF4G-1 and MIF4G-2 contain N-terminal capping helices essential for stabilization of the 10-helix MIF4G core and that MIF4G-2 interacts with MIF4G-3, forming a rigid assembly. The UPF2/UPF3b/SMG1 complex is thought to activate the kinase SMG1 to phosphorylate UPF1 in vivo. We identify MIF4G-3 as the binding site and in vitro substrate of SMG1 kinase and show that a ternary UPF2 MIF4G-3/UPF3b/SMG1 complex can form in vitro. Whereas in vivo complementation assays show that MIF4G-1 and MIF4G-2 are essential for NMD, tethering assays reveal that UPF2 truncated to only MIF4G-3 and the UPF1-binding region can still partially accomplish NMD. Thus UPF2 MIF4G-1 and MIF4G-2 appear to have a crucial scaffolding role, while MIF4G-3 is the key module required for triggering NMD.",

However, it is not understood how a single protein kinase can trigger hundreds of switches in a sufficiently time-resolved fashion. We show that the cyclin-Cdk1-Cks1-dependent phosphorylation of multisite targets in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is controlled by key substrate parameters including distances between phosphorylation sites, the distribution of serines and threonines as phospho-acceptors, and the positioning of cyclin-docking motifs. The component mediating the key interactions in this process is Cks1, the phospho-adaptor subunit of the cyclin-Cdk1-Cks1 complex. We propose that variation of these parameters within the networks of phosphorylation sites in different targets provides a wide range of possibilities for the differential amplification of Cdk1 signals, providing a mechanism to generate a wide range of thresholds in the cell cycle.",

Activation involves disruption of an inhibitory interaction between the αE helices at the base of the active site and an autoinhibitory (AI) segment in the regulatory M domain and membrane insertion of the M domain as an amphipathic helix. We show that in the CCT soluble form the AI segment functions to suppress kcat and elevate the Km for CTP. The crystal structure of a CCT dimer composed of the catalytic and AI segments reveals an AI-αE interaction as a cluster of four amphipathic helices (two αE and two AI helices) at the base of the active sites. This interaction corroborates mutagenesis implicating multiple hydrophobic residues within the AI segment that contribute to its silencing function. The AI-αE interaction directs the turn at the C-terminal end of the AI helix into backbone-to-backbone contact with a loop (L2) at the opening to the active site, which houses the key catalytic residue, lysine 122. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that lysine 122 side-chain orientations are constrained by contacts with the AI helix-turn, which could obstruct its engagement with substrates.

WF146, matures efficiently at high temperatures. Here we report that the proform, which contains an N-terminal propeptide composed of a core domain (N*) and a linker peptide, is intrinsically able to mature via multiple pathways. One autocatalytic pathway is initiated by cis-processing of N* to generate an autoprocessed complex N*-IWT, and this step is followed by truncation of the linker peptide and degradation of N*. Another autocatalytic pathway is initiated by trans-processing of the linker peptide followed by degradation of N*. Unlike most reported subtilases, the maturation of the WF146 protease occurs not only autocatalytically but also hetero-catalytically whereby heterogeneous proteases accelerate the maturation of the WF146 protease via trans-processing of the proform and N*-IWT. Although N* acts as an intramolecular chaperone and an inhibitor of the mature enzyme, the linker peptide is susceptible to proteolysis, allowing the trans-processing reaction to occur auto- and hetero-catalytically. These studies also demonstrate that the WF146 protease undergoes subtle structural adjustments during the maturation process and that the binding of Ca2+ is required for routing the proform to mature properly at high temperatures. Interestingly, under Ca2+-free conditions, the proform is cis-processed into a unique propeptide-intermediate complex (N*-IE) capable of re-synthesis of the proform. Based on the basic catalytic principle of serine proteases and these experimental results, a mechanism for the cis-processing/re-synthesis equilibrium of the proform and the role of the linker peptide in regulation of this equilibrium has been proposed.",Bacteria;Enzyme Structure;Protein Processing;Protein Stability;Serine Protease;Maturation;Propeptide;Subtilase

A rotating disk shear device is proposed that produces defined shear conditions at a known solid–liquid interface to measure stability in this environment. Five variants of IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies were created using combinations of two discrete triple amino acid sequence mutations denoted TM and YTE. Antibodies were ranked for stability based on shear device output (protein decay coefficient, PDC), and compared with accelerated thermal stability data and the melting temperature of the CH2 domain (Tm1) from differential scanning calorimetry to investigate technique complimentarity. Results suggest that the techniques are orthogonal, with thermal methods based on intramolecular interaction and shear device stability based on localized unfolding revealing less stable regions that drive aggregation. Molecular modeling shows the modifications’ effects on the antibody structures and indicates a possible role for Fc conformation and Fab-Fc docking in determining suspended protein stability. The data introduce the PDC value as an orthogonal stability indicator, complementary to traditional thermal methods, allowing lead antibody selection based on a more full understanding of process stability. © 2013 The Authors.

Previous studies implicated the RAG/DNA post-cleavage complex (PCC) in regulating pathway choice by preventing access to inappropriate repair mechanisms such as homologous recombination (HR) and alternative NHEJ (aNHEJ). Here we report that RAG2’s “acidic hinge”, previously of unknown function, is critical for several key steps. Mutations that reduce the hinge’s negative charge destabilize the PCC, disrupt pathway choice, permit repair of RAG-mediated DSBs by the translocation-prone aNHEJ machinery, and reduce genomic stability in developing lymphocytes. Structural predictions and experimental results support our hypothesis that reduced flexibility of the hinge underlies these outcomes. Furthermore, sequence variants present in the human population reduce the hinge’s negative charge, permit aNHEJ, and diminish genomic integrity.",

Understanding the molecular mechanism of action of these selective modulators will provide significant insight toward the development of the next generation of modulators. Although most nuclear receptor structural studies have primarily focused on obtaining ligand-receptor cocrystal structures, recent studies implicate an important role for protein dynamics in the mechanism of action of nuclear receptor ligands.

Human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (AAG) employs nonspecific DNA binding interactions and facilitated diffusion to conduct a highly redundant search of adjacent sites. This ensures that every site is searched, but could be a detriment if the protein is trapped in a local segment of DNA. Intersegmental transfer between DNA segments that are transiently in close proximity provides an elegant solution that balances global and local searching processes. It has been difficult to detect intersegmental transfer experimentally; therefore, we developed biochemical assays that allowed us to observe and measure the rates of intersegmental transfer by AAG. AAG has a flexible amino terminus that tunes its affinity for nonspecific DNA, but we find that it is not required for intersegmental transfer. As AAG has only a single DNA binding site, this argues against the bridging model for intersegmental transfer. The rates of intersegmental transfer are strongly dependent on the salt concentration, supporting a jumping mechanism that involves microscopic dissociation and capture by a proximal DNA site. As many DNA-binding proteins have only a single binding site, jumping may be a common mechanism for intersegmental transfer.",Base Excision Repair;DNA Repair;Enzyme Kinetics;Enzyme Mechanisms;Mutagenesis Mechanisms;DNA Glycosylase;Facilitated Diffusion;Intersegmental Transfer

Poly(A) polymerase (PAP) is the enzyme that catalyzes the poly(A) addition reaction. Multiple isoforms of PAP have been identified in vertebrates, which originate from gene duplication, alternative splicing, or post-translational modifications. The complexity of PAP isoforms suggests that they might play different roles in the cell. Phylogenetic studies indicate that vertebrate PAPs are grouped into three clades termed α, β and γ, which originated from two gene duplication events. To date, all the available PAP structures are from the PAPα clade. Here, we present the crystal structure of the first representative of the PAPγ clade, human PAPγ, bound to cordycepin triphosphate (3′dATP) and Ca2+. The structure revealed that PAPγ closely resembles its PAPα ortholog. An analysis of residue conservation reveals a conserved catalytic binding pocket, whereas residues at the surface of the polymerase are more divergent.",mRNA processing;3′end processing;polyadenylation;poly(A) polymerase gamma;neo-PAP;cordycepin triphosphate

Most nuclear receptor coregulators function in large multi-protein complexes that modify chromatin and thereby regulate the transcription of target genes. Structural and functional studies are beginning to reveal how these complexes are assembled bringing together multiple functionalities that mediate: recruitment to specific genomic loci through interaction with transcription factors; recruitment of enzymatic activities that either modify or remodel chromatin; and targeting the complexes to their chromatin substrate. These activities are regulated by post-translational modifications, alternative splicing and small signalling molecules.

The release of the immunity protein from the colicin complex is a prerequisite for cell entry of the colicin and occurs via a process that is still relatively poorly understood. We have previously shown that an energy input in the form of the cytoplasmic membrane proton motive force is required to promote immunity protein (Im9) release from the colicin E9/Im9 complex and colicin cell entry. We report here that engineering rigidity in the structured part of the colicin translocation domain via the introduction of disulfide bonds prevents immunity protein release from the colicin complex. Reduction of the disulfide bond by the addition of DTT leads to immunity protein release and resumption of activity. Similarly, the introduction of a disulfide bond in the DNase domain previously shown to abolish channel formation in planar bilayers also prevented immunity protein release. Importantly, all disulfide bonds, in the translocation as well as the DNase domain, also abolished the biological activity of the Im9-free colicin E9, the reduction of which led to a resumption of activity. Our results show, for the first time, that conformational flexibility in the structured translocation and DNase domains of a nuclease colicin is essential for immunity protein release, providing further evidence for the hypothesis that global structural rearrangement of the colicin molecule is required for disassembly of this high-affinity toxin-immunity protein complex prior to outer membrane translocation.",Bacteriocin;colicin;disulfide bond;Escherichia coli;translocation

In bacteria, mRNA degradation generally follows an “all-or-none” pattern. This implies that if control is to be efficient, it must occur at the initiating (and presumably rate-limiting) step of the degradation process. Studies of E. coli and B. subtilis, species separated by 3 billion years of evolution, have revealed the principal and very disparate enzymes involved in this process in the two organisms. The early view that mRNA decay in these two model organisms is radically different has given way to new models that can be resumed by “different enzymes—similar strategies”. The recent characterization of key ribonucleases sheds light on an impressive case of convergent evolution that illustrates that the surprisingly similar functions of these totally unrelated enzymes are of general importance to RNA metabolism in bacteria. We now know that the major mRNA decay pathways initiate with an endonucleolytic cleavage in E. coli and B. subtilis and probably in many of the currently known bacteria for which these organisms are considered representative. We will discuss here the different pathways of eubacterial mRNA decay, describe the major players and summarize the events that can precede and/or favor nucleolytic inactivation of a mRNA, notably the role of the 5′ end and translation initiation. Finally, we will discuss the role of subcellular compartmentalization of transcription, translation, and the RNA degradation machinery.",mRNA degradation;RNase E;RNase J;RNase Y;Gene expression;Prokaryote

This modality renders PrLDs prone to misfold into conformers that accrue in pathological inclusions that characterize various fatal neurodegenerative diseases. For example, TDP-43 and FUS form cytoplasmic inclusions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and mutations in TDP-43 and FUS can cause ALS. Here, we review our recent discovery of discrete missense mutations that alter a conserved gatekeeper aspartate residue in the PrLDs of hnRNPA2/B1 and hnRNPA1 and cause multisystem proteinopathy and ALS. The missense mutations generate potent steric zippers in the PrLDs, which enhance a natural propensity to form self-templating fibrils, promote recruitment to stress granules and drive cytoplasmic inclusion formation.

Similar to cellular proteins, post-translational modifications (PTMs) of HCV proteins are essential for proper protein function and regulation, thus, directly affecting viral life cycle and the generation of infectious virus particles. Cleavage of the HCV polyprotein by cellular and viral proteases into more than 10 proteins represents an early protein modification step after translation of the HCV positive-stranded RNA genome. The key modifications include the regulated intramembranous proteolytic cleavage of core protein, disulfide bond formation of core, glycosylation of HCV envelope proteins E1 and E2, methylation of nonstructural protein 3 (NS3), biotinylation of NS4A, ubiquitination of NS5B and phosphorylation of core and NS5B. Other modifications like ubiquitination of core and palmitoylation of core and NS4B proteins have been reported as well. For some modifications such as phosphorylation of NS3 and NS5A and acetylation of NS3, we have limited understanding of their effects on HCV replication and pathogenesis while the impact of other modifications is far from clear.

Of paramount importance for the success of any glycan-targeting reagent is the ability to specifically recognize the target among the plethora of different glycans that exist in the human body. The preeminent technique for defining specificity is glycan array screening, in which a glycan-binding protein (GBP) can be simultaneously screened against multiple glycans. Glycan array screening has provided unparalleled insight into GBP specificity, but data interpretation suffers from difficulties in identifying false-negative binding arising from altered glycan presentation, associated with the linker used to conjugate the glycan to the surface. In this work, we model the structure and dynamics of the linkers employed in the glycan arrays developed by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics. The modeling takes into account the physical presence and surface polarity of the array, and provides a structure-based rationalization of false-negative results arising from the so-called “linker effect.” The results also serve as a guide for interpreting glycan array screening data in a biological context; in particular, we show that attempts to employ natural amino acids as linkers may be prone to unexpected artifacts compromising glycan recognition.",glycan array screening;glycan-binding protein;glycan specificity;linker effects;molecular dynamics

However, competitive inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Hsp70 has proven challenging and, in some cases, may not be the most productive way to redirect Hsp70 function. Another approach is to inhibit Hsp70’s interactions with important co-chaperones, such as J proteins, nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain-containing proteins. These co-chaperones normally bind Hsp70 and guide its many diverse cellular activities. Complexes between Hsp70 and co-chaperones have been shown to have specific functions, such as pro-folding, pro-degradation and pro-trafficking. Thus, a promising strategy may be to block protein-protein interactions between Hsp70 and its co-chaperones or to target allosteric sites that disrupt these contacts. Such an approach might shift the balance of Hsp70 complexes and re-shape the proteome and it has the potential to restore healthy proteostasis. In this review, we discuss specific challenges and opportunities related to those goals. By pursuing Hsp70 complexes as drug targets, we might not only develop new leads for therapeutic development, but also discover new chemical probes for use in understanding Hsp70 biology.",heat shock protein 70;molecular chaperones;J proteins;nucleotide exchange factors;tetratricopeptide repeat-containing proteins;protein complex

P is a self-associated oligomer and forms complexes with the large viral polymerase protein (L), the nucleocapsid protein (N), and the assembled nucleocapsid. P from different viruses has shown structural diversities even though their essential functions are the same. We systematically mapped the domains in mumps virus (MuV) P and investigated their interactions with nucleocapsid-like particles (NLPs). Similar to other P proteins, MuV P contains N-terminal, central, and C-terminal domains with flexible linkers between neighboring domains. By pulldown assays, we discovered that in addition to the previously proposed nucleocapsid binding domain (residues 343 to 391), the N-terminal region of MuV P (residues 1 to 194) could also bind NLPs. Further analysis of binding kinetics was conducted using surface plasmon resonance. This is the first observation that both the N- and C-terminal regions of a negative-strand RNA virus P are involved in binding the nucleocapsid. In addition, we defined the oligomerization domain (POD) of MuV P as residues 213 to 277 and determined its crystal structure. The tetrameric MuV POD is formed by one pair of long parallel α-helices with another pair in opposite orientation. Unlike the parallel orientation of each α-helix in the tetramer of Sendai virus POD, this represents a novel orientation of a POD where both the N- and the C-terminal domains are at either end of the tetramer. This is consistent with the observation that both the N- and the C-terminal domains are involved in binding the nucleocapsid.",

For example, shift work has been associated with an increased risk of irregular menstrual cycles, endometriosis, infertility, miscarriage, low birth weight or pre-term delivery, and reduced incidence of breastfeeding. Based on what is known about circadian regulation of endocrine rhythms in rodents (and much less in humans), the circadian clock is an integral regulatory part of the reproductive system. When this 24-h program is disordered by environmental perturbation (such as shift work) or genetic alterations, the endocrine system can be impaired. The purpose of this review is to explore the hypothesis that misalignment of reproductive hormones with the environmental light-dark cycle and/or sleep-wake rhythms can disrupt menstrual cycles, pregnancy, and parturition. We highlight the role of the circadian clock in regulating human reproductive physiology and shift work-induced pathology within each step of the reproductive axis while exploring potential mechanisms from the animal model literature. In addition to documenting the reproductive hazards of shift work, we also point out important gaps in our knowledge as critical areas for future investigation. For example, future studies should examine whether forced desynchronization disrupts gonadotropin secretion rhythms and whether there are sleep/wake schedules that are better or worse for the adaptation of the reproductive system to shift work. These studies are necessary in order to define not only whether or not shift work-induced circadian misalignment impairs reproductive capacity, but also to identify strategies for the future that can minimize this desynchronization.",endocrinology;pregnancy failure;misalignment;sleep;circadian disruption;infertility

This review focuses on TFs from seven major TF families, known to play functional roles in response to abiotic stresses, including drought, high salinity, high osmolarity, temperature extremes and the phytohormone ABA. Although ectopic expression of several TFs has improved abiotic stress tolerance in plants, fine-tuning of TF expression and protein levels remains a challenge to avoid crop yield loss. To further our understanding of TFs in abiotic stress responses, emerging gene regulatory networks based on TFs and their direct targets genes are presented. These revealed components shared between ABA-dependent and independent signaling as well as abiotic and biotic stress signaling. Protein structure analysis suggested that TFs hubs of large interactomes have extended regions with protein intrinsic disorder (ID), referring to their lack of fixed tertiary structures. ID is now an emerging topic in plant science. Furthermore, the importance of the ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation systems and modification by sumoylation is also apparent from the interactomes. Therefore; TF interaction partners such as E3 ubiquitin ligases and TF regions with ID represent future targets for engineering improved abiotic stress tolerance in crops.",abiotic stress;transcription factor;gene regulatory network;interactome;protein intrinsic disorder;genetic engineering of crops

The current Plasma Peptide Atlas provides evidence on which peptides have been detected for every protein confidently identified in plasma; there are links to their spectra and their estimated abundance, facilitating the planning of targeted proteomics for biomarker studies. The Human Proteome Project (HPP) combines a chromosome-centric C-HPP with a biology and disease-driven B/D-HPP, upon a foundation of mass spectrometry, antibody, and knowledgebase resource pillars. The HPP aims to identify the approximately 7000 “missing proteins” and to characterize all proteins and their many isoforms. Success will enable the larger research community to utilize newly-available peptides, spectra, informative MS transitions, and databases for targeted analyses of priority proteins for each organ and disease. Among the isoforms of proteins, splice variants have the special feature of greatly enlarging protein diversity without enlarging the genome; evidence is accumulating of striking differential expression of splice variants in cancers.

It is essential for replication and amplification of the viral episome in the nucleus of infected cells. To do so, E1 assembles into a double-hexamer at the viral origin, unwinds DNA at the origin and ahead of the replication fork and interacts with cellular DNA replication factors. Biochemical and structural studies have revealed the assembly pathway of E1 at the origin and how the enzyme unwinds DNA using a spiral escalator mechanism. E1 is tightly regulated in vivo, in particular by post-translational modifications that restrict its accumulation in the nucleus. Here we review how different functional domains of E1 orchestrate viral DNA replication, with an emphasis on their interactions with substrate DNA, host DNA replication factors and modifying enzymes. These studies have made E1 one of the best characterized helicases and provided unique insights on how PVs usurp different host-cell machineries to replicate and amplify their genome in a tightly controlled manner.",Papillomavirus;E1;DNA replication;Helicase;ATPase;Post-translational modifications;Phosphoryaltion;Episome

Cranford,"Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Northeastern University, 400 Snell Engineering Center, 360 Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA;e-mail: ude.uen@drofnarc.s","Can naturally arising disorder in biological materials be beneficial? Materials scientists are continuously attempting to replicate the exemplary performance of materials such as spider silk, with detailed techniques and assembly procedures. At the same time, a spider does not precisely machine silk—imaging indicates that its fibrils are heterogeneous and irregular in cross section. While past investigations either focused on the building material (e.g. the molecular scale protein sequence and behaviour) or on the ultimate structural component (e.g. silk threads and spider webs), the bundled structure of fibrils that compose spider threads has been frequently overlooked. Herein, I exploit a molecular dynamics-based coarse-grain model to construct a fully three-dimensional fibril bundle, with a length on the order of micrometres. I probe the mechanical behaviour of bundled silk fibrils with variable density of heterogenic protrusions or globules, ranging from ideally homogeneous to a saturated distribution. Subject to stretching, the model indicates that cooperativity is enhanced by contact through low-force deformation and shear ‘locking’ between globules, increasing shear stress transfer by up to 200 per cent. In effect, introduction of a random and disordered structure can serve to improve mechanical performance. Moreover, addition of globules allows a tuning of free volume, and thus the wettability of silk (with implications for supercontraction). These findings support the ability of silk to maintain near-molecular-level strength at the scale of silk threads, and the mechanism could be easily adopted as a strategy for synthetic fibres.",computational mechanics;spider silk;fibre bundles;strength;shear transfer;free volume

To overcome the challenge of disorder in the imaged structures, we analyze each image individually, avoiding information loss through clustering or averaging. The Bayesian inference of EM (BioEM) method uses a likelihood-based probabilistic measure to quantify the consistency between each EM image and given structural models. The likelihood function accounts for uncertainties in the molecular position and orientation, variations in the relative intensities and noise in the experimental images. The BioEM formalism is physically intuitive and mathematically simple. We show that for experimental GroEL images, BioEM correctly identifies structures according to the functional state. The top-ranked structure is the corresponding X-ray crystal structure, followed by an EM structure generated previously from a superset of the EM images used here. To analyze EM images of highly flexible molecules, we propose an ensemble refinement procedure, and validate it with synthetic EM maps of the ESCRT-I-II supercomplex. Both the size of the ensemble and its structural members are identified correctly. BioEM offers an alternative to 3D-reconstruction methods, extracting accurate population distributions for highly flexible structures and their assemblies. We discuss limitations of the method, and possible applications beyond ensemble refinement, including the cross-validation and unbiased post-assessment of model structures, aand the structural characterization of systems where traditional approaches fail. Overall, our results suggest that the BioEM framework can be used to analyze EM images of both ordered and disordered molecular systems.",

Its inactivation by mutation or oncogenic viruses is required for cellular transformation and eventually carcinogenesis. The high conservation of the Rb cyclin fold prompted us to investigate the link between conformational stability and ligand binding properties of the RbAB pocket domain. RbAB unfolding presents a three-state transition involving cooperative secondary and tertiary structure changes and a partially folded intermediate that can oligomerize. The first transition corresponds to unfolding of the metastable B subdomain containing the binding site for the LXCXE motif present in cellular and viral targets, and the second transition corresponds to the stable A subdomain. The low thermodynamic stability of RbAB translates into a propensity to rapidly oligomerize and aggregate at 37 °C (T50 = 28 min) that is suppressed by human papillomavirus E7 and E2F peptide ligands, suggesting that Rb is likely stabilized in vivo through binding to target proteins. We propose that marginal stability and associated oligomerization may be conserved for function as a “hub” protein, allowing the formation of multiprotein complexes, which could constitute a robust mechanism to retain its cell cycle regulatory role throughout evolution. Decreased stability and oligomerization are shared with the p53 tumor suppressor, suggesting a link between folding and function in these two essential cell regulators that are inactivated in most cancers and operate within multitarget signaling pathways.",Protein Aggregation;Protein Folding;Protein Misfolding;Protein Stability;Retinoblastoma (Rb);Scaffold Proteins;Cyclin Fold;Marginal Stability;Oligomerization;Tumor Suppressor

We find by cDNA microarray analysis enrichment for maternal mRNAs encoding spindle and other proteins on the mouse oocyte metaphase II (MII) spindle. We also find that the key translational regulator, EIF4EBP1, undergoes a dynamic and complex spatially regulated pattern of phosphorylation at sites that regulate its association with EIF4E and its ability to repress translation. These phosphorylation variants appear at different positions along the spindle at different stages of meiosis. These results indicate that dynamic spatially restricted patterns of EIF4EBP1 phosphorylation may promote localized mRNA translation to support spindle formation, maintenance, function, and other nearby processes. Regulated EIF4EBP1 phosphorylation at the spindle may help coordinate spindle formation with progression through the cell cycle. The discovery that EIF4EBP1 may be part of an overall mechanism that integrates and couples cell cycle progression to mRNA translation and subsequent spindle formation and function may be relevant to understanding mechanisms leading to diminished oocyte quality, and potential means of avoiding such defects. The localization of maternal mRNAs at the spindle is evolutionarily conserved between mammals and other vertebrates and is also seen in mitotic cells, indicating that EIF4EBP1 control of localized mRNA translation is likely key to correct segregation of genetic material across cell types.",translational control;localized maternal mRNA;meiosis;spindle;Microarray;protein phosphorylation;cell cycle

In this report, we describe the existence of a MYC-protein kinase A (PKA)-polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) signaling loop in cells. We report that sequential MYC phosphorylation by PKA and PLK1 protects MYC from proteasome-mediated degradation. Interestingly, short term pan-PKA inhibition diminishes MYC level, whereas prolonged PKA catalytic subunit α (PKACα) knockdown, but not PKA catalytic subunit β (PKACβ) knockdown, increases MYC. We show that the short term effect of pan-PKA inhibition on MYC is post-translational and the PKACα-specific long term effect on MYC is transcriptional. These data also reveal distinct functional roles among PKA catalytic isoforms in MYC regulation. We attribute this effect to differential phosphorylation selectivity among PKA catalytic subunits, which we demonstrate for multiple substrates. Further, we also show that MYC up-regulates PKACβ, transcriptionally forming a proximate positive feedback loop. These results establish PKA as a regulator of MYC and highlight the distinct biological roles of the different PKA catalytic subunits.",Cancer Biology;MYC;Phosphorylation;Post-translational Modification;Protein Kinase A (PKA);Polo-like Kinase 1 (PLK1)

Gene expression analysis of four different tissues in each of the Hmgntm1/tm1 lines reveals very little overlap between genes affected by specific variants in different tissues. Pathway analysis reveals that loss of an HMGN variant subtly affects expression of numerous genes in specific biological processes.

This study used computational methods to characterize the VP1 sequence for adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotypes 1 to 12 and circular dichroism and electron microscopy to monitor conformational changes in the AAV1 capsid induced by temperature and the pHs encountered during trafficking through the endocytic pathway. Circular dichroism was also used to monitor conformational changes in AAV6 capsids assembled from VP2 and VP3 or VP1, VP2, and VP3 at pH 7.5. VP1u was predicted (computationally) and confirmed (in solution) to be structurally ordered. This VP domain was observed to undergo a reversible pH-induced unfolding/refolding process, a loss/gain of α-helical structure, which did not disrupt the capsid integrity and is likely facilitated by its difference in isoelectric point compared to the other VP sequences assembling the capsid. This study is the first to physically document conformational changes in the VP1u region that likely facilitate its externalization from the capsid interior during infection and establishes the order of events in the escape of the AAV capsid from the endosome en route to the nucleus.",

Collins: vog.hin.diain@snillocp ","Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an enveloped, nonsegmented negative-strand RNA virus of family Paramyxoviridae. RSV is the most complex member of the family in terms of the number of genes and proteins. It is also relatively divergent and distinct from the prototype members of the family. In the past 30 years, we have seen a tremendous increase in our understanding of the molecular biology of RSV based on a succession of advances involving molecular cloning, reverse genetics, and detailed studies of protein function and structure. Much remains to be learned. RSV disease is complex and variable, and the host and viral factors that determine tropism and disease are poorly understood. RSV is notable for a historic vaccine failure in the 1960s involving a formalin-inactivated vaccine that primed for enhanced disease in RSV naïve recipients. Live vaccine candidates have been shown to be free of this complication. However, development of subunit or other protein-based vaccines for pediatric use is hampered by the possibility of enhanced disease and the difficulty of reliably demonstrating its absence in preclinical studies.",

","Although protein quality control (PQC) is generally perceived as important for the development of the nervous system, the specific mechanisms of neuronal PQC have remained poorly understood. Here, we report that C. elegans EBAX-1 (Elongin BC-Binding AXon regulator), a conserved BC-box protein, regulates axon guidance through PQC of the SAX-3/Robo receptor. EBAX-1 buffers guidance errors against temperature variations. As a substrate-recognition subunit in the Elongin BC-containing Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL), EBAX-1 also binds to DAF-21, a cytosolic Hsp90 chaperone. The EBAX-type CRL and DAF-21 collaboratively regulate SAX-3-mediated axon pathfinding. Biochemical and imaging assays indicate that EBAX-1 specifically recognizes misfolded SAX-3 and promotes its degradation in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, vertebrate EBAX also shows substrate preference towards aberrant Robo3 implicated in horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS). Together, our findings demonstrate a triage PQC mechanism mediated by the EBAX-type CRL and DAF-21/Hsp90 that maintains the accuracy of neuronal wiring.",Cullin;Elongin BC-containing ubiquitin ligase;EBAX-1;ZSWIM8;Hsp90;DAF-21;SAX-3;Robo;protein quality control;axon guidance

The intrinsically unstructured protein binds curved synaptic vesicle membranes in helical conformations but misfolds into amyloid fibrils via β-sheet interactions. Breaks in helical αS conformation may offer a pathway to transition from helical to sheet conformation. Here, we explore the evolution of broken αS helix conformations formed in complex with SDS and SLAS micelles by molecular dynamics simulations. The population distribution of experimentally observed αS conformations is related to the spatial concentration of intrinsic micelle shape perturbations. For the success of micelle-induced αS folding, we posit the length of the first helical segment formed, which controls micelle ellipticity, to be a key determinant. The degree of micelle curvature relates to the arrangement and segmental motions of helical secondary structure elements. A criterion for assessing the reproduction of such intermediate timescale protein dynamics is introduced by comparing the sampling of experimental and simulated spin label distributions. Finally, at the sites of breaks in the elongated, marginally stable αS helix, vulnerability to forming a transient, intramolecular β-sheet is identified. Upon subsequent intermolecular β-sheet pairing, pathological αS amyloid formation from initial helical conformation is thus achievable.",α-synuclein;micelle curvature;molecular dynamics simulation;protein-micelle interaction;protein misfolding

Mechanisms controlling FACT levels are of interest, since the complex is not expressed in most differentiated cells, but is frequently upregulated in cancer, particularly in poorly differentiated, aggressive tumors. Moreover, inhibition of FACT expression or function in tumor cells interferes with their survival. Here we demonstrate that SSRP1 and SPT16 protein levels decline upon induction of cellular differentiation or senescence in vitro and that similar declines in protein levels for both SSRP1 and SPT16 occur upon RNAi-mediated knockdown of either SSRP1 or SPT16. The interdependence of SSRP1 and SPT16 protein levels was found to be due to their association with SSRP1 and SPT16 mRNAs, which stabilizes the proteins. In particular, presence of SSRP1 mRNA is critical for SPT16 protein stability. In addition, binding of SSRP1 and SPT16 mRNAs to the FACT complex increases the stability and efficiency of translation of the mRNAs. These data support a model in which the FACT complex is stable when SSRP1 mRNA is present, but quickly degrades when SSRP1 mRNA levels drop. In the absence of FACT complex, SSRP1 and SPT16 mRNAs are unstable and inefficiently translated, making reactivation of FACT function unlikely in normal cells. Thus, we have described a complex and unusual mode of regulation controlling cellular FACT levels that results in amplified and stringent control of FACT activity. The FACT dependence of tumor cells suggests that mechanisms controlling FACT levels could be targeted for anticancer therapy.",FACT;SSRP1;SPT16;mRNA stability;protein stability

The two PDZ domains of NHERF1 possess very different ligand-binding capabilities: PDZ1 recognizes a variety of membrane proteins with high affinity, while PDZ2 only binds limited number of target proteins. Here using NMR, we have determined the structural and dynamic mechanisms that differentiate the binding affinities of the two PDZ domains, for the Type 1 PDZ-binding motif (QDTRL) in the carboxyl-terminus of CFTR. Similar to PDZ2, we have identified a helix-turn-helix subdomain coupled to the canonical PDZ1 domain. The extended PDZ1 domain is highly flexible with correlated backbone motions on fast and slow timescales, while the extended PDZ2 domain is relatively rigid. The malleability of the extended PDZ1 structure facilitates the transmission of conformational changes at the ligand-binding site to the remote helix-turn-helix extension. By contrast, ligand-binding has only modest effects on the conformation and dynamics of the extended PDZ2 domain. The study shows that ligand induced structural and dynamic changes coupled with sequence variation at the putative PDZ binding site dictate ligand selectivity and binding affinity of the two PDZ domains of NHERF1.",

We developed a nonequilibrium landscape–flux theory for asymmetrically connected neural networks. We found (pp. E4185–E4194) the landscape topography is critical in determining the global stability and function of the neural networks.

In order to calculate such effects in direct simulations of proteins mixed with bystander macromolecules, the latter (referred to as crowders) are usually modeled as spheres and the proteins represented at a coarse-grained level. Our recently developed postprocessing approach allows the proteins to be represented at the all-atom level but, for computational efficiency, has only been implemented for spherical crowders. Modeling crowder molecules in cellular environments and in vitro experiments as spheres may distort their effects on protein stability. Here we present a new method that is capable for treating aspherical crowders. The idea, borrowed from protein-protein docking, is to calculate the excess chemical potential of the proteins in crowded solution by fast Fourier transform (FFT). As the first application, we studied the effects of ellipsoidal crowders on the folding and binding free energies of all-atom proteins, and found, in agreement with previous direct simulations with coarse-grained protein models, that the aspherical crowders exert greater stabilization effects than spherical crowders of the same volume. Moreover, as demonstrated here, the FFT-based method has the important property that its computational cost does not increase strongly even when the level of details in representing the crowders is increased all the way to all-atom, thus significantly accelerating realistic modeling of protein folding and binding in cell-like environments.",

While some proteins naturally form these fibrils to serve functional roles, amyloid is usually associated with pathogenic processes in which specific proteins aberrantly aggregate within cells or tissues. Though the contribution of amyloid fibrils to actual disease pathogenesis is not always clear, one possibility is that the titration of essential proteins from solution into aggregates contributes to the cellular degeneration common to many amyloid diseases. Using mammalian and yeast model systems, we recently showed that the common biophysical properties of amyloid aggregates—including strong resistance to dissolution—enable stringent purification and identification of both amyloid-forming and amyloid-associated proteins directly from cells. Strikingly, many proteins that were previously implicated in formation or clearance of intracellular aggregates, including several stress granule components, were found to co-aggregate with amyloid formed by a polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin fragment.

We have defined the determinants of this recognition mechanism and discovered that CENP-C binds a hydrophobic region in the CENP-A tail and docks onto the acidic patch of histone H2A/H2B. We further find that the more broadly conserved CENP-C motif uses the same mechanism for CENP-A nucleosome recognition. Our findings reveal a conserved mechanism for protein recruitment to centromeres and a histone recognition mode whereby a disordered peptide binds the histone tail through nucleosome-docking-facilitated hydrophobic interactions.,

These pathological aggregates propagate into larger brain regions as the disease progresses, with the associated clinical symptoms becoming increasingly severe and complex. However, the factors that induce α-synuclein aggregation and spreading of the aggregates remain elusive. Herein, we have evaluated the effects of the major lipid peroxidation byproduct 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) on α-synuclein oligomerization and cell-to-cell transmission of this protein. Results: Incubation with HNE promoted the oligomerization of recombinant human α-synuclein via adduct formation at the lysine and histidine residues. HNE-induced α-synuclein oligomers evidence a little β-sheet structure and are distinct from amyloid fibrils at both conformation and ultrastructure levels. Nevertheless, the HNE-induced oligomers are capable of seeding the amyloidogenesis of monomeric α-synuclein under in vitro conditions. When neuronal cells were treated with HNE, both the translocation of α-synuclein into vesicles and the release of this protein from cells were increased. Neuronal cells can internalize HNE-modified α-synuclein oligomers, and HNE treatment increased the cell-to-cell transfer of α-synuclein proteins. Innovation and Conclusion: These results indicate that HNE induces the oligomerization of α-synuclein through covalent modification and promotes the cell-to-cell transfer of seeding-capable oligomers, thereby contributing to both the initiation and spread of α-synuclein aggregates.

Using cryo-electron microscopy and light scattering, we found that αS can remodel phosphatidylglycerol vesicles into nanoparticles whose shape (ellipsoidal) and dimensions (in the 7–10-nm range) resemble those formed by apolipoproteins. The molar ratio of αS to lipid in nanoparticles is ∼1:20, and αS is oligomeric (including trimers and tetramers). Similar nanoparticles form when αS is added to vesicles of mitochondrial lipids. This observation suggests a mechanism for the previously reported disruption of mitochondrial membranes by αS. Circular dichroism and four-pulse double electron electron resonance experiments revealed that in nanoparticles αS assumes a broken helical conformation distinct from the extended helical conformation adopted when αS is bound to intact vesicles or membrane tubules. We also observed αS-dependent tubule and nanoparticle formation in the presence of oleic acid, implying that αS can interact with fatty acids and lipids in a similar manner. αS-related nanoparticles might play a role in lipid and fatty acid transport functions previously attributed to this protein.",α-Synuclein;Electron Microscopy (EM);Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR);Membrane Proteins;Neurodegenerative Diseases;Nanoparticles

The pathway followed by PEX5 during this process is known with reasonable detail. After recognizing cargo proteins in the cytosol, the receptor interacts with the peroxisomal docking/translocation machinery, where it gets inserted; PEX5 is then monoubiquitinated, extracted back to the cytosol and, finally, deubiquitinated. However, despite this information, the exact step of this pathway where cargo proteins are translocated across the organelle membrane is still ill-defined. In this work, we used an in vitro import system to characterize the translocation mechanism of a matrix protein possessing a type 1 targeting signal. Our results suggest that translocation of proteins across the organelle membrane occurs downstream of a reversible docking step and upstream of the first cytosolic ATP-dependent step (i.e. before ubiquitination of PEX5), concomitantly with the insertion of the receptor into the docking/translocation machinery.",Peroxisomes;Protein Sorting;Protein Translocation;Subcellular Organelles;Ubiquitination;PEX5;PTS1 Protein;In Vitro Import Assays

The crowded cytoplasm excludes about a third of the volume available to macromolecules in dilute solution. This excluded volume is the sum of two parts: steric repulsions and chemical interactions, also called soft interactions. Until recently, most efforts to understand crowding have focused on steric repulsions. Here, we summarize the results and conclusions from recent studies on macromolecular crowding, emphasizing the contribution of soft interactions to the equilibrium thermodynamics of protein stability. Despite their non-specific and weak nature, the large number of soft interactions present under many crowded conditions can sometimes overcome the stabilizing steric, excluded volume effect.",Crowding;Excluded volume;Osmolytes;Protein stability;Second virial coefficient;Synthetic polymers

Here, we have modeled the effect of NTRs on polymeric structure in the nanopore confinement of the NPC central conduit. The model explicitly takes into account inter- and intramolecular interactions, as well as the finite size of the NTRs (∼20% of the NPC channel diameter). It reproduces various proposed scenarios for the channel structure, ranging from a central polymer condensate (selective phase) to brushlike polymer arrangements localized at the channel wall (virtual gate, reduction of dimensionality), with the transport receptors lining the polymer surface. In addition, it predicts a new structure in which NTRs become an integral part of the transport barrier by forming a cross-linked network with the unstructured proteins stretching across the pore. The model provides specific and distinctive predictions for the equilibrium spatial distributions of NTRs for these different scenarios that can be experimentally verified by, e.g., superresolution fluorescence microscopy. Moreover, it suggests mechanisms by which globular macromolecules (colloidal particles) can cause polymer-coated nanopores to switch between open and closed configurations, a possible explanation of the biological function of the NPC, and suggests potential technological applications for filtration and single-molecule sensing.",

The extent of nitrosylation of a given cysteine residue is governed by the equilibrium between nitrosylation and denitrosylation reactions. The mechanisms of these reactions remain poorly studied in plants. In this study, we have employed glycolytic GAPDH from Arabidopsis thaliana as a tool to investigate the molecular mechanisms of nitrosylation and denitrosylation using a combination of approaches, including activity assays, the biotin switch technique, site-directed mutagenesis, and mass spectrometry. Arabidopsis GAPDH activity was reversibly inhibited by nitrosylation of catalytic Cys-149 mediated either chemically with a strong NO donor or by trans-nitrosylation with GSNO. GSNO was found to trigger both GAPDH nitrosylation and glutathionylation, although nitrosylation was widely prominent. Arabidopsis GAPDH was found to be denitrosylated by GSH but not by plant cytoplasmic thioredoxins. GSH fully converted nitrosylated GAPDH to the reduced, active enzyme, without forming any glutathionylated GAPDH. Thus, we found that nitrosylation of GAPDH is not a step toward formation of the more stable glutathionylated enzyme. GSH-dependent denitrosylation of GAPC1 was found to be linked to the [GSH]/[GSNO] ratio and to be independent of the [GSH]/[GSSG] ratio. The possible importance of these biochemical properties for the regulation of Arabidopsis GAPDH functions in vivo is discussed.",Arabidopsis;Glutathionylation;Nitrosylation;Redox Signaling;Thioredoxin;Denitrosylation;Glutathione;Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate Dehydrogenase

Unlike other multishelled reoviruses, cypovirus has a single-layered capsid, thereby representing a simplified model for studying vRNA replication of reoviruses. VP5 is one of the three major cypovirus capsid proteins and functions as a clamp protein to stabilize cypovirus capsid. Here, we expressed VP5 from type 5 Helicoverpa armigera cypovirus (HaCPV-5) in a eukaryotic system and determined that this VP5 possesses RNA chaperone-like activity, which destabilizes RNA helices and accelerates strand annealing independent of ATP. Our further characterization of VP5 revealed that its helix-destabilizing activity is RNA specific, lacks directionality and could be inhibited by divalent ions, such as Mg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+ or Zn2+, to varying degrees. Furthermore, we found that HaCPV-5 VP5 facilitates the replication initiation of an alternative polymerase (i.e. reverse transcriptase) through a panhandle-structured RNA template, which mimics the 5′-3′ cyclization of cypoviral positive-stranded RNA. Given that the replication of negative-stranded vRNA on the positive-stranded vRNA template necessitates the dissociation of the 5′-3′ panhandle, the RNA chaperone activity of VP5 may play a direct role in the initiation of reoviral dsRNA synthesis.",

A facilitated diffusion process in which a DBP combines three-dimensional diffusion in solution with one-dimensional sliding along DNA has been suggested to explain how proteins can locate their target sites on DNA much faster than predicted by three-dimensional diffusion alone. Although experimental and theoretical studies have recently advanced understanding of the biophysical principles underlying the search mechanism, the process under in vivo cellular conditions is poorly understood. In this study, we used various computational approaches to explore how the presence of obstacle proteins on the DNA influences search efficiency. At a low obstacle occupancy (i.e., when few obstacles occupy sites on the DNA), sliding by the searching DBP may be confined, which may impair search efficiency. The obstacles, however, can be bypassed during hopping events, and the number of bypasses is larger for higher obstacle occupancies. Dynamism on the part of the obstacles may even further facilitate search kinetics. Our study shows that the nature and efficiency of the search process may be governed not only by the intrinsic properties of the DBP and the salt concentration of the medium, but also by the in vivo association of DNA with other macromolecular obstacles, their location, and occupancy.",

Inhibition of Hsp90 and Hsc70, two major molecular chaperones, has led to a greater understanding of how chaperone triage decisions are made and how perturbing the chaperone system can promote clearance of these pathogenic clients. Described here are major pathways and components of several prominent neurological disorders. Also discussed is how treatment with chaperone inhibitors, predominately Hsp90 inhibitors which are selective for a diseased state, can relieve the burden of aberrant client signaling in these neurological disorders.",Neurodegeneration;Molecular chaperones;Aberrant neurological proteins;Chaperone inhibitors

An important role of Rad52 in HR is the loading of Rad51 onto replication protein A-coated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which is referred to as the recombination mediator activity. In vitro, Rad52 displays additional activities, including self-association, DNA binding and ssDNA annealing. Although Rad52 has been a subject of extensive genetic, biochemical and structural studies, the mechanisms by which these activities are coordinated in the various roles of Rad52 in HR remain largely unknown. In the present study, we found that an isolated C-terminal half of Rad52 disrupted the Rad51 oligomer and formed a heterodimeric complex with Rad51. The Rad52 fragment inhibited the binding of Rad51 to double-stranded DNA, but not to ssDNA. The phenylalanine-349 and tyrosine-409 residues present in the C-terminal half of Rad52 were critical for the interaction with Rad51, the disruption of Rad51 oligomers, the mediator activity of the full-length protein and for DNA repair in vivo in the presence of methyl methanesulfonate. Our studies suggested that phenylalanine-349 and tyrosine-409 are key residues in the C-terminal half of Rad52 and probably play an important role in the mediator activity.",

Here we elucidate molecular events at synapses that cause this plasticity and the resulting behavioral response to cocaine in mice. In response to D1 dopamine receptor signaling that is induced by drug administration, the glutamate receptor protein mGluR5 is phosphorylated by MAP kinase, which we show potentiates Pin1-mediated prolyl isomerization of mGluR5 in instances where the product of an activity-dependent gene, Homer1a, is present to enable Pin1-mGluR5 interaction. These biochemical events potentiate NMDA receptor-mediated currents that underlie synaptic plasticity and cocaine-evoked motor sensitization as tested in mice with relevant mutations. The findings elucidate how a coincidence of signals from the nucleus and the synapse can render mGluR5 accessible to activation with consequences for drug-induced dopamine responses, and point to depotentiation at corticostriatal synapses as a possible therapeutic target for treating addiction.",

The protein is involved in the transport of microcins B17 and J25, bleomycin, proline-rich antimicrobial peptides, antisense peptide phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers, and peptide nucleic acids into the Escherichia coli cytoplasm. The sbmA homologue is found in a variety of bacteria, though the physiological role of the protein is hitherto unknown. In this work, we carried out a functional and structural analysis to determine which amino acids are critical for the transport properties of SbmA. We created a set of 15 site-directed sbmA mutants in which single conserved amino acids were replaced by glycine residues. Our work demonstrated that strains carrying the site-directed mutants V102G, F219G, and E276G had a null phenotype for SbmA transport functions. In contrast, strains carrying the single point mutants W19G, W53G, F60G, S69G, N155G, R190, L233G, A344G, T255G, N308G, and R385G showed transport capacities indistinguishable from those of strains harboring a wild-type sbmA. The strain carrying the Y116G mutant exhibited mixed phenotypic characteristics. We also demonstrated that those sbmA mutants with severely impaired transport capacity showed a dominant negative phenotype. Electron microscopy data and in silico three-dimensional (3D) homology modeling support the idea that SbmA forms a homodimeric complex, closely resembling the membrane-spanning region of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family. Direct mapping of the sbmA single point mutants on the protein surface allowed us to explain the observed phenotypic differences in transport ability.",

Widespread differences between mature and pre-30S complexes in the absence of assembly factors RbfA and RimM revealed global reorganization of RNA-protein interactions prior to maturation of the 16S rRNA and showed how RimM reduces misfolding of the 16S 3′ domain during transcription in vivo.

We previously demonstrated the ability to trigger enamel differentiation and regeneration in the embryonic mouse incisor using a self-assembling matrix that displayed the integrin-binding epitope RGDS (Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser). To further elucidate the intracellular signaling pathways responsible for this phenomenon, we explore here the coupling response of integrin receptors to the biomaterial and subsequent downstream gene expression profiles. We demonstrate that the artificial matrix activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK) to increase phosphorylation of both c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and its downstream transcription factor c-Jun (c-Jun). Inhibition of FAK blocked activation of the identified matrix-mediated pathways, while independent inhibition of JNK nearly abolished phosphorylated-c-Jun (p-c-Jun) and attenuated the pathways identified to promote enamel regeneration. Cognate binding sites in the amelogenin promoter were identified to be transcriptionally up-regulated in response to p-c-Jun. Furthermore, the artificial matrix induced gene expression to specifically increase the abundance of amelogenin, the main protein expressed during enamel formation, and the CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPα), which is the known activator of amelogenin expression. Elucidating these cues not only provides guidelines for the design of synthetic regenerative strategies and opportunities to manipulate pathways to regulate enamel regeneration, but can provide insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in tissue formation.",

These two resistance proteins could thus mediate resistance against M. fijiensis if genetically transformed into banana (Musa spp.). However, disease resistance controlled by single dominant genes can be overcome by mutated effector alleles, whose products are not recognized by the cognate resistance proteins. Here, we surveyed the allelic variation within the MfAvr4, MfEcp2, MfEcp2‐2 and MfEcp2‐3 effector genes of M. fijiensis in a global population of the pathogen, and assayed its impact on recognition by the tomato Cf‐4 and Cf‐Ecp2 resistance proteins, respectively. We identified a large number of polymorphisms that could reflect a co‐evolutionary arms race between host and pathogen. The analysis of nucleotide substitution patterns suggests that both positive selection and intragenic recombination have shaped the evolution of M. fijiensis effectors. Clear differences in allelic diversity were observed between strains originating from South‐East Asia relative to strains from other banana‐producing continents, consistent with the hypothesis that M. fijiensis originated in the Asian‐Pacific region. Furthermore, transient co‐expression of the MfAvr4 effector alleles and the tomato Cf‐4 resistance gene, as well as of MfEcp2, MfEcp2‐2 and MfEcp2‐3 and the putative Cf‐Ecp2 resistance gene, indicated that effector alleles able to overcome these resistance genes are already present in natural populations of the pathogen, thus questioning the durability of resistance that can be provided by these genes in the field.",

They generally act as ATP-independent chaperones to bind and stabilize denaturing proteins that can be later reactivated by ATP-dependent Hsp70/DnaK, but the mechanism of substrate capture by sHSPs remains poorly understood. A majority of sHSPs form large oligomers, a property that has been linked to their effective chaperone action. We describe AtHsp18.5 from Arabidopsis thaliana, demonstrating it is dimeric and exhibits robust chaperone activity, adding support to the model that suboligomeric sHSP forms are a substrate binding species. Notably, like oligomeric sHSPs, when bound to substrate AtHsp18.5 assembles into large complexes, indicating reformation of sHSP oligomeric contacts are not required for assembly of sHSP-substrate complexes. Monomers of AtHsp18.5 freely exchange between dimers, but fail to coassemble in vitro with dodecameric plant cytosolic sHSPs, suggesting AtHsp18.5 does not interact by coassembly with these other sHSPs in vivo. Data from controlled proteolysis and hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry show that the N- and C-termini of AtHsp18.5 are highly accessible and lack stable secondary structure, most likely a requirement for substrate interaction. Chaperone activity of a series of AtHsp18.5 truncation mutants confirm that the N-terminal arm is required for substrate protection and that different substrates interact differently with the N-terminal arm. In total, these data imply that the core α-crystallin domain of the sHSPs is a platform for flexible arms that capture substrates to maintain their solubility.",chaperone;α-crystallin domain;protein flexibility;subunit exchange;hydrogen deuterium exchange;mass spectrometry of protein complexes

Mutant forms of Cx37 with nonfunctional channels but normally localized, wild-type carboxy termini are not growth suppressive. Here we determined whether the carboxy-terminal (CT) domain is required for Cx37-mediated growth suppression and whether the Cx37 pore-forming domain can be replaced with the Cx43 pore-forming domain and still retain growth-suppressive properties. We show that despite forming functional gap junction channels and hemichannels, Cx37 with residues subsequent to 273 replaced with a V5-epitope tag (Cx37–273tr*V5) had no effect on the proliferation of Rin cells, did not facilitate G1-cell cycle arrest with serum deprivation, and did not prolong cell cycle time comparably to the wild-type protein. The chimera Cx43*CT37, comprising the pore-forming domain of Cx43 and CT of Cx37, also did not suppress proliferation, despite forming functional gap junctions with a permselective profile similar to wild-type Cx37. Differences in channel behavior of both Cx37–273tr*V5 and Cx43*CT37 relative to their wild-type counterparts and failure of the Cx37-CT to interact as the Cx43-CT does with the Cx43 cytoplasmic loop suggest that the Cx37-CT and pore-forming domains are both essential to growth suppression by Cx37.",connexin;gap junction channel;growth suppression;protein interactome;endothelium

Receptor-cargo docking occurs at the membrane-associated protein Pex14. In human cells, this interaction is mediated by seven conserved diaromatic penta-peptide motifs (WXXX(F/Y) motifs) in the N-terminal half of Pex5 and the N-terminal domain of Pex14. A systematic screening of a Pex5 peptide library by ligand blot analysis revealed a novel Pex5-Pex14 interaction site of Pex5. The novel motif composes the sequence LVAEF with the evolutionarily conserved consensus sequence LVXEF. Replacement of the amino acid LVAEF sequence by alanines strongly affects matrix protein import into peroxisomes in vivo. The NMR structure of a complex of Pex5-(57–71) with the Pex14-N-terminal domain showed that the novel motif binds in a similar α-helical orientation as the WXXX(F/Y) motif but that the tryptophan pocket is now occupied by a leucine residue. Surface plasmon resonance analyses revealed 33 times faster dissociation rates for the LVXEF ligand when compared with a WXXX(F/Y) motif. Surprisingly, substitution of the novel motif with the higher affinity WXXX(F/Y) motif impairs protein import into peroxisomes. These data indicate that the distinct kinetic properties of the novel Pex14-binding site in Pex5 are important for processing of the peroxisomal targeting signal 1 receptor at the peroxisomal membrane. The novel Pex14-binding site may represent the initial tethering site of Pex5 from which the cargo-loaded receptor is further processed in a sequential manner.",Peroxisomes;Protein Dynamics;Protein Motifs;Protein Structure;Protein Targeting;Protein-Protein Interactions;Subcellular Organelles

Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic Ku homologues have been characterized and shown to bind DNA ends. A unique feature of Mycobacterium smegmatis Ku is its basic C-terminal tail that contains several lysine-rich low-complexity PAKKA repeats that are absent from homologues encoded by obligate parasitic mycobacteria. Such PAKKA repeats are also characteristic of mycobacterial Hlp (histone-like protein) for which they have been shown to confer the ability to appose DNA ends. Unexpectedly, removal of the lysine-rich extension enhances DNA-binding affinity, but an interaction between DNA and the PAKKA repeats is indicated by the observation that only full-length Ku forms multiple complexes with a short stem-loop-containing DNA previously designed to accommodate only one Ku dimer. The C-terminal extension promotes DNA end-joining by T4 DNA ligase, suggesting that the PAKKA repeats also contribute to efficient end-joining. We suggest that low-complexity lysine-rich sequences have evolved repeatedly to modulate the function of unrelated DNA-binding proteins.",DNA binding;electrophoretic mobility-shift assay;Ku protein;low-complexity repeats;non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)

In this work, bulk assays of DNA replication were used to uncover a non-proofreading activity of ɛ. Combination of mutagenesis with biophysical studies and single-molecule leading-strand replication assays traced this activity to a novel β-binding site in ɛ that, in conjunction with the site in α, maintains a closed state of the αɛθ–β2 replicase in the polymerization mode of DNA synthesis.

NS5A comprises three domains, separated by low-complexity sequences. Whilst the function of domain I appears to be predominantly involved with genome replication, the roles of domains II and III are less well defined. It has been reported previously that a deletion spanning the majority of domain II but retaining the C-terminal 35 residues had no effect on virus production; however, deletion of the entire domain II eliminated genome replication, pointing to a key role for the C terminus of this domain. Recent work has also highlighted this region as the potential binding site of the host factor cyclophilin A (CypA). To define this requirement for replication in more detail, and to investigate the involvement of CypA, we conducted a mutagenic study of the C-terminal 30 residues of domain II within the context of both the infectious JFH-1 virus and a JFH-1-derived subgenomic replicon. We showed that 12 of these residues were absolutely required for virus genome replication, whilst mutations of the remainder either had no phenotype or exhibited a partial reduction in genome replication. There was an absolute correlation between the datasets for virus and subgenomic replicon, indicating that this region is involved solely in the process of genome replication. Comparison of our data with a previously published analysis of the same region in genotype 1b revealed some important differences between the two genotypes of HCV.",

Most yeast prions are amyloid forms of normally soluble proteins, and a single protein sequence can have any of several self-propagating forms (called prion strains or variants), analogous to the different possible alleles of a DNA gene. A central issue in prion biology is the structural basis of this conformational templating process. The in-register parallel beta sheet structure found for several infectious yeast prion amyloids naturally suggests an explanation for this conformational templating. While most prions are plainly diseases, the [Het-s] prion of Podospora anserina may be a functional amyloid, with important structural implications. Yeast prions are important models for human amyloid diseases in general, particularly since new evidence is showing infectious aspects of several human amyloidoses not previously classified as prions. We also review studies of the roles of chaperones, aggregate-collecting proteins, and other cellular components using yeast that have led the way in understanding similar processes which must be operating in many human amyloidoses.",

However, we found L7 to be a highly specific component of Rlp7-associated complexes, revealing that the two proteins can bind simultaneously to pre-ribosomal particles. Cross-linking and cDNA analysis experiments showed that Rlp7 binds to the ITS2 region of 27S pre-rRNAs, at two sites, in helix III and in a region adjacent to the pre-rRNA processing sites C1 and E. However, L7 binds to mature 25S and 5S rRNAs and cross-linked predominantly to helix ES7Lb within 25S rRNA.

","Splicing of pre-mRNAs in eukaryotes is catalyzed by the spliceosome a large RNA–protein metalloenzyme. The catalytic center of the spliceosome involves a structure comprised of the U2 and U6 snRNAs and includes a metal bound by U6 snRNA. The precise architecture of the splicesome active site however, including the question of whether it includes protein components, remains unresolved. A wealth of evidence places the protein PRP8 at the heart of the spliceosome through assembly and catalysis. Here we provide evidence that the RNase H domain of PRP8 undergoes a conformational switch between the two steps of splicing rationalizing yeast prp8 alleles promoting either the first or second step. We also show that this switch unmasks a metal-binding site involved in the second step. Together these data establish that PRP8 is a metalloprotein that promotes exon ligation within the spliceosome.",

The structure also brings in a number of signaling molecules, such as kinases and phosphatases, which regulate microtubule dynamics and cell cycle progression. Erroneous microtubule attachment is destabilized by Aurora B-mediated phosphorylation of multiple microtubule-binding protein complexes at the kinetochore, such as the KMN network proteins and the Ska/Dam1 complex, while Plk-dependent phosphorylation of BubR1 stabilizes kinetochore-microtubule attachment by recruiting PP2A-B56. Spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) signaling, which is activated by unattached kinetochores and inhibits the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, depends on kinetochore recruitment of the kinase Bub1 through Mps1-mediated phosphorylation of the kinetochore protein KNL1 (also known as Blinkin in mammals, Spc105 in budding yeast, and Spc7 in fission yeast). Recruitment of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to KNL1 is necessary to silence the SAC upon bioriented microtubule attachment. One of the key unsolved questions in the mitosis field is how a mechanical change at the kinetochore upon microtubule attachment is converted to these and other chemical signals that control microtubule attachment and the SAC. Rapid progress in the field is revealing the existence of an intricate signaling network created right on the kinetochore. Here we review the current understanding of phosphorylation-mediated regulation of kinetochore functions and discuss how this signaling network generates an accurate switch that turns on and off the signaling output in response to kinetochore-microtubule attachment.",mitosis;cell cycle;chromosome segregation;kinetochore;spindle;checkpoint;kinase;phosphatase;feedback

This motivates numerous studies of TRs and their evolution, requiring accurate multiple sequence alignment. TRs may be lost or inserted at any position of a TR region by replication slippage or recombination, but current methods assume fixed unit boundaries, and yet are of high complexity. We present a new global graph-based alignment method that does not restrict TR unit indels by unit boundaries. TR indels are modeled separately and penalized using the phylogeny-aware alignment algorithm. This ensures enhanced accuracy of reconstructed alignments, disentangling TRs and measuring indel events and rates in a biologically meaningful way. Our method detects not only duplication events but also all changes in TR regions owing to recombination, strand slippage and other events inserting or deleting TR units. We evaluate our method by simulation incorporating TR evolution, by either sampling TRs from a profile hidden Markov model or by mimicking strand slippage with duplications. The new method is illustrated on a family of type III effectors, a pathogenicity determinant in agriculturally important bacteria Ralstonia solanacearum.

Much of the sequence diversity in the HIV-1 genome is concentrated within Env, particularly within its gp120 surface subunit. While dramatic functional diversity exists among HIV-1 Env isolates—observable even in the context of monomeric gp120 proteins as differences in antigenicity and immunogenicity—we have little understanding of the structural features that distinguish Env isolates and lead to isolate-specific functional differences, as crystal structures of truncated gp120 “core” proteins from diverse isolates reveal a high level of structural conservation. Because gp120 proteins are used as prospective vaccine immunogens, it is critical to understand the structural factors that influence their reactivity with antibodies. Here, we studied four full-length, glycosylated gp120 monomers from diverse HIV-1 isolates by using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to probe the overall subunit morphology and hydrogen/deuterium-exchange with mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to characterize the local structural order of each gp120. We observed that while the overall subunit architecture was similar among isolates by SAXS, dramatic isolate-specific differences in the conformational stability of gp120 were evident by HDX-MS. These differences persisted even with the CD4 receptor bound. Furthermore, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbance assays (ELISAs) showed that disorder was associated with poorer recognition by antibodies targeting conserved conformational epitopes. These data provide additional insight into the structural determinants of gp120 antigenicity and suggest that conformational dynamics should be considered in the selection and design of optimized Env immunogens.",

The CarD N-terminal domain, which defines the large CarD_CdnL_TRCF protein family, binds to CarG, a zinc-associated protein that does not bind DNA. The CarD C-terminal domain resembles eukaryotic high-mobility-group A (HMGA) proteins, and its DNA binding AT hooks specifically recognize the minor groove of appropriately spaced AT-rich tracts. Here, we investigate the determinants of the only known CarD binding site, the one crucial in CarD-CarG regulation of the promoter of the carQRS operon (PQRS), a light-inducible promoter dependent on the extracytoplasmic function (ECF) σ factor CarQ. In vitro, mutating either of the 3-bp AT tracts of this CarD recognition site (TTTCCAGAGCTTT) impaired DNA binding, shifting the AT tracts relative to PQRS had no effect or marginally lowered DNA binding, and replacing the native site by the HMGA1a binding one at the human beta interferon promoter (with longer AT tracts) markedly enhanced DNA binding. In vivo, however, all of these changes deterred PQRS activation in wild-type M. xanthus, as well as in a strain with the CarD-CarG pair replaced by the Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans CarD-CarG (CarDAd-CarGAd). CarDAd-CarGAd is functionally equivalent to CarD-CarG despite the lower DNA binding affinity in vitro of CarDAd, whose C-terminal domain resembles histone H1 rather than HMGA. We show that CarD physically associates with RNA polymerase (RNAP) specifically via interactions with the RNAP β subunit. Our findings suggest that CarD regulates a light-inducible, ECF σ-dependent promoter by coupling RNAP recruitment and binding to a specific DNA site optimized for affinity and position.",

diversity in genes. However, little is known about the precise functions of individual
isoforms. In fact, proteins (translated from transcript isoforms), not genes, are the
function carriers. By integrating multiple human RNA-seq data sets, we carried out the
first systematic prediction of isoform functions, enabling high-resolution functional
annotation of human transcriptome. Unlike gene function prediction, isoform function
prediction faces a unique challenge: the lack of the training data—all known
functional annotations are at the gene level. To address this challenge, we modelled the
gene–isoform relationships as multiple instance data and developed a novel label
propagation method to predict functions. Our method achieved an average area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.67 and assigned functions to 15 572 isoforms.
Interestingly, we observed that different functions have different sensitivities to
alternative isoform processing, and that the function diversity of isoforms from the same
gene is positively correlated with their tissue expression diversity. Finally, we surveyed
the literature to validate our predictions for a number of apoptotic genes. Strikingly,
for the famous ‘TP53’ gene, we not only accurately identified the apoptosis
regulation function of its five isoforms, but also correctly predicted the precise
direction of the regulation.",

Neurofibrillary tangle formation is preceded by tau oligomerization and accompanied by covalent crosslinking and cytotoxicity, making tangle cytopathogenesis a natural central focus of studies directed at understanding the role of tau in neurodegenerative disease. Recent studies suggest that the formation of tau oligomers may be more closely related to tau neurotoxicity than the presence of the tangles themselves. It has also become increasingly clear that tau pathobiology involves a wide variety of other cellular abnormalities including a disruption of autophagy, vesicle trafficking mechanisms, axoplasmic transport, neuronal polarity, and even the secretion of tau, which is normally a cytosolic protein, to the extracellular space. In this review, we discuss tau misprocessing, toxicity and secretion in the context of normal tau functions in developing and mature neurons. We also compare tau cytopathology to that of other aggregation-prone proteins involved in neurodegeneration (alpha synuclein, prion protein, and APP).

Hsp70 is perhaps the major eukaryotic ribosome-associated chaperone and the first reported to bind cotranslationally to nascent chains. However, little is known about the underlying principles, and function of this interaction. Here, we use a sensitive and global approach to define the cotranslational substrate specificity of the yeast Hsp70 SSB. We find that SSB binds to a subset of nascent polypeptides whose intrinsic properties and slow translation rates hinder efficient cotranslational folding. The SSB-ribosome cycle and substrate recognition is modulated by its ribosome-bound co-chaperone RAC. Deletion of SSB leads to widespread aggregation of newly synthesized polypeptides. Thus, cotranslationally acting Hsp70 meets the challenge of folding the eukaryotic proteome by stabilizing its longer, more slowly translated, and aggregation prone nascent polypeptides.",

Here we use a multifaceted mass spectrometry approach to assess the role of the C-terminal tail in the self-assembly of αB-crystallin. Titration experiments allow us to monitor the binding of peptides representing the C-terminus to the αB-crystallin core domain, and observe individual affinities to both monomeric and dimeric forms. Notably, we find that binding the second peptide equivalent to the core domain dimer is considerably more difficult than the first, suggesting a role of the C-terminus in regulating assembly. This finding motivates us to examine the effect of point mutations in the C-terminus in the full-length protein, by quantifying the changes in oligomeric distribution and corresponding subunit exchange rates. Our results combine to demonstrate that alterations in the C-terminal tail have a significant impact on the thermodynamics and kinetics of αB-crystallin. Remarkably, we find that there is energy compensation between the inter- and intra-dimer interfaces: when one interaction is weakened, the other is strengthened.

We then provide a description of the manner in which phosphorylation at Ser16 modulates the activity of the protein by increasing the populations of its excited states. These results demonstrate that approach that we describe provides a detailed characterisation of the different states of phospholamban that determine the function and regulation of this membrane protein.

Here we utilize a model based on glutamine stretches of 0, 30 or 56 residues in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to understand how such toxic proteins interfere with cellular physiology. A toxicity-mimicking cytostatic effect is evident from compromised colony formation upon expression of polyglutamines. Interestingly, diploid cells are insensitive to polyglutamines and haploid cells can escape cytostasis by hyperploidization. Using a genome-wide screen for genes required to obtain the cytostatic effect, we identify a network related to the budding process and cellular division. We observe a striking mislocalization of the septins Cdc10 and Shs1 in cells arrested by polyglutamines, suggesting that the septin ring may be a pivotal structure connecting polyglutamine toxicity and ploidy.",

Nevertheless, H. pylori-infected subjects can develop chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and gastric cancer. Chronic exposure to the pathogen and its ability to induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the injection of cytotoxin-associated gene A into gastric epithelial cells may be key triggers of carcinogenesis. By deregulating cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions as well as DNA methylation, histone modifications, expression of micro RNAs, and resistance to apoptosis, EMT can actively contribute to early stages of the cancer formation. Host response to the infection significantly contributes to disease development and the concomitance of particular genotypes of both pathogen and host may turn into the most severe outcomes. T regulatory cells (Treg) have been recently demonstrated to play an important role in H. pylori-related disease development and at the same time the Treg-induced tolerance has been proposed as a possible mechanism that leads to less severe disease. Efficacy of antibiotic therapies of H. pylori infection has significantly dropped. Unfortunately, no vaccine against H. pylori is currently licensed, and protective immunity mechanisms against H. pylori are only partially understood. In spite of promising results obtained in animal models of infection with a number of vaccine candidates, few clinical trials have been conducted so far and with no satisfactory outcomes. However, prophylactic vaccination may be the only means to efficiently prevent H. pylori-associated cancers.",Helicobacter pylori;CagA;epithelial to mesenchymal transition;vaccine;junctions;cancer;type IV secretion system

We now present a crystal structure of ZAP-70 in which Tyr 315 and Tyr 319 are not mutated, leading to the recognition of a five-residue sequence register error in the SH2-kinase linker of the original crystallographic model. The revised model identifies distinct roles for these two tyrosines. As seen in a recently reported structure of the related tyrosine kinase Syk, Tyr 315 of ZAP-70 is part of a hydrophobic interface between the regulatory apparatus and the kinase domain, and the integrity of this interface would be lost upon engagement of doubly phosphorylated peptides by the SH2 domains. Tyr 319 is not necessarily dislodged by SH2 engagement, which activates ZAP-70 only ∼5-fold in vitro. In contrast, phosphorylation by Lck activates ZAP-70 ∼100-fold. This difference is due to the ability of Tyr 319 to suppress ZAP-70 activity even when the SH2 domains are dislodged from the kinase domain, providing stringent control of ZAP-70 activity downstream of Lck.",

In this study, site-directed mutagenesis of EspA was performed to elucidate its influence on the ESX-1 system. Replacing Trp55 (W55) or Gly57 (G57) residues in the putative W-X-G motif of EspA with arginines impaired ESAT-6 and CFP-10 secretion in vitro and attenuated M. tuberculosis. Replacing the Phe50 (F50) and Lys62 (K62) residues, which flank the W-X-G motif, with arginine and alanine, respectively, destabilized EspA, abolished ESAT-6 and CFP-10 secretion in vitro, and attenuated M. tuberculosis.

However, these two particular mutations did not attenuate M. tuberculosis in cellular models of infection or during acute infection in mice. We have thus identified amino acid residues in EspA that are important for facilitating ESAT-6 and CFP-10 secretion and virulence. However, our data also indicate for the first time that blockage of M. tuberculosis ESAT-6 and CFP-10 secretion in vitro and attenuation are mutually exclusive.",

Here, we report the first crystal structure of the C-terminal segment of FANCM in complex with FAAP24. The C-terminal segment of FANCM and FAAP24 both consist of a nuclease domain at the N-terminus and a tandem helix-hairpin-helix (HhH)2 domain at the C-terminus. The FANCM-FAAP24 complex exhibits a similar architecture as that of ApXPF. However, the variations of several key residues and the electrostatic property at the active-site region render a catalytically inactive nuclease domain of FANCM, accounting for the lack of nuclease activity. We also show that the first HhH motif of FAAP24 is a potential binding site for DNA, which plays a critical role in targeting FANCM-FAAP24 to chromatin. These results reveal the mechanistic insights into the functions of FANCM-FAAP24 in DNA repair.",

One of the most sensitive membrane curvature sensors, the Amphipathic Lipid Packing Sensor (ALPS) motif, does not seem to recognize the curved surface geometry of membranes per se; rather, it recognizes defects in lipid packing that arise from membrane bending. In a companion paper, we show that these defects can be mimicked by introducing conical lipids in a flat lipid bilayer, in agreement with experimental observations. Here, we use molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations to characterize ALPS binding to such lipid bilayers. The ALPS motif recognizes lipid-packing defects by a conserved mechanism: peptide partitioning is driven by the insertion of hydrophobic residues into large packing defects that are preformed in the bilayer. This insertion induces only minor modifications in the statistical distribution of the free packing defects. ALPS insertion is severely hampered when monounsaturated lipids are replaced by saturated lipids, leading to a decrease in packing defects. We propose that the hypersensitivity of ALPS motifs to lipid packing defects results from the repetitive use of hydrophobic insertions along the monotonous ALPS sequence.",

Mutating the BAK BH1 in the groove prevented activation and MOMP but not the binding of BID. BAK BH3 mutations allowed BID binding and activation but blunted function by blocking BAK oligomerization. BAK activation follows a “hit-and-run” mechanism whereby BID dissociates from the trigger site allowing BAK oligomerization at an overlapping interface.

Crystallography has provided excellent insight into the mechanism by which DC-SIGNR interacts with small glycans, such as (GlcNAc)2Man3; however, direct observation of complexes with larger, physiological oligosaccharides, such as Man9GlcNAc2, remains elusive. We have utilized solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate DC-SIGNR binding and herein report the first backbone assignment of its active, calcium-bound carbohydrate recognition domain. Direct interactions with the small sugar fragments Man3, Man5, and (GlcNAc)2Man3 were investigated alongside Man9GlcNAc derived from recombinant gp120 (present on the HIV viral envelope), providing the first structural data for DC-SIGNR in complex with a virus-associated ligand, and unique binding modes were observed for each glycan. In particular, our data show that DC-SIGNR has a different binding mode for glycans on the HIV viral envelope compared with the smaller glycans previously observed in the crystalline state. This suggests that using the binding mode of Man9GlcNAc, instead of those of small glycans, may provide a platform for the design of DC-SIGNR inhibitors selective for high mannose glycans (like those on HIV). 15N relaxation measurements provided the first information on the dynamics of the carbohydrate recognition domain, demonstrating that it is a highly flexible domain that undergoes ligand-induced conformational and dynamic changes that may explain the ability of DC-SIGNR to accommodate a range of glycans on viral surfaces.",Calcium-binding Proteins;Glycobiology;HIV;Lectin;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance;C-type Lectin;Glycan Binding Affinities;gp120 Man9GlcNAc2;Oligosaccharide Interactions;Solution NMR Dynamics

While MT dynamics are often linked to those of actin filaments, little is known about whether intermediate filaments (IFs) have an influence on MT dynamics. We show here that plectin 1c (P1c), one of the multiple isoforms of the IF-associated cytolinker protein plectin, acts as an MT destabilizer. We found that MTs in P1c-deficient (P1c−/−) keratinocytes are more resistant toward nocodazole-induced disassembly and display increased acetylation. In addition, live imaging of MTs in P1c−/−, as well as in plectin-null, cells revealed decreased MT dynamics. Increased MT stability due to P1c deficiency led to changes in cell shape, increased velocity but loss of directionality of migration, smaller-sized focal adhesions, higher glucose uptake, and mitotic spindle aberrations combined with reduced growth rates of cells. On the basis of ex vivo and in vitro experimental approaches, we suggest a mechanism for MT destabilization in which isoform-specific binding of P1c to MTs antagonizes the MT-stabilizing and assembly-promoting function of MT-associated proteins through an inhibitory function exerted by plectin's SH3 domain. Our results open new perspectives on cytolinker-coordinated IF-MT interaction and its physiological significance.",

Here, we show that conserved arginines on the outer rim of the hexamer that are known to interact with sRNA bodies are required for Hfq’s chaperone activity. Mutations in the arginine patch lower the ability of Hfq to act in sRNA regulation of rpoS translation and eliminate annealing of natural sRNAs or unstructured oligonucleotides, without preventing binding to either the proximal or distal face. Stopped-flow FRET and fluorescence anisotropy show that complementary RNAs transiently form a ternary complex with Hfq, but the RNAs are not released as a double helix in the absence of rim arginines. RNAs bound to either face of Hfq quench the fluorescence of a tryptophan adjacent to the arginine patch, demonstrating that the rim can simultaneously engage two RNA strands.

The NV protease cleaves the polyprotein encoded by open reading frame 1 of the viral genome at five nonhomologous sites, releasing six nonstructural proteins that are essential for viral replication. The structural details of how NV protease recognizes multiple substrates are unclear. In our X-ray structure of an NV protease construct, we observed that the C-terminal tail, representing the native substrate positions P5 to P1, is inserted into the active site cleft of the neighboring protease molecule, providing atomic details of how NV protease recognizes a substrate. The crystallographic structure of NV protease with the C-terminal tail redesigned to mimic P4 to P1 of another substrate site provided further structural details on how the active site accommodates sequence variations in the substrates. Based on these structural analyses, substrate-based aldehyde inhibitors were synthesized and screened for inhibition potency. Crystallographic structures of the protease in complex with each of the three most potent inhibitors were determined. These structures showed concerted conformational changes in the S4 and S2 pockets of the protease to accommodate variations in the P4 and P2 residues of the substrate/inhibitor, which could be a mechanism for how the NV protease recognizes multiple sites in the polyprotein with differential affinities during virus replication. These structures further indicate that the mechanism of inhibition by these inhibitors involves covalent bond formation with the side chain of the conserved cysteine in the active site by nucleophilic addition, and such substrate-based aldehydes could be effective protease inhibitors.",

Post-translation modification of histones dynamically influences gene expression independent of alterations to the DNA sequence. These mechanisms are often mediated by histone linkers or by proteins associated with the recruitment of DNA-binding proteins, HDAC I and II interacting proteins and transcriptional activators, coactivators or corepressors. Early evidence suggested that histones and their modifiers are involved in sophisticated processes that modulate tumor behavior and cellular phenotype. In this review, we discuss how recent discoveries about chromatin modifications, particularly histone acetylation, are shaping our knowledge of cell biology and our understanding of the molecular circuitry governing tumor progression and consider whether recent insights may extend to novel therapeutic approaches.

Many of these diseases are associated with aging, but the mechanism for this connection is unknown. Recent evidence has shown that the formation and accumulation of protein aggregates may be a process frequently occurring during normal aging, but it is unknown whether protein misfolding is a cause or a consequence of aging. To combat the formation of these misfolded aggregates cells have developed complex and complementary pathways aiming to maintain protein homeostasis. These protective pathways include the unfolded protein response, the ubiquitin proteasome system, autophagy, and the encapsulation of damaged proteins in aggresomes. In this paper we review the current knowledge on the role of protein misfolding in disease and aging as well as the implication of deficiencies in the proteostasis cellular pathways in these processes. It is likely that further understanding of the mechanisms involved in protein misfolding and the natural defense pathways may lead to novel strategies for treatment of age-dependent protein misfolding disorders and perhaps aging itself.",

Lysine selection is important for generating diverse substrate-Ub structures and targeting proteins to different fates; however, the mechanisms of lysine selection are not clearly understood. The positioning of lysine(s) toward the E2/E3 active site and residues proximal to lysines are critical in their selection. We investigated determinants of lysine specificity of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34, toward substrate and Ub lysines. Evaluation of the relative importance of different residues positioned −2, −1, +1 and +2 toward ubiquitination of its substrate, Sic1, on lysine 50 showed that charged residues in the −1 and −2 positions negatively impact on ubiquitination. Modeling suggests that charged residues at these positions alter the native salt-bridge interactions in Ub and Cdc34, resulting in misplacement of Sic1 lysine 50 in the Cdc34 catalytic cleft. During polyubiquitination, Cdc34 showed a strong preference for Ub lysine 48 (K48), with lower activity towards lysine 11 (K11) and lysine 63 (K63). Mutating the −2, −1, +1 and +2 sites surrounding K11 and K63 to mimic those surrounding K48 did not improve their ubiquitination, indicating that further determinants are important for Ub K48 specificity. Modeling the ternary structure of acceptor Ub with the Cdc34~Ub complex as well as in vitro ubiquitination assays unveiled the importance of K6 and Q62 of acceptor Ub for Ub K48 polyubiquitination. These findings provide molecular and structural insight into substrate lysine and Ub K48 specificity by Cdc34.",ubiquitin;cell cycle;Cdc34;lysine;Sic1;SCF

Both enzymes cleave Ap3A, but only NPP1 can hydrolyze ATP. Comparative structural analysis reveals a tripartite lysine claw in NPP1 that stabilizes the terminal phosphate of ATP, whereas the corresponding region of NPP4 contains features that hinder this binding orientation, thereby inhibiting ATP hydrolysis. Furthermore, we show that NPP1 is unable to induce platelet aggregation at physiologic concentrations reported in human blood, but it could stimulate platelet aggregation if localized at low nanomolar concentrations on vascular endothelium.

In order to cope with water deprivation, plants have to adapt their development and metabolism to ensure survival. To maximize water use efficiency, plants use a large array of signaling mediators such as hormones, protein kinases, and phosphatases, Ca2+, reactive oxygen species, and low abundant phospholipids that together form complex signaling cascades. Phosphatidic acid (PA) is a signaling lipid that rapidly accumulates in response to a wide array of abiotic stress stimuli. PA formation provides the cell with spatial and transient information about the external environment by acting as a protein-docking site in cellular membranes. PA reportedly binds to a number of proteins that play a role during water limiting conditions, such as drought and salinity and has been shown to play an important role in maintaining root system architecture. Members of two osmotic stress-activated protein kinase families, sucrose non-fermenting 1-related protein kinase 2 and mitogen activated protein kinases were recently shown bind PA and are also involved in the maintenance of root system architecture and salinity stress tolerance. In addition, PA regulates several proteins involved in abscisic acid-signaling. PA-dependent recruitment of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase under water limiting conditions indicates a role in regulating metabolic processes. Finally, a recent study also shows the PA recruits the clathrin heavy chain and a potassium channel subunit, hinting toward additional roles in cellular trafficking and potassium homeostasis. Taken together, the rapidly increasing number of proteins reported to interact with PA implies a broad role for this versatile signaling phospholipid in mediating salt and water stress responses.",phosphatidic acid;Arabidopsis thaliana;roots;salt;drought;protein kinase

Coilin, also known as the marker protein for the CB, is a phosphoprotein widely accepted for its role in maintaining CB integrity. Recent studies have been done to further elucidate functional activities of coilin apart from its structural role in the CB in an attempt to explore the rationale for coilin expression in cells that have few CBs or lack them altogether. Here we show that the RNA association profile of coilin changes in mitosis with respect to that during interphase. We provide evidence of transcriptional and/or processing dysregulation of several CB-related RNA transcripts as a result of ectopic expression of both wild-type and phosphomutant coilin proteins. We also show apparent changes in transcription and/or processing of these transcripts upon coilin knockdown in both transformed and primary cell lines. Additionally, we provide evidence of specific coilin RNase activity regulation, on both U2 and hTR transcripts, by phosphorylation of a single residue, serine 489.

Arrestins specifically bind active phosphorylated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), thereby precluding further G protein activation. Recent discoveries suggest that the formation of the arrestin-receptor complex initiates the second round of signaling with comparable biological importance. Despite having virtually no recognizable sequence motifs known to mediate protein-protein interactions, arrestins bind a surprising variety of signaling proteins with mind-boggling range of functional consequences. High conformational flexibility allows arrestins to show many distinct “faces” to the world, which allows these relatively small ~45 kDa proteins to bind various partners under different physiological conditions, organizing multi-protein signaling complexes and localizing them to distinct sub-cellular compartments.",

Stathmin (STMN), a cytoplasmic microtubule-destabilizing phosphoprotein, regulates interphase microtubules during cell stress, but the signaling mechanisms involved are poorly defined. In this study ectopic expression of single alanine-substituted phospho-resistant mutants demonstrated that STMN Ser-38 and Ser-63 phosphorylation were specifically required to maintain interphase microtubules during hyperosmotic stress. STMN was phosphorylated on Ser-38 and Ser-63 in response to hyperosmolarity, heat shock, and arsenite treatment but rapidly dephosphorylated after oxidative stress treatment. Two-dimensional PAGE and Phos-tag gel analysis of stress-stimulated STMN phospho-isoforms revealed rapid STMN Ser-38 phosphorylation followed by subsequent Ser-25 and Ser-63 phosphorylation. Previously, we delineated stress-stimulated JNK targeting of STMN. Here, we identified cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) signaling as responsible for stress-induced STMN Ser-63 phosphorylation. Increased cAMP levels induced by cholera toxin triggered potent STMN Ser-63 phosphorylation. Osmotic stress stimulated an increase in PKA activity and elevated STMN Ser-63 and CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein) Ser-133 phosphorylation that was substantially attenuated by pretreatment with H-89, a PKA inhibitor. Interestingly, PKA activity and subsequent phosphorylation of STMN were augmented in the absence of JNK activation, indicating JNK and PKA pathway cross-talk during stress regulation of STMN. Taken together our study indicates that JNK- and PKA-mediated STMN Ser-38 and Ser-63 phosphorylation are required to preserve interphase microtubules in response to hyperosmotic stress.",Cytoskeleton;Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK);Protein Kinase A (PKA);Protein Phosphorylation;Signal Transduction;Osmotic Stress;Stathmin

Here, we report a mechanism by which MEF/ELF4 may be activated by a common leukemia-associated mutation in the nucleophosmin gene. By using a tandem affinity purification assay, we found that MEF/ELF4 interacts with multifactorial protein nucleophosmin (NPM1). Coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down experiments demonstrated that MEF/ELF4 directly forms a complex with NPM1 and also identified the region of NPM1 that is responsible for this interaction. Functional analyses showed that wild-type NPM1 inhibited the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of MEF/ELF4 on the HDM2 promoter, whereas NPM1 mutant protein (Mt-NPM1) enhanced these activities of MEF/ELF4. Induction of Mt-NPM1 into MEF/ELF4-overexpressing NIH3T3 cells facilitated malignant transformation. In addition, clinical leukemia samples with NPM1 mutations had higher human MDM2 (HDM2) mRNA expression.

The mechanism of SEPT9 interaction with MTs and the molecular basis of HNA are unknown. Here, we show that the N-terminal domain of SEPT9 contains the novel repeat motifs K/R-x-x-E/D and R/K-R-x-E, which bind and bundle MTs by interacting with the acidic C-terminal tails of β-tubulin. Alanine scanning mutagenesis revealed that the K/R-R/x-x-E/D motifs pair electrostatically with one another and the tails of β-tubulin, enabling septin–septin interactions that link MTs together. SEPT9 isoforms lacking repeat motifs or containing the HNA-linked mutation R88W, which maps to the R/K-R-x-E motif, diminished intracellular MT bundling and impaired asymmetric neurite growth in PC-12 cells. Thus, the SEPT9 repeat motifs bind and bundle MTs, and thereby promote asymmetric neurite growth. These results provide the first insight into the mechanism of septin interaction with MTs and the molecular and cellular basis of HNA.",

Germ-line mutations in SHP2 cause clinically similar LEOPARD and Noonan syndromes, two of several autosomal-dominant conditions characterized by gain-of-function mutations in the Ras pathway. Interestingly, Noonan syndrome SHP2 mutants are constitutively active, whereas LEOPARD syndrome SHP2 mutants exhibit reduced phosphatase activity. How do catalytically impaired LEOPARD syndrome mutants engender gain-of-function phenotypes? Our study reveals that LEOPARD syndrome mutations weaken the intramolecular interaction between the N-SH2 and phosphatase domains, leading to a change in SHP2 molecular switching mechanism. Consequently, LEOPARD syndrome SHP2 mutants bind upstream activators preferentially and are hypersensitive to growth factor stimulation. They also stay longer with scaffolding adapters, thus prolonging substrate turnover, which compensates for the reduced phosphatase activity. The study provides a solid framework for understanding how individual SHP2 mutations cause diseases.",Allosteric Regulation;Enzyme Structure;ERK;Phosphotyrosine Signaling;Tyrosine Protein Phosphatase (Tyrosine Phosphatase);LEOPARD Syndrome

Here we solved a full-length R-dimer structure that reflects the biologically relevant conformation, and this structure agrees well with small angle X-ray scattering. An isoform-specific interface is revealed between the protomers. This interface acts as an intermolecular sensor for cAMP and explains the cooperative character of cAMP binding to the RIα dimer.

While PolC represents an evolutionary compact group, DnaE can be further subdivided into at least three groups (DnaE1-3). We performed an extensive analysis of various sequence, structure and surface properties of all four polymerase groups. Our analysis suggests a specific evolutionary pathway leading to PolC and DnaE from the last common ancestor and reveals important differences between extant polymerase groups. Among them, DnaE1 and PolC show the highest conservation of the analyzed properties. DnaE3 polymerases apparently represent an ‘impaired’ version of DnaE1. Nonessential DnaE2 polymerases, typical for oxygen-using bacteria with large GC-rich genomes, have a number of features in common with DnaE3 polymerases.

Rapid kinetic measurements and electron microscopy demonstrated that fesselin, isolated from turkey gizzard muscle, reduced the rate of dissociation of myosin filaments. Addition of fesselin increased both the length and thickness of myosin filaments. The rate of detachment of myosin, but not HMM, from actin was also greatly reduced by fesselin.

Assembly and mineralization of full-length native (P173) and recombinant (rP172) porcine amelogenins were studied by cryogenic Transmission Electron Microscopy (cryoTEM). The cryoTEM revealed that both native and recombinant porcine amelogenins undergo step-wise self-assembly. Although the overall structural organization of P173 and rP172 oligomers was similar and resembled oligomers of murine recombinant amelogenin rM179, there were subtle differences suggesting that a single phosphorylated serine present in P173 might affect amelogenin self-assembly. Our mineralization studies demonstrated that both P173 and rP172 oligomers stabilize initial mineral clusters. Importantly, however, rP172 regulated the organization of initial mineral clusters into linear chains and guided the formation of parallel arrays of elongated mineral particles, which are the hallmark of enamel structural organization. These results are similar to those obtained previously using full-length recombinant murine amelogenin (Fang et al., 2011a). In contrast to that seen with rP172, phosphorylated P173 strongly inhibits mineralization for extended periods of time. We propose that these differences might be due to the differences in the structural organization and charge distribution between P173 and rP172. Overall our studies indicate that self-assembly of amelogenin and the mechanisms of its control over mineralization might be universal across different mammalian species.

Second, these processes are connected in feedback interactions and over a large range of spatial and temporal scales. Third, many processes are stochastic, which leads to heterogeneous migration behaviors. Early on in the research of cell migration it became evident that this complexity exceeds human intuition. Thus, the cell migration community has led the charge to build mathematical models that could integrate the diverse experimental observations and measurements in consistent frameworks, first in conceptual and more recently in molecularly explicit models.

We report here that membrane association of farnesylated Δ50 lamin A tail domains requires calcium. Experimental evidence and molecular dynamics simulations collectively suggest that the farnesyl group is sequestered within a hydrophobic region in the tail domain in the absence of calcium. Calcium binds to the tail domain with an affinity KD ≈ 250 μM where it alters the structure of the Ig-fold and increases the solvent accessibility of the C-terminus. In 2 mM CaCl2, the affinity of the farnesylated protein to a synthetic membrane is KD ≈ 2 μM, as measured with surface plasmon resonance, but showed a combination of aggregation and binding.

The dynamics of Fe–O2 rotation and tert-butyl motion in three different picket fence porphyrin derivatives has been studied by a combination of multi-temperature X-ray structural studies and Mössbauer spectroscopy. The structural studies show that the motions of the dioxygen ligand also require motions of the protecting pickets of the ligand binding pocket. The two motions appear to be correlated and the temperature-dependent change in the O2 occupancies can not be governed by a simple Boltzmann distribution. The three [Fe(TpivPP)(RIm)(O2)] derivatives studied have RIm = 1-methyl-, 1-ethyl-, or 2-methylimidazole. In all three species there is a preferred orientation of the Fe–O2 moiety with respect to the trans imidazole ligand and the population of this orientation increases with decreasing temperature. In the 1-MeIm and 1-EtIm species, the Fe–O2 unit is approximately perpendicular to the imidazole plane whereas in the 2-MeHIm species the Fe–O2 unit is approximately parallel. This reflects the low energy required for rotation of the Fe–O2 unit and the small energy differences in populating the possible pocket quadrants. All dioxygen complexes have a crystallographically required twofold axis of symmetry that limits the accuracy of the determined Fe–O2 geometry. However, the 80 K structure of the 2-MeHIm derivative allowed for the resolution of the two bonded oxygen atom positions and provided the best geometric description for the Fe–O2 unit. The values determined are: Fe–O = 1.811(5) Å, Fe–O–O = 118.2(9)°, O–O = 1.281(12) Å, and an off-axis tilt of 6.2°. The demonstration of the off-axis tilt is a first. We present detailed temperature-dependent simulations of the Mössbauer spectra that model the changing value of the quadrupole splitting and line widths. Residuals to fits are poorer at higher temperature. We believe that this is consistent with the idea that population of the two conformers are related to the concomitant motions of both Fe–O2 rotations and motions of the protecting tert-butyl pickets.",

Recent single-molecule spectroscopy studies on the trimeric LHCII complex showed that environmental control of the intrinsic protein disorder could in principle explain the switch between their light-harvesting and photoprotective conformations in vivo. However, the validity of this proposal depends strongly on the specificity of the protein dynamics. Here, a similar study has been performed on the minor monomeric antenna complexes of photosystem II (CP29, CP26, and CP24). Despite their high structural homology, similar pigment content and organization compared to LHCII trimers, the environmental response of these proteins was found to be rather distinct. A much larger proportion of the minor antenna complexes were present in permanently weakly fluorescent states under most conditions used; however, unlike LHCII trimers the distribution of the single-molecule population between the strongly and weakly fluorescent states showed no significant sensitivity to low pH, zeaxanthin, or low detergent conditions. The results support a unique role for LHCII trimers in the regulation of light harvesting by controlled fluorescence blinking and suggest that any contribution of the minor antenna complexes to photoprotection would probably involve a distinct mechanism.",

The characterization of such regions, including the description of their structural propensities, number of conformations and relative populations can provide useful insights. Prion diseases result from the conversion of a normal glycoprotein into a misfolded pathogenic isoform. The structures of mammal and chicken prion proteins show a similar fold with a globular domain and a flexible N-terminal portion that contains different repeated regions: octarepeats (PHGGGWGQ) in mammals and hexarepeats (PHNPGY) in chickens. The higher number of prolines in the hexarepeat region suggests that this region may retain a significant amount of residual secondary structure. Here, we report the CD, NMR and MD characterization of a peptide (2-HexaPY) composed of two hexarepeats. We combine experimental NMR data and MD to investigate at atomic level its ensemble-averaged structural properties, demonstrating how each residue of both repeats has a different quantified PPII propensity that shows a periodicity along the sequence. This feature explains the absence of cooperativity to stabilize a PPII conformation. Nonetheless, such residual structure can play a role in nucleating local structural transitions as well as modulating intra-molecular or inter-molecular interactions.",avian prion repeats;NMR;CD;conformational ensemble;polyproline II

In this work, we investigate the role that two of these changing conditions, pH and ionic strength, have in modulating the interaction of the amelogenin, LRAP, with hydroxyapatite (HAP). Using solid state NMR dipolar recoupling and chemical shift data, we investigate the structure, orientation and dynamics of three regions in the N-terminus of the protein, L15 to V19, V19 to L23 and K24 to S28. These regions are also near the only phosphorylated residue in the protein, pS16, therefore, changes in the LRAP-HAP interaction as a function of phosphorylation (LRAP(−P) vs. LRAP(+P)) were also investigated. All of the regions and conditions studied for the surface immobilized proteins showed restricted motion, with indications of slightly more mobility under all conditions for L15(+P) and K24(−P). The structure and orientation of the LRAP-HAP interaction in the N-terminus of the phosphorylated protein is very stable to changing solution conditions. From REDOR dipolar recoupling data, the structure and orientation in the region L15V19(−P) did not change significantly as a function of pH or ionic strength. The structure and orientation of the region V19L23(+P) were also stable to changes in pH, with the only significant change observed at high ionic strength, where the region becomes extended, suggesting this may be an important region in regulating mineral development. Chemical shift studies also suggest minimal changes in all three regions studied for both LRAP(−P) and LRAP(+P) as a function of pH or ionic strength and reveal that K24 has multiple resolvable resonance, suggestive of two coexisting structures. Phosphorylation also alters the LRAP-HAP interface. All of the three residues investigated (L15, V19, and K24) are closer to the surface in LRAP(+P), but K24S28 also changes structure as a result of phosphorylation, from a random coil to a largely helical structure, and V19L23 becomes more extended at high ionic strength when phosphorylated. These observations suggest that ionic strength and dephosphorylation may provide switching mechanisms to trigger a change in the function of the N-terminus.",

These complexes span both the inner and outer membranes of the bacterium via an α-helical, inner membrane transporter; a periplasmic membrane fusion protein; and a β-barrel, outer membrane channel. One such efflux system CusCBA is responsible for extruding biocidal Cu(I) and Ag(I) ions. To remove these toxic ions, the CusC outer membrane channel must form a β-barrel structural domain, which creates a pore and spans the entire outer membrane. We here report the crystal structures of wild-type CusC as well as two CusC mutants, suggesting that the first N-terminal cysteine residue plays an important role in protein-membrane interactions and is critical for the insertion of this channel protein into the outer membrane. These structures provide insight into the mechanisms on CusC folding and transmembrane channel formation. It is also found that the interactions between CusC and membrane may be crucial for controlling the opening and closing of this β-barrel, outer membrane channel.",

Coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy confirmed that HB interacts and colocalizes with the C protein in the cytoplasm. Silencing of HB with small interfering RNAs promoted CSFV growth and replication, whereas overexpression of HB suppressed CSFV replication and growth. Interestingly, HB was found to interact with retinoic acid-inducible gene I and increase its expression, resulting in increased production of type I interferon (IFN). However, HB was unable to suppress CSFV growth when the RIG-I pathway was blocked. Overall, our results suggest that cellular HB antagonizes CSFV growth and replication by triggering IFN signaling, and might represent a novel antiviral restriction factor.

However, understanding of the precise interaction of subunits associating with Tim23 remains largely elusive. Our findings highlight that transmembrane helix 1 (TM1) is required for homodimerization of Tim23, while, together with TM2, it is involved in preprotein binding within the channel. Based on our evidence, we predict that the TM1 and TM2 from each dimer are involved in the formation of the central translocation pore, aided by Tim17. Furthermore, TM2 is also involved in the recruitment of Tim21 and the presequence-associated motor (PAM) subcomplex to the Tim23 channel, while the matrix-exposed loop L1 generates specificity in their association with the core complex. Strikingly, our findings indicate that the C-terminal sequence of Tim23 is dispensable for growth and functions as an inhibitor for binding of Tim21.

We characterize the label’s frequencies and lifetimes using 2D IR spectroscopy in solvents of varying dielectric. The frequency range spans 10 cm−1, and the variation in lifetimes ranges from 6 to 19 ps, indicating that these probes are very sensitive to their environments. Also, we attached probes with -(CH2)-, -(CH2)3-, -(CH2)4- linkers to ubiquitin at positions 6 and 63 and collected spectra in aqueous buffer. The frequencies and lifetimes were correlated for 3C and 4C linkers, as they were in the solvents, but did not correlate for the 1C linker.

","Notch refers to a highly conserved cell-to-cell signaling pathway with essential roles in embryonic development and tissue maintenance. Dysfunctional signaling causes human disease, highlighting the importance of pathway regulation. Notch signaling ultimately results in the activation of target genes, which is regulated by the nuclear effector CSL. CSL dually functions as an activator and repressor of transcription through differential interactions with coactivator or corepressor proteins, respectively. While the structures of CSL-coactivator complexes have been determined, the structures of CSL-corepressor complexes are unknown. Here, using a combination of structural, biophysical, and cellular approaches, we characterize the structure and function of CSL in complex with the corepressor KyoT2. Collectively, our studies provide molecular insights into how KyoT2 binds CSL with high affinity and competes with coactivators, such as Notch, for binding CSL.

The pleiotropic effects of vitamin A are exerted mainly by one active metabolite, all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), which regulates the expression of a battery of target genes through several families of nuclear receptors (RARs, RXRs, and PPARβ/δ), polymorphic retinoic acid (RA) response elements, and multiple coregulators. It also involves extranuclear and nontranscriptional effects, such as the activation of kinase cascades, which are integrated in the nucleus via the phosphorylation of several actors of RA signaling. However, vitamin A itself proved recently to be active and RARs to be present in the cytosol to regulate translation and cell plasticity.

This function has been shown to be important to cellular viability and sHSP function/dysfunction is implicated in many diseases, including Alzheimer’s and Alexander disease. Though their gene products are small, many sHSPs assemble into a distribution of large oligomeric states that undergo dynamic subunit exchange. These inherent properties present significant experimental challenges for characterizing sHSP oligomers. Of the ten mammalian sHSPs, the human sHSP 03B1;B crystallin is a paradigm example of sHSP oligomeric properties. Advances in our understanding of sHSP structure, oligomeric distribution, and dynamics have prompted the proposal of several models for the oligomeric states of B.

The cooperative function of these two proteins controls crystal nucleation and morphology in vitro. We quantitatively analyzed the co-localization between enamelin and amelogenin by confocal microscopy and using two antibodies, one raised against a sequence in the porcine 32 kDa enamelin region and the other raised against full-length recombinant mouse amelogenin. We further investigated the interaction of the porcine 32 kDa enamelin and recombinant amelogenin using immuno-gold labeling. This study reports the quantitative co-localization results for postnatal days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 mandibular mouse molars. We show that amelogenin and enamelin are secreted into the extracellular matrix on the cuspal slopes of the molars at day 1 and that secretion continues to at least day 8. Quantitative co-localization analysis (QCA) was performed in several different configurations using large (45 μm height, 33 μm width) and small (7 μm diameter) regions of interest to elucidate any patterns. Co-localization patterns in day 8 samples revealed that enamelin and amelogenin co-localize near the secretory face of the ameloblasts and appear to be secreted approximately in a 1:1 ratio. The degree of co-localization decreases as the enamel matures, both along the secretory face of ameloblasts and throughout the entire thickness of the enamel. Immuno-reactivity against enamelin is concentrated along the secretory face of ameloblasts, supporting the theory that this protein together with amelogenin is intimately involved in mineral induction at the beginning of enamel formation.",enamelin;amelogenin;protein-protein interaction;confocal microscopy;quantitative co-localization analysis

An exception is a small group of vascular angiosperm plants, termed resurrection plants. They have evolved unique mechanisms of desiccation tolerance and thus can tolerate severe water loss, and mostly adjust their water content with the relative humidity in the environment. Desiccation tolerance is a complex phenomenon and depends on the regulated expression of numerous genes during dehydration and subsequent rehydration. Most of the resurrection plants have a large genome and are difficult to transform which makes them unsuitable for genetic approaches. However, technical advances have made it possible to analyze changes in gene expression on a large-scale. These approaches together with comparative studies with non-desiccation tolerant plants provide novel insights into the molecular processes required for desiccation tolerance and will shed light on identification of orphan genes with unknown functions. Here, we review large-scale recent transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies that have been performed in desiccation tolerant plants and discuss how these studies contribute to understanding the molecular basis of desiccation tolerance.",transcriptomics;proteomics;metabolomics;resurrection plants;desiccation tolerance

Collectively, these effects contribute to enzyme catalysis. Here we describe how crowding may bias the conformational change and dynamics of enzyme populations and in this way affect catalysis. Crowding effects have been studied using artificial crowding agents and in vivo-like environments. These studies revealed a correlation between protein dynamics and function in the crowded environment. We suggest that crowded environments be classified into uniform crowding and structured crowding. Uniform crowding represents random crowding conditions created by synthetic particles with a narrow size distribution. Structured crowding refers to the highly coordinated cellular environment, where proteins and other macromolecules are clustered and organized. In structured crowded environments the perturbation of protein thermal stability may be lower; however, it may still be able to modulate functions effectively and dynamically. Dynamic, allosteric enzymes could be more sensitive to cellular perturbations if their free energy landscape is flatter around the native state; on the other hand, if their free energy landscape is rougher, with high kinetic barriers separating deep minima, they could be more robust. Above all, cells are structured; and this holds both for the cytosol and for the membrane environment. The crowded environment is organized, which limits the search, and the crowders are not necessarily inert. More likely, they too transmit allosteric effects, and as such play important functional roles. Overall, structured cellular crowding may lead to higher enzyme efficiency and specificity.",Allostery;Conformational selection;Energy landscape;Enzymatics;Macromolecular crowding;Protein dynamics

It now appears that similar mechanisms of self-propagation may underlie other proteinopathies such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. This link is of scientific interest and potential therapeutic importance as this route of self-propagation offers conceptual support and guidance for vaccine development efforts.

Genomic rearrangements involving the ETS family of transcription factors are estimated to be present in 50-70% of prostate cancer cases. These rearrangements fuse the ETS factors with promoters of genes that are androgen regulated. Thus, the expression of ETS factors, such as ERG, ETV1, ETV4 and ETV5, is mediated by androgen. In-vitro and in-vivo studies suggest that overexpression of ETS proteins increase cell proliferation and confer an invasive phenotype to prostate cancer cells. Epidemiological studies demonstrate that ETS-fusion positive patients exhibit tumors corresponding to a more advanced disease. The ability of ETS factors to serve as markers for screening and diagnosing prostate cancer patients is being investigated, and the results have been largely positive to date. Additionally, ETS factors present an excellent opportunity as therapeutic targets and several strategies have been devised to directly target ETS proteins or their binding partners and downstream effectors.",Prostate cancer;chromosomal translocation;transcription factor;ETS;TMPRSS2-ERG;ETV1

Mutations in the human ortholog of MeaB result in methylmalonic aciduria, an inborn error of metabolism. G-proteins typically utilize conserved switch I and II motifs for signaling to effector proteins via conformational changes elicited by nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. Our recent discovery that MeaB utilizes an unusual switch III region for bidirectional signaling with MCM raised questions about the roles of the switch I and II motifs in MeaB. In this study, we addressed the functions of conserved switch II residues by performing alanine-scanning mutagenesis. Our results demonstrate that the GTPase activity of MeaB is autoinhibited by switch II and that this loop is important for coupling nucleotide-sensitive conformational changes in switch III to elicit the multiple chaperone functions of MeaB. Furthermore, we report the structure of MeaB·GDP crystallized in the presence of AlFx− to form the putative transition state analog, GDP·AlF4−. The resulting crystal structure and its comparison with related G-proteins support the conclusion that the catalytic site of MeaB is incomplete in the absence of the GTPase-activating protein MCM and therefore unable to stabilize the transition state analog. Favoring an inactive conformation in the absence of the client MCM protein might represent a strategy for suppressing the intrinsic GTPase activity of MeaB in which the switch II loop plays an important role.",Adenosylcobalamin;Crystal Structure;G-proteins;Signaling;Small GTPases

Therefore, they are important targets for novel therapeutics, particularly Bcl-2 homology (BH)3 mimetics. Bcl-B (BCL-2-like protein-10) is a relatively understudied member of the Bcl-2 protein family. Its physiological function is unknown, but it has been proven to have an anti-apoptotic activity and to act as a tumor promoter in mice. In human, high Bcl-B protein expression levels correlate with poor prognosis in various carcinomas and predict treatment resistance in acute myeloid leukemia. We here report that protein expression level and anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-B are dictated by its ubiquitination. We demonstrate that Bcl-B is polyubiquitinated at steady state, in a unique loop between the BH1 and BH2 domains. Mutagenesis identified lysine (K)128 as an acceptor site for polyubiquitin chains, and K119 and K120, but not K181, as potential ubiquitination sites. Mass spectrometry confirmed K128 as a ubiquitination site and defined the polyubiquitin chains as K48-linked, which was confirmed by linkage-specific antibodies. Accordingly, Bcl-B proved to be an instable protein that is subject to ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation at steady state. At equal mRNA expression, protein expression of a lysineless, nonubiquitinated Bcl-B mutant was fivefold higher than that of wild-type Bcl-B, demonstrating that ubiquitination is a key determinant for Bcl-B protein expression levels. Ubiquitination controlled the anti-apoptotic capacity of Bcl-B, in response to a variety of conventional and novel anti-cancer drugs. Certain anti-cancer drugs, known to reduce Mcl-1 protein levels, likewise downregulated Bcl-B. Together, these data demonstrate that polyubiquitination and proteasomal turnover dictate the expression level and anti-apoptotic capacity of Bcl-B.",apoptosis;Bcl-2 family;Bcl-B;ubiquitination

Processes ranging from cell cycle control, pathogen resistance, and protein quality control rely on selective protein degradation at the proteasome for homeostatic function. Perhaps as a consequence of the importance of this pathway, and the genesis of severe diseases upon its dysregulation, protein degradation by the UPS is highly controlled from the level of substrate recognition to proteolysis. Technological advances over the last decade have created an explosion of structural and mechanistic information that has underscored the complexity of the proteasome and its upstream regulatory factors. Significant insights have come from study of the 19S proteasome regulatory particle (RP) responsible for recognition and processing of ubiquitinated substrates destined for proteolysis. Established as a highly dynamic proteasome activator, a large number of both permanent and transient RP components with specialized functional roles are critical for proteasome function. In this review, we highlight recent mechanistic developments in the study of proteasome activation by the RP and how they provide context to our current understanding of the UPS.",

There is proof-of-principle evidence that a prion vaccine is possible but this is tempered with concerns of the potential dangers associated with induction of immune responses to a widely-expressed self-protein. By targeting epitopes that are specifically exposed upon protein misfolding, our group developed a vaccine that induces PrPSc-specific antibody responses. Here we consider the ability of this polyclonal antibody (SN6b) to bind to a mutant of PrPC associated with spontaneous prion disease. Polyclonal antibodies were selected to mimic the vaccination outcome and also explore all possible protein conformations of the recombinant bovine prion protein with mutation T194A [bPrP(T194A)]. This mutant is a homolog of the human T183A mutation of PrPC that is associated with early onset of familial dementia. With nanopore analysis, under non-denaturing conditions, we observed binding of the SN6b antibody to bPrP(T194A). This interaction was confirmed through ELISAs as well as immunoprecipitation of the recombinant and cellularly expressed forms of bPrP(T194A). This interaction did not promote formation of a protease resistant conformation of PrP in vitro. Collectively, these findings support the disease-specific approach for immunotherapy of prion diseases but also suggest that the concept of conformation-specific immunotherapy may be complicated in individuals who are genetically predisposed to PrPC misfolding.",nanopore;prion diseases;conformation-specific immunotherapy;antibodies;protein conformation;protein misfolding;protein denaturation;neurodegenerative diseases

The protein contains a well-structured N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain with molten globule characteristics that also contains a thioredoxin-like pair of redox active Cys that promote persulfide reductase activity. Recent reports have highlighted the existence of structural flexibility in the ISU/IscU-type scaffold proteins that mediate Fe-S cluster assembly, which is also likely to serve an important role in the pathway to iron-sulfur cluster maturation. We have previously reported similar structural mobility for the C-terminal domain of human NFU, a protein that has been implicated in the production of sulfide for cluster synthesis, while homologous proteins have also been suggested to serve as Fe-S cluster carriers. Herein we quantitatively characterize the structural stability of the two domains of human NFU, and in particular the functional C-terminal domain. The results of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and variable temperature circular dichroism (VTCD) studies that have been used to analyze the temperature-dependent structural melting profiles of the N- and C-terminal domains, relative to both full-length NFU and an equimolar ratio of the N- and C-terminal domains, and correlated with structural information derived from NMR. Calorimetry results indicate that the C-terminal NFU domain undergoes a significant structural stabilization following interaction with the N-terminal domain, which resulted in a novel and distinctive transition melting profile (Tmsec = 58.1 ± 0.4 °C, ΔHvsec = 60.4 ± 5.3 kcal/mol, Tmter = 49.3 ± 0.3 °C, ΔHvter = 71.8 ± 5.8 kcal/mol). VTCD experiments also revealed a secondary structure transition at 59.2 °C in agreement with calorimetry results. The degree of stabilization was found to be more significant in the full-length NFU, as the C-terminal domain transitions were recorded at higher temperatures (Tmsec = 63.3 ± 3.4 °C, ΔHvsec = 41.8 ± 8.2 kcal/mol). The interactions between the two domains demonstrated the hallmarks of hydrophobic character, as increased ionic strength decreased the degree of stabilization of the C-terminal domain. An increase of 2% in α -helix content further supports interaction between the two domains leading to greater secondary structure stabilization. Heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) experiments indicate the C-terminal domain to adopt an alternate tertiary conformation following binding to the N-terminal domain. The structural rigidity of the N-terminal domain leads to an alternative conformation for the C-terminal domain, suggesting that such an interaction, although weaker compared to the covalently-attached native NFU, is important for the structural chemistry of the native full-length protein. The results also emphasize the likely general importance of such structural flexibility in select proteins mediating metal cofactor biosynthesis.",NFU;VTCD;DSC;NMR;molten globule

Towards this goal, it is important to have access to technologies that are able to measure binding affinities for a large number of potential ligands in a fast and accurate way. Since ligand binding stabilizes the protein structure in a manner dependent on concentration and binding affinity, the magnitude of the protein stabilization effect elicited by binding can be used to identify and characterize ligands. For example, the shift in protein denaturation temperature (Tm shift) has become a popular approach to identify potential ligands. However, Tm shifts cannot be readily transformed into binding affinities and the ligand rank order obtained at denaturation temperatures (60°C or higher) does not necessarily coincide with the rank order at physiological temperature. An alternative approach is the use of chemical denaturation, which can be implemented at any temperature. Chemical denaturation shifts allow accurate determination of binding affinities with a surprisingly wide dynamic range (high micromolar to sub nanomolar) and in situations in which binding changes the cooperativity of the unfolding transition. In this paper we develop the basic analytical equations and provide several experimental examples.",

Here, we use intrinsic fluorescence of a tryptophan located at the dimer interface to show that dimer dissociation occurs slowly, over several hours. We then use hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry experiments, performed by taking time points over the cold denaturation process, to measure amide exchange throughout the protein during approach to the cold denatured state. As expected, a peptide corresponding to the dimer interface became more solvent exposed over time at 3°C; unexpectedly, amide exchange increased throughout the protein over time at 3°C. The rate of increase in amide exchange over time at 3°C was the same for each region and equaled the rate of dimer dissociation measured by tryptophan fluorescence, suggesting that dimer dissociation and formation of the cold denatured intermediate occur without appreciable buildup of folded monomer. The observation that throughout the protein amide exchange increases as phosphofructokinase-2 cold denatures provides experimental evidence for theoretical predictions that cold denaturation primarily occurs by solvent penetration into the hydrophobic core of proteins in a sequence-independent manner.",

was carried out to identify the Toxin–Antitoxin (TA) operons of MazF family followed
by sequence analysis and phylogenetic studies. The genomic DNA upstream of the TA operons
was searched for the presence of regulatory motifs. The MazF family toxins showed a
conserved hydrophobic pocket in a multibinding site and are present in pathogenic
bacteria. The toxins of the MazF family are associated with four main types of cognate
antitoxin partners and cluster as a subfamily on the branches of the phylogenetic tree.
This indicates that transmission of the entire operon is the dominant mode of inheritance.
The plasmid borne TA modules were interspersed between the chromosomal TA modules of the
same subfamily, compatible with a frequent interchange of TA genes between the chromosome
and the plasmid akin to that observed for antibiotic resistance gens. The split network of
the MazF family toxins showed the AbrB-linked toxins as a hub of horizontal gene transfer.
Distinct motifs are present in the upstream region of each subfamily. The presence of MazF
family TA modules in pathogenic bacteria and identification of a conserved binding pocket
are significant for the development of novel antibacterials to disrupt the TA interaction.
However, the role of TAs in stress resistance needs to be established. Phylogenetic

Here we review structural and biophysical studies of CD4 and CD8 interactions with MHC molecules and TCR–pMHC complexes. Crystal structures have been determined of CD8αα and CD8αβ in complex with MHC class I, of CD4 bound to MHC class II, and of a complete TCR–pMHC–CD4 ternary complex. Additionally, the binding of these co-receptors to pMHC and TCR–pMHC ligands has been investigated both in solution and in situ at the T cell–APC interface.

It recognizes, unfolds, and cleaves proteins that are destined for removal, usually by prior attachment to polymers of ubiquitin. This macromolecular machine is composed of two subcomplexes, the 19S regulatory particle (RP) and the 20S core particle (CP), which together contain at least 33 different and precisely positioned subunits. How these subunits assemble into functional complexes is an area of active exploration. Here we describe the current status of studies on the assembly of the 20S proteasome (CP). The 28-subunit CP is found in all three domains of life and its cylindrical stack of four heptameric rings is well conserved. Though several CP subunits possess self-assembly properties, a consistent theme in recent years has been the need for dedicated assembly chaperones that promote on-pathway assembly. To date, a minimum of three accessory factors have been implicated in aiding the construction of the 20S proteasome. These chaperones interact with different assembling proteasomal precursors and usher subunits into specific slots in the growing structure. This review will focus largely on chaperone-dependent CP assembly and its regulation.",

Fesselin promotes G-actin polymerization and the formation of large actin complexes that can be collected by centrifugation at low speed. Because of the potential role of fesselin in some cancers and its effects on actin we further investigated the effect of fesselin on actin. Fesselin initiated actin polymerization at a variety of conditions including the virtual absence of salt. Actin filaments formed at low salt in the presence of fesselin were similar to filaments polymerized in the presence of 100 mM KCl. In both cases the filaments were long and straight with a common orientation. Highly ordered actin bundles formed with increasing times of incubation. Blockers of actin growth at the barbed end (cytochalasin D and CapZ) did not prevent fesselin from polymerizing actin. Low concentrations of fesselin increased the critical concentration of actin. Both observations are consistent with preferential growth at the pointed end of actin filaments. These results indicate a role of fesselin in organizing cellular actin. These and other results indicate that fesselin is part of a cellular actin organizing center.,

Ca-bound CaM interacts with α-syn most strongly at its N-terminus. The N-terminal region of α-syn is important for membrane binding, thus CaM could modulate membrane association of α-syn in a Ca-dependent manner. In contrast, Ca-free CaM has negligible interaction. The interaction with CaM leads to significant signal broadening in both CaM and α-syn NMR spectra, most likely due to conformational exchange. The broadening is much reduced when binding a peptide consisting of the first 19 residues of α-syn. In neurons, most α-syn is acetylated at the N-terminus, and acetylation leads to a ten-fold increase in binding strength for the α-syn peptide (KD = 35 ± 10 μM). The N-terminally acetylated peptide adopts a helical structure at the N-terminus with the acetyl group contacting the N-terminal domain of CaM, and with less ordered helical structure towards the C-terminus of the peptide contacting the CaM C-terminal domain. Comparison with known structures shows the CaM/α-syn complex most closely resembles Ca-bound CaM in a complex with an IQ motif peptide. However, a search comparing the α-syn peptide sequence with known CaM targets, including IQ motifs, found no homologies, thus the N-terminal α-syn CaM binding site appears to be a novel CaM target sequence.",

It is composed from three similar and two identical polypeptide chains, arranged in a ring around a narrow membrane pore. Central to the design of this assembly is a hydrophobic gate in the pore, more than 50 Å away from sites in the extracellular domain where ACh binds. Although the molecular properties of the receptor have been explored intensively over the last few decades, only recently have structures emerged revealing its complex architecture and illuminating how ACh entering the binding sites opens the distant gate. Postsynaptic membranes isolated from the (muscle-derived) electric organ of the Torpedo ray have underpinned most of the structural studies: the membranes form tubular vesicles having receptors arranged on a regular surface lattice, which can be imaged directly in frozen physiological solutions. Advances in electron crystallographic techniques have also been important, enabling analysis of the closed- and open-channel forms of the receptor in unreacted tubes or tubes reacted briefly with ACh. The structural differences between these two forms show that all five subunits participate in a concerted conformational change communicating the effect of ACh binding to the gate, but that three of them (αγ, β and δ) play a dominant role. Flexing of oppositely facing pore-lining α-helices is the principal motion determining the closed/open state of the gate. These results together with the findings of biochemical, biophysical and other structural studies allow an integrated description of the receptor and of its mode of action at the synapse.",

In particular, the accumulation of proteins into neurotoxic aggregates is a common thread for a host of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent work demonstrates that age-related changes to the cellular chaperone repertoire contributes to abnormal buildup of the microtubule-associated protein tau that accumulates in a group of diseases termed tauopathies, the most common being Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The Hsp90 co-chaperone repertoire has diverse effects on tau stability; some co-chaperones stabilize tau while others facilitate its clearance. We propose that each of these proteins may be novel therapeutic targets. While targeting Hsp90 directly may be deleterious at the organismal level, perhaps targeting individual co-chaperone activities will be more tolerable.",

The challenge of accurately measuring raft size is evidenced by the disparate reports of domain sizes, which range from nanometers to microns for the ternary model membrane system sphingomyelin (SM)/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC)/cholesterol (Chol). Using Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), we established phase diagrams for porcine brain SM (bSM)/dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC)/Chol and bSM/POPC/Chol at 15 and 25°C. By combining two techniques with different spatial sensitivities, namely FRET and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), we have significantly narrowed the uncertainty in domain size estimates for bSM/POPC/Chol mixtures. Compositional trends in FRET data revealed coexisting domains at 15 and 25°C for both mixtures, while SANS measurements detected no domain formation for bSM/POPC/Chol. Together these results indicate that liquid domains in bSM/POPC/Chol are between 2 and 7 nm in radius at 25°C: that is, domains must be on the order of the 2–6 nm Förster distance of the FRET probes, but smaller than the ~7 nm minimum cluster size detectable with SANS. However, for palmitoyl SM (PSM)/POPC/Chol at a similar composition, SANS detected coexisting liquid domains. This increase in domain size upon replacing the natural SM component (which consists of a mixture of chain lengths) with synthetic PSM, suggests a role for SM chain length in modulating raft size in vivo.",sphingomyelin;lipid bilayer;coexisting liquid phases;raft;small-angle neutron scattering;nanodomain

To minimize its genotoxic effects, it is tightly regulated either by intrinsic mechanisms (linked to the element itself) or by host-mediated mechanisms. Using mass spectrometry, we show here for the first time that MOS1, the transposase driving the mobility of the mariner Mos1 element, is phosphorylated. We also show that the transposition activity of MOS1 is downregulated by protein kinase AMP cyclic-dependent phosphorylation at S170, which renders the transposase unable to promote Mos1 transposition. One step in the transposition cycle, the assembly of the paired-end complex, is specifically inhibited. At the cellular level, we provide evidence that phosphorylation at S170 prevents the active transport of the transposase into the nucleus. Our data suggest that protein kinase AMP cyclic-dependent phosphorylation may play a double role in the early stages of genome invasion by mariner elements.",

The final step of this process involves severing the SP1 peptide from the CA-SP1 maturation intermediate, which triggers the condensation of the CA protein into the capsid shell. The details of the overall mechanism, including the conformation of the SP1 peptide in CA-SP1, are still under intense debate. In this report, we examine tubular assemblies of CA and the CA-SP1 maturation intermediates using Magic Angle Spinning NMR spectroscopy. At magnetic fields of 19.9 T and above, outstanding-quality 2D and 3D MAS NMR spectra were obtained for tubular CA and CA-SP1 assemblies yield, permitting resonance assignments for subsequent detailed structural characterization. Dipolar- and scalar-based correlation experiments unequivocally indicate that SP1 peptide is in a random coil conformation and mobile in the assembled CA-SP1. Analysis of two CA protein sequence variants reveals that, unexpectedly, the conformations of the SP1 tail, the functionally important CypA loop, and the loop preceding helix 8 are modulated by residue variations at distal sites. These findings provide support for the role of SP1 as a trigger of the disassembly of the immature CA capsid for its subsequent de novo reassembly into mature cores, and establish the importance of sequence-dependent conformational plasticity in CA assembly.",

Conformational selection involves binding of ligand to a pre-existing sparsely-populated conformation of the free protein that is the same as that in the final protein-ligand complex. In the case of induced fit, the ligand binds to the major conformation of the free protein and only subsequent to binding undergoes a conformational change to the final protein-ligand complex. While these two mechanisms can be dissected and distinguished by transient kinetic measurements, direct direction, characterization and visualization of transient, sparsely-populated states of proteins is experimentally challenging. Unless trapped, sparsely-populated states are generally invisible to conventional structural and biophysical techniques, including crystallography and most NMR measurements. In this review we summarize some recent developments in the use of paramagnetic relaxation enhancement to directly study sparsely-populated states proteins and illustrate the application of this approach to two proteins, maltose binding protein and calmodulin, both of which undergo large rigid body conformational rearrangements upon ligand binding from an open apo state to a closed ligand-bound holo state. We show that the apo state ensemble comprises a small population of partially-closed configurations that are similar but not identical to that of the holo state. These results highlight the complementarity and interplay of induced fit and conformational selection and suggest that the existence of partially-closed states in the absence of ligand facilitates the transition to the closed ligand-bound state.",NMR;paramagnetic relaxation enhancement;sparsely-populated transient states;ligand binding;conformational selection;induced fit;maltose binding protein;calmodulin

Perturbation of these processes by mutation typically gives rise to severe pathological conditions. In our efforts to obtain atomic information on MAP/MT interactions with the goal to understand mechanisms that might potentially assist in the development of treatments for these diseases, we have determined the 3D structure of CAP-Gly domain of mammalian dynactin by MAS NMR spectroscopy. We observe two conformations in the β2 strand encompassing residues T43-V44-A45, residues that are adjacent to the disease associated mutation, G59S. Upon binding of CAP-Gly to microtubule plus-end tracking protein EB1, the CAP-Gly shifts to a single conformer. We find extensive chemical shift perturbations in several stretches of residues of CAP-Gly upon binding to EB1, from which we define accurately the CAP-Gly/EB1 binding interface.

The first AMPylator to be discovered, VopS from Vibrio parahaemolyticus, catalyzes the transfer of AMP on to the host GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1. Modification of these proteins disrupts downstream signaling events, contributing to cell rounding and apoptosis, and recent studies have suggested that blocking AMPylation may be an effective route to stop infection. To date, however, no small molecule inhibitors have been discovered for any of the AMPylators. Therefore, we developed a fluorescence-polarization based high-throughput-screening assay and used it to discover the first inhibitors of protein AMPylation. Herein we report the discovery of the first small molecule VopS inhibitors (e.g. calmidazolium, GW7647 and MK886) with Kis ranging from 6–50 µM and upwards of 30-fold selectivity versus HYPE, the only known human AMPylator.",

Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we show that 1-M TMAO and 7-M urea solutions act dramatically differently on these model polymer chains. Their behaviors are sensitive to the strength of the attractive dispersion interactions of the chain with its environment: when these dispersion interactions are high enough, TMAO suppresses the formation of extended conformations of the hydrophobic polymer as compared to water, while urea promotes formation of extended conformations. Similar trends are observed experimentally on real protein systems. Quite surprisingly, we find that both protecting and denaturing osmolytes strongly interact with the polymer, seemingly in contrast with existing explanations of the osmolyte effect on proteins. We show that what really matters for a protective osmolyte is its effective depletion as the polymer conformation changes, which leads to a negative change in the preferential binding coefficient. For TMAO, there is a much more favorable free energy of insertion of a single osmolyte near collapsed conformations of the polymer than near extended conformations. By contrast, urea is preferentially stabilized next to the extended conformation and thus has a denaturing effect.",Protective Osmolyte;Denaturant;Preferential Binding;Polymer Conformations;FEP;PMF

These pumps typically assemble as tripartite complexes, spanning the inner and outer membranes of the cell envelope. In Escherichia coli, the CusC(F)BA complex, which exports copper(I) and silver(I) and mediates resistance to these two metal ions, is the only known RND transporter with a specificity for heavy metals. We have determined the crystal structures of both the inner membrane pump CusA and membrane fusion protein CusB, as well as the adaptor-transporter CusBA complex formed by these two efflux proteins. In addition, the crystal structures of the outer membrane channel CusC and the periplasmic metallochaperone CusF have been resolved. Based on these structures, the entire assembled model of the tripartite efflux system has been developed, and this efflux complex should be in the form of CusC3-CusB6-CusA3. It has been shown that CusA utilizes methionine clusters to bind and export Cu(I) and Ag(I). This pump is likely to undergo a conformational change, and utilize a relay network of methionine clusters as well as conserved charged residues to extrude the metal ions from the bacterial cell.",

SHRs and their coregulators are phosphorylated on multiple sites by a wide variety of kinases. Each site may contribute to multiple functions and the net effect of an individual phosphorylation depends on the activating kinase.

In spite of the importance of RNA, our knowledge about RNA helicases is limited. In this study, we investigated the role of the four DEAD-box RNA helicases in the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis. A strain deleted of all RNA helicases is able to grow at 37°C but not at lower temperatures. The deletion of cshA, cshB, or yfmL in particular leads to cold-sensitive phenotypes. Moreover, these mutant strains exhibit unique defects in ribosome biogenesis, suggesting distinct functions for the individual enzymes in this process. Based on protein accumulation, severity of the cold-sensitive phenotype, and the interaction with components of the RNA degradosome, CshA is the major RNA helicase of B. subtilis. To unravel the functions of CshA in addition to ribosome biogenesis, we conducted microarray analysis and identified the ysbAB and frlBONMD mRNAs as targets that are strongly affected by the deletion of the cshA gene. Our findings suggest that the different helicases make distinct contributions to the physiology of B. subtilis. Ribosome biogenesis and RNA degradation are two of their major tasks in B. subtilis.",

The putative transcriptional regulator WhiB7 is crucial for the activation of systems that provide resistance to diverse antibiotic classes. Here, we used in vitro run-off, two-hybrid assays, as well as mutagenic, complementation and protein pull-down experiments, to characterize WhiB7 as an auto-regulatory, redox-sensitive transcriptional activator in Mycobacterium smegmatis. We provide the first direct biochemical proof that a WhiB protein promotes transcription and also demonstrate that this activity is sensitive to oxidation (diamide). Its partner protein for transcriptional activation was identified as SigA, the primary sigma factor subunit of RNA polymerase. Residues required for the interaction mapped to region 4 of SigA (including R515H) or adjacent domains of WhiB7 (including E63D). WhiB7’s ability to provide a specific spectrum of antibiotic-resistance was dependent on these residues as well as its C-terminal AT-hook module that binds to an AT-rich motif immediately upstream of the −35 hexamer recognized by SigA. These experimentally established constrains, combined with protein structure predictions, were used to generate a working model of the WhiB7–SigA-promoter complex.

E-mail: ude.elay@reknarim.werdna","Three families of membrane-active peptides are commonly found in nature and are classified according to their initial apparent activity. Antimicrobial peptides are ancient components of the innate immune system and typically act by disruption of microbial membranes leading to cell death. Amyloid peptides contribute to the pathology of diverse diseases from Alzheimer's to type II diabetes. Preamyloid states of these peptides can act as toxins by binding to and permeabilizing cellular membranes. Cell-penetrating peptides are natural or engineered short sequences that can spontaneously translocate across a membrane. Despite these differences in classification, many similarities in sequence, structure, and activity suggest that peptides from all three classes act through a small, common set of physical principles. Namely, these peptides alter the Brownian properties of phospholipid bilayers, enhancing the sampling of intrinsic fluctuations that include membrane defects.

Mutations of its pathway components including Suppressor of Fused (Sufu) and Gli/Ci predispose to cancers and congenital anomalies. The Sufu-Gli protein complex occupies a central position in the vertebrate Hh signaling pathway, especially in mammals. Here, structures of full-length human and Drosophila Sufu, the human Sufu-Gli1 complex, along with normal mode analysis and FRET measurement results, reveal that Sufu alternates between “open” and “closed” conformations. The “closed” form of Sufu is stabilized by Gli-binding and inhibited by Hh treatment, whereas the “open” state of Sufu is promoted by Gli-dissociation and Hh signaling. Mutations of critical interface residues disrupt the Sufu-Gli complex, and prevent Sufu from repressing Gli-mediated transcription, tethering Gli in the cytoplasm, and protecting Gli from the 26S proteasome-mediated degradation. Our study thus provides mechanistic insight into the mutual recognition and regulation between Sufu and Gli/Ci.",

A single polar-to-hydrophobic substitution (N11L) at a solvent-exposed position leads to population of an alternate dimeric fold in which 310 helices replace a β-sheet. Here we find that the variant Q9V/N11L/R13V (S-VLV), with two additional polar-to-hydrophobic surface mutations in the same β-sheet, forms a highly stable, reversibly folded octamer with approximately half the✠α-helical content of wild-type Arc. At low protein concentration and low ionic strength, S-VLV also populates both dimeric topologies previously observed for N11L, as judged by NMR chemical shift comparisons. Thus, accumulation of simple hydrophobic mutations in Arc progressively reduces fold specificity, leading first to a sequence with two folds and then to a manifold bridge sequence with at least three different topologies. Residues 9–14 of S-VLV form a highly hydrophobic stretch that is predicted to be amyloidogenic, but we do not observe aggregates of higher order than octamer. Increases in sequence hydrophobicity can promote amyloid aggregation but also exert broader and more complex effects on fold specificity. Altered native folds, changes in fold coupled to oligomerization, toxic pre-amyloid oligomers, and amyloid fibrils may represent a near continuum of accessible alternatives in protein structure space.",sequence-structure relationship;structural degeneracy;polar-to-hydrophobic substitution;structural evolution;fold switching

At least in the case of neomorphic p53 mutations, which acquire oncogenic activity, stabilization is a driving force for tumor progression. It is well documented that p53 mutants are resistant to proteasome-dependent degradation compared with wild-type p53, but the exact identity of the pathways that affect mutant p53 stability is still debated. We have recently shown that macroautophagy (autophagy) provides a route for p53 mutant degradation during restriction of glucose. Here we further show that in basal conditions of growth, inhibition of autophagy with chemical inhibitors or by downregulation of the essential autophagic genes ATG1/Ulk1, Beclin-1 or ATG5, results in p53 mutant stabilization. Conversely, overexpression of Beclin-1 or ATG1/Ulk1 leads to p53 mutant depletion. Furthermore, we found that in many cell lines, prolonged inhibition of the proteasome does not stabilize mutant p53 but leads to its autophagic-mediated degradation. Therefore, we conclude that autophagy is a key mechanism for regulating the stability of several p53 mutants. We discuss plausible mechanisms involved in this newly identified degradation pathway as well as the possible role played by autophagy during tumor evolution driven by mutant p53.",p53;mutant;mutations;autophagy;proteasome;ubiquitin tumor;cancer

A complex tissue-specific network of mechanisms regulates this enzyme, and a major unanswered question in glucokinase biology is how post-translational modifications control the function of the enzyme. Here, we show that the pancreatic isoform of human glucokinase is SUMOylated in vitro, using recombinant enzymes, and in insulin-secreting model cells. Three N-terminal lysines unique for the pancreatic isoform (Lys-12/Lys-13 and/or Lys-15) may represent one SUMOylation site, with an additional site (Lys-346) common for the pancreatic and the liver isoform. SUMO-1 and E2 overexpression stabilized preferentially the wild-type human pancreatic enzyme in MIN6 β-cells, and SUMOylation increased the catalytic activity of recombinant human glucokinase in vitro and also of glucokinase in target cells.

Instead, pre-U5 snRNP includes the Aar2 protein not found in mature U5 snRNP or spliceosomes. Aar2p and Brr2p bind competitively to a C-terminal region of Prp8p that comprises consecutive RNase H-like and Jab1/MPN-like domains. To elucidate the molecular basis for this competition, we determined the crystal structure of Aar2p in complex with the Prp8p RNase H and Jab1/MPN domains. Aar2p binds on one side of the RNase H domain and extends its C terminus to the other side, where the Jab1/MPN domain is docked onto a composite Aar2p–RNase H platform. Known Brr2p interaction sites of the Jab1/MPN domain remain available, suggesting that Aar2p-mediated compaction of the Prp8p domains sterically interferes with Brr2p binding. Moreover, Aar2p occupies known RNA-binding sites of the RNase H domain, and Aar2p interferes with binding of U4/U6 di-snRNA to the Prp8p C-terminal region. Structural and functional analyses of phospho-mimetic mutations reveal how phosphorylation reduces affinity of Aar2p for Prp8p and allows Brr2p and U4/U6 binding.

Biochemical and structural characterization of NEMO has been challenging, however, leading to conflicting data on basic biochemical properties such as the oligomeric state of active NEMO and its binding affinity for IKKβ. We show that up to seven of NEMO’s 11 cysteine residues can be mutated to generate recombinant full-length NEMO that is highly soluble and active. Using a fluorescence anisotropy binding assay we show that full-length NEMO binds a 44-mer peptide encompassing residues 701-745 of IKKβ with KD = 2.2 ± 0.8 nM. The IKKβ binding affinities of mutants with five and seven Cys-to-Ala substitutions are indistinguishable from that of wild-type NEMO. Moreover, when expressed in NEMO −/− fibroblasts, the 5xAla and 7xAla NEMO mutants can interact with cellular IKKβ and restore NF-κB signaling to provide protection against TNFα-induced cell death. Treatment of the NEMO-reconstituted cells with H2O2 led to formation of covalent dimers for wild-type NEMO and the 5xAla mutant, but not for the 7xAla mutant, confirming that Cys54 and/or Cys347 can mediate inter-chain disulfide bonding. However, the IKKβ binding affinity of NEMO is unaffected by the presence or absence of inter-chain disulfide bonding at Cys54 – which lies within the IKKβ binding domain of NEMO – or at Cys347, indicating that NEMO exists as a noncovalent dimer independent of the redox state of its cysteines. This conclusion was corroborated by the observation that the secondary structure content of NEMO and its thermal stability were independent of the presence or absence of inter-chain disulfide bonds.",IKKγ;IKK;bacterial expression;cysteine mutations

Due to a lack of effective treatment, it is imperative to understand the underlying mechanisms and processes involved in disease progression. Regulations in cellular reduction/oxidation (redox) processes are being increasingly implicated in disease. Here we discuss the possible involvement of redox dysregulation in the pathophysiology of ALS, either as a cause of cellular abnormalities or a consequence. We focus on its possible role in oxidative stress, protein misfolding, glutamate excitotoxicity, lipid peroxidation and cholesterol esterification, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired axonal transport and neurofilament aggregation, autophagic stress, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We also speculate that an ER chaperone protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) could play a key role in this dysregulation. PDI is essential for normal protein folding by oxidation and reduction of disulphide bonds, and hence any disruption to this process may have consequences for motor neurons. Addressing the mechanism underlying redox regulation and dysregulation may therefore help to unravel the molecular mechanism involved in ALS.",

While most PD is sporadic in nature, a significant subset can be linked to either dominant or recessive germ line mutations. PARK2, encoding the ubiquitin ligase parkin, is the most frequently mutated gene in hereditary Parkinson's disease. Here, we present evidence for a neuronal ubiquitin ligase cascade involving parkin and the multisubunit ubiquitin ligase SCFFbw7β. Specifically, parkin targets the SCF substrate adapter Fbw7β for proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, we show that the physiological role of parkin-mediated regulation of Fbw7β levels is the stabilization of the mitochondrial prosurvival factor Mcl-1, an SCFFbw7β target in neurons. We show that neurons depleted of parkin become acutely sensitive to oxidative stress due to an inability to maintain adequate levels of Mcl-1. Therefore, loss of parkin function through biallelic mutation of PARK2 may lead to death of dopaminergic neurons through unregulated SCFFbw7β-mediated ubiquitylation-dependent proteolysis of Mcl-1.",

The toxicity is related to a poor zinc endopeptidase activity located in a 50-kDa domain known as light chain (Lc) of the toxin. The C-terminal tail of Lc is not visible in any of the currently available x-ray structures, and it has no known function but undergoes autocatalytic truncations during purification and storage. By synthesizing C-terminal peptides of various lengths, in this study, we have shown that these peptides competitively inhibit the normal catalytic activity of Lc of serotype A (LcA) and have defined the length of the mature LcA to consist of the first 444 residues. Two catalytically inactive mutants also inhibited LcA activity. Our results suggested that the C terminus of LcA might interact at or near its own active site. By using synthetic C-terminal peptides from LcB, LcC1, LcD, LcE, and LcF and their respective substrate peptides, we have shown that the inhibition of activity is specific only for LcA. Although a potent inhibitor with a Ki of 4.5 μm, the largest of our LcA C-terminal peptides stimulated LcA activity when added at near-stoichiometric concentration to three versions of LcA differing in their C-terminal lengths. The result suggested a product removal role of the LcA C terminus. This suggestion is supported by a weak but specific interaction determined by isothermal titration calorimetry between an LcA C-terminal peptide and N-terminal product from a peptide substrate of LcA. Our results also underscore the importance of using a mature LcA as an inhibitor screening target.",Botulinum Toxin;Enzyme Mechanisms;Enzyme Structure;Metalloprotease;Neurotoxin;Peptide Interactions;Protein Chemistry;C Terminus;Zinc Endopeptidase

It has been speculated that securin also supports the activation of separase. In this study, we found that PTTG1 was the major securin isoform expressed in most normal and cancer cell lines. Remarkably, a highly homologous isoform called PTTG2 was unable to interact with separase. Using chimeras between PTTG1 and PTTG2 and other approaches, we pinpointed a single amino acid that accounted for the loss of securin function in PTTG2. Mutation of the homologous position in PTTG1 (H134) switched PTTG1 from an inhibitor into an activator of separase. In agreement with this, PTTG1 lacking H134 was able to trigger premature sister chromatid separation. Conversely, introduction of H134 into PTTG2 is sufficient to allow it to bind separase. These data demonstrate that while the motif containing H134 has a strong affinity for separase and is involved in inhibiting it, another domain(s) is involved in activating separase and has a weaker affinity for it. Although PTTG2 lacks securin function, its differences from PTTG1 provide evidence of independent inhibitory and activating functions of PTTG1 on separase.",

Human translin functions as an octamer, but in the octameric crystallographic structure, the residues responsible for nucleic acid binding are not accessible. Moreover, electron microscopy data reveal very different octameric configurations. Consequently, the functional assembly and the mechanism of nucleic acid binding by the protein remain unclear. Here, we present an integrative study combining small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), site-directed mutagenesis, biochemical analysis and computational techniques to address these questions. Our data indicate a significant conformational heterogeneity for translin in solution, formed by a lesser-populated compact octameric state resembling the previously solved X-ray structure, and a highly populated open octameric state that had not been previously identified. On the other hand, our SAXS data and computational analyses of translin in complex with the RNA oligonucleotide (GU)12 show that the internal cavity found in the octameric assemblies can accommodate different nucleic acid conformations. According to this model, the nucleic acid binding residues become accessible for binding, which facilitates the entrance of the nucleic acids into the cavity. Our data thus provide a structural basis for the functions that translin performs in RNA metabolism and transport.",

Despite evidence that the Norwalk virus (NV) minor structural protein VP2 is present in infectious virions, the available crystallographic and electron cryomicroscopy structures of NV have not revealed the location of VP2. In this study, we determined that VP1 associates with VP2 at the interior surface of the capsid, specifically with the shell (S) domain of VP1. We mapped the interaction site to amino acid 52 of VP1, an isoleucine located within a sequence motif IDPWI in the S domain that is highly conserved across norovirus genogroups. Mutation of this isoleucine abrogated VP2 incorporation into virus-like particles without affecting the ability for VP1 to dimerize and form particles. The highly basic nature of VP2 and its location interior to the viral particle are consistent with its potential role in assisting capsid assembly and genome encapsidation.",

Here, the structural effects of drebrin on F-actin were examined in solution. Depolymerization and differential scanning calorimetry assays show that F-actin is stabilized by the binding of drebrin. Drebrin inhibits depolymerization mainly at the barbed end of F-actin. Full-length drebrin and its C-terminal truncated constructs were used to clarify the domain requirements for these effects. The actin binding domain of drebrin decreases the intrastrand disulfide cross-linking of Cys-41 (in the DNase I binding loop) to Cys-374 (C-terminal) but increases the interstrand disulfide cross-linking of Cys-265 (hydrophobic loop) to Cys-374 in the yeast mutants Q41C and S265C, respectively. We also demonstrate, using solution biochemistry methods and EM, the rescue of filament formation by drebrin in different cases of longitudinal interprotomer contact perturbation: the T203C/C374S yeast actin mutant and grimelysin-cleaved skeletal actin (between Gly-42 and Val-43). Additionally, we show that drebrin rescues the polymerization of V266G/L267G, a hydrophobic loop yeast actin mutant with an impaired lateral interface formation between the two filament strands. Overall, our data suggest that drebrin stabilizes actin filaments through its effect on their interstrand and intrastrand contacts.",Actin;Cytoskeleton;Electron Microscopy (EM);Protein Complexes;Protein Cross-linking;Protein Dynamics;Protein Stability

Entirely new approaches may be required, motivating an analysis of the fundamental physical constraints on the problem. We outline the physical principles governing brain activity mapping using optical, electrical, magnetic resonance, and molecular modalities of neural recording. Focusing on the mouse brain, we analyze the scalability of each method, concentrating on the limitations imposed by spatiotemporal resolution, energy dissipation, and volume displacement. Based on this analysis, all existing approaches require orders of magnitude improvement in key parameters. Electrical recording is limited by the low multiplexing capacity of electrodes and their lack of intrinsic spatial resolution, optical methods are constrained by the scattering of visible light in brain tissue, magnetic resonance is hindered by the diffusion and relaxation timescales of water protons, and the implementation of molecular recording is complicated by the stochastic kinetics of enzymes. Understanding the physical limits of brain activity mapping may provide insight into opportunities for novel solutions. For example, unconventional methods for delivering electrodes may enable unprecedented numbers of recording sites, embedded optical devices could allow optical detectors to be placed within a few scattering lengths of the measured neurons, and new classes of molecularly engineered sensors might obviate cumbersome hardware architectures. We also study the physics of powering and communicating with microscale devices embedded in brain tissue and find that, while radio-frequency electromagnetic data transmission suffers from a severe power–bandwidth tradeoff, communication via infrared light or ultrasound may allow high data rates due to the possibility of spatial multiplexing. The use of embedded local recording and wireless data transmission would only be viable, however, given major improvements to the power efficiency of microelectronic devices.",neural recording;brain activity mapping;electrical recording;optical methods;magnetic resonance imaging;molecular recording;embedded electronics

A significant increase in branchial caspase-3/-7 activity was observed on day 4 (salinity 20), and an extensive TUNEL-positive apoptosis was detected on day 5 (salinity 25), indicating salinity-induced apoptosis had occurred. This was further supported by an up-regulation of branchial mRNA expression of p53, a key regulator of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, between day 2 (salinity 10) and day 6 (seawater), and an increase in branchial p53 protein abundance on day 6. Seawater acclimation apparently activated both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, as reflected by significant increases in branchial caspase-8 and caspase-9 activities. The involvement of the intrinsic pathway was confirmed by the significant increase in branchial mRNA expression of bax between day 4 (salinity 20) and day 6 (seawater). Western blotting results revealed the presence of a freshwater Na+/K+-ATPase (Nka) α-isoform, Nka α1a, and a seawater isoform, Nka α1b, the protein abundance of which decreased and increased, respectively, during seawater acclimation. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed the presence of two types of MRCs distinctly different in sizes, and confirmed that the reduction in Nka α1a expression, and the prominent increases in expression of Nka α1b, Na+:K+:2Cl− cotransporter 1, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Cl− channel coincided with the salinity-induced apoptotic event. Since modulation of existing MRCs alone could not have led to extensive salinity-induced apoptosis, it is probable that some, if not all, freshwater-type MRCs could have been removed through increased apoptosis and subsequently replaced by seawater-type MRCs in the gills of A. testudineus during seawater acclimation.",air-breathing fish;Na+/K+-ATPase;Na+:K+:2Cl− cotransporter;osmoregulation;seawater adaptation;TUNEL

Although p53 SUMOylation promotes its nuclear export, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here we show that tethering of a small, ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) moiety to p53 markedly increases its cytoplasmic localization. SUMO attachment to p53 does not affect its oligomerization, suggesting that subunit dissociation required for exposing p53’s nuclear export signal (NES) is unnecessary for p53 nuclear export. Surprisingly, SUMO-mediated p53 nuclear export depends on the SUMO-interacting motif (SIM)-binding pocket of SUMO-1. The CRM1 C-terminal domain lacking the NES-binding groove interacts with tetrameric p53, and the proper folding of the p53 core domain, rather than the presence of the N- or C-terminal tails, appears to be important for p53–CRM1 interaction. The CRM1 Huntington, EF3, a subunit of PP2A, and TOR1 9 (HEAT9) loop, which regulates GTP-binding nuclear protein Ran binding and cargo release, contains a prototypical SIM. Remarkably, disruption of this SIM in conjunction with a mutated SIM-binding groove of SUMO-1 markedly enhances the binding of CRM1 to p53-SUMO-1 and their accumulation in the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), as well as their persistent association in the cytoplasm. We propose that SUMOylation of a CRM1 cargo such as p53 at the NPCs unlocks the HEAT9 loop of CRM1 to facilitate the disassembly of the transporting complex and cargo release to the cytoplasm.",

Many of these structures behave as condensed liquid-like phases of the cytoplasm/nucleoplasm. The phase transitions that appear to govern their assembly exhibit an intrinsic dependence on cell size, and may explain the size scaling reported for a number of structures.

d ≃ 2.5–4.9 nM) than most if not all other known peptide sequences. Crystallographic analysis at 1.75 Å resolution shows that the SBP-Tag binds to streptavidin in an unprecedented manner by simultaneously interacting with biotin-binding pockets from two separate subunits. An N-­terminal HVV peptide sequence (residues 12–14) and a C-­terminal HPQ sequence (residues 31–33) form the bulk of the direct interactions between the SBP-Tag and the two biotin-binding pockets. Surprisingly, most of the peptide spanning these two sites (residues 17–28) adopts a regular α-­helical structure that projects three leucine side chains into a groove formed at the interface between two streptavidin protomers. The crystal structure shows that residues 1–10 and 35–38 of the original SBP-Tag identified through in vitro selection and deletion analysis do not appear to contact streptavidin and thus may not be important for binding. A 25-­residue peptide comprising residues 11–34 (SBP-Tag2) was synthesized and shown using surface plasmon resonance to bind streptavidin with very similar affinity and kinetics when compared with the SBP-Tag.

To accomplish those goals, small molecules need to target those protein residues that contribute the most to binding (binding hotspots) without disturbing those residues that initiate signaling processes (allosteric hotspots). The availability of a blueprint identifying binding and allosteric hotspots will significantly aid inhibitor design and optimization. In this paper, we show that in some situations the blueprint can be constructed by combining the standard technique of alanine scanning mutagenesis with isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). We demonstrate the approach by developing the combined binding and allosteric hotspots blueprint for CD4/gp120, the initial interaction leading to HIV-1 cell infection. A major finding of these studies is that not all binding hotspots are allosteric hotspots opening the possibility for the rational design of inhibitors and antagonist or agonist modulators.",Binding Affinity;Enthalpy;Entropy;Thermodynamic Optimization;Isothermal Titration Calorimetry;Alanine Scanning Mutagenesis

The most likely orientations of Gβ1γ2 and the Gαiβ1γ2 heterotrimer were both determined to fall within a similar narrow range of twist and tilt angles, suggesting that Gβ1γ2 may bind to Gαi without a significant change in orientation. This “basal” orientation seems to depend primarily on the geranylgeranylated C-terminus of Gγ2 along with basic residues at the N-terminus of Gαi, and suggests that activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) must reorient G protein heterotrimers at lipid bilayers to catalyze nucleotide exchange.

Polymerizing actin pushes against the cell membrane and induces dramatic edge protrusions. In order to properly control such changes in cell morphology and function, cells have evolved multiple methods to tightly regulate WRC and Arp2/3 activity in space and time. Of these mechanisms, phosphorylation plays a fundamental role in transmitting extracellular and intracellular signals to the WRC and the actin cytoskeleton. This review discusses the phosphorylation-based regulatory inputs into the WRC. Signaling pathways that respond to growth factors, chemokines, hormones, and extracellular matrix converge upon the WAVE and ABI components of the WRC. The Abl, Src, ERK, and PKA kinases promote complex activation through a WRC conformation change that permits interaction with the Arp2/3 complex and through WRC translocation to the cell edge. The neuron-specific CDK5 and constitutively active CK2 kinases inhibit WRC activation. These regulatory signals are integrated in space and time as they coalesce upon the WRC. The combination of WRC phosphorylation events and WRC activity is controlled by stimulus, cell type, and cell cycle-specific pathway activation and via pathway cross-inhibition and cross-activation.",Abl;Ableson-interacting protein (ABI);Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5);Extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK);phosphorylation;WASp-family verprolin homologous protein (WAVE)

Additionally, N protein participates in at least one stage of the complex mechanism of coronavirus RNA synthesis. We previously uncovered an unanticipated interaction between N and the largest subunit of the viral replicase-transcriptase complex, nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). This was found through analysis of revertants of a severely defective mutant of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) in which the N gene was replaced with that of its close relative, bovine coronavirus (BCoV). In the work reported here, we constructed BCoV chimeras and other mutants of MHV nsp3 and obtained complementary genetic evidence for its association with N protein. We found that the N-nsp3 interaction maps to the amino-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of nsp3, which is essential for the virus. The interaction does not require the adjacent acidic domain of nsp3, which is dispensable. In addition, we demonstrated a complete correspondence between N-nsp3 genetic interactions and the ability of N protein to enhance the infectivity of transfected coronavirus genomic RNA. The latter function of N was shown to depend on both of the RNA-binding domains of N, as well as on the serine- and arginine-rich central region of N, which binds nsp3. Our results support a model in which the N-nsp3 interaction serves to tether the genome to the newly translated replicase-transcriptase complex at a very early stage of infection.",

The cofactor forms by reaction of MnII/FeII-β2 with O2. Previously, in vitro cofactor assembly from apo β2 and divalent metal ions produced a mixture of two forms, with Mn in site 1 (MnIV/FeIII) or site 2 (FeIII/MnIV), of which the more active MnIV/FeIII product predominates. Here we have addressed the basis for metal site-selectivity by solving X-ray crystal structures of apo, MnII, and MnII/FeII complexes of Ct β2. A structure obtained anaerobically with equimolar MnII, FeII, and apo protein reveals exclusive incorporation of MnII in site 1 and FeII in site 2, in contrast to the more modest site-selectivity achieved previously. Site-specificity is controlled thermodynamically by the apo protein structure, as only minor adjustments of ligands occur upon metal binding. Additional structures imply that, by itself, MnII binds in either site. Together the structures are consistent with a model for in vitro cofactor assembly in which FeII specificity for site 2 drives assembly of the appropriately configured heterobimetallic center, provided that FeII is substoichiometric. This model suggests that use of an MnIV/FeIII cofactor in vivo could be an adaptation to FeII limitation. A 1.8 Å resolution model of the MnII/FeII-β2 complex reveals additional structural determinants for activation of the cofactor, including a proposed site for side-on (η2) addition of O2 to FeII and a short (3.2 Å) MnII-FeII interionic distance, promoting formation of the MnIV/FeIV activation intermediate.",

We here focus on emerging options to interfere with the influenza virus entry process, which consists of the following steps: attachment of the viral hemagglutinin to the sialylated host cell receptors, endocytosis, M2‐mediated uncoating, low pH‐induced membrane fusion, and, finally, import of the viral ribonucleoprotein into the nucleus. We review the current functional and structural insights in the viral and cellular components of this entry process, and the diverse antiviral strategies that are being explored. This encompasses small molecule inhibitors as well as macromolecules such as therapeutic antibodies.

This structure suggests that α4 binding to the full-length PP2Ac requires local unfolding near the active site, which perturbs the scaffold subunit binding site at the opposite surface via allosteric relay. These changes stabilize an inactive conformation of PP2Ac and convert oligomeric PP2A complexes to the α4 complex upon perturbation of the active site.

","Genetic disorders of the Ras/MAPK pathway, termed RASopathies, produce numerous abnormalities, including cutaneous keratodermas. The desmosomal cadherin, desmoglein-1 (DSG1), promotes keratinocyte differentiation by attenuating MAPK/ERK signaling and is linked to striate palmoplantar keratoderma (SPPK). This raises the possibility that cutaneous defects associated with SPPK and RASopathies share certain molecular faults. To identify intermediates responsible for executing the inhibition of ERK by DSG1, we conducted a yeast 2-hybrid screen. The screen revealed that Erbin (also known as ERBB2IP), a known ERK regulator, binds DSG1. Erbin silencing disrupted keratinocyte differentiation in culture, mimicking aspects of DSG1 deficiency. Furthermore, ERK inhibition and the induction of differentiation markers by DSG1 required both Erbin and DSG1 domains that participate in binding Erbin. Erbin blocks ERK signaling by interacting with and disrupting Ras-Raf scaffolds mediated by SHOC2, a protein genetically linked to the RASopathy, Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair (NS/LAH). DSG1 overexpression enhanced this inhibitory function, increasing Erbin-SHOC2 interactions and decreasing Ras-SHOC2 interactions. Conversely, analysis of epidermis from DSG1-deficient patients with SPPK demonstrated increased Ras-SHOC2 colocalization and decreased Erbin-SHOC2 colocalization, offering a possible explanation for the observed epidermal defects. These findings suggest a mechanism by which DSG1 and Erbin cooperate to repress MAPK signaling and promote keratinocyte differentiation.",

Consequently, specialized Y-family DNA polymerases are used to bypass DNA damage. The protein UmuD is extensively involved in modulating cellular responses to DNA damage and may play a role in DNA polymerase exchange for damage tolerance. In the absence of DNA, UmuD interacts with the α subunit of DNA polymerase III at two distinct binding sites, one of which is adjacent to the single-stranded DNA-binding site of α. Here, we use single molecule DNA stretching experiments to demonstrate that UmuD specifically inhibits binding of α to ssDNA. We predict using molecular modeling that UmuD residues D91 and G92 are involved in this interaction and demonstrate that mutation of these residues disrupts the interaction. Our results suggest that competition between UmuD and ssDNA for α binding is a new mechanism for polymerase exchange.",

Amyloid fibril formation by structurally and functionally unrelated proteins exhibits many generic characteristics, most prominently the cross β-sheet structure of their mature fibrils. At the same time, amyloid formation tends to proceed along one of two separate assembly pathways yielding either stiff monomeric filaments or globular oligomers and curvilinear protofibrils. Given the focus on oligomers as major toxic species, the very existence of an oligomer-free assembly pathway is significant. Little is known, though, about the structure of the various intermediates emerging along different pathways and whether the pathways converge towards a common or distinct fibril structures. Using infrared spectroscopy we probed the structural evolution of intermediates and late-stage fibrils formed during in vitro lysozyme amyloid assembly along an oligomeric and oligomer-free pathway. Infrared spectroscopy confirmed that both pathways produced amyloid-specific β-sheet peaks, but at pathway-specific wavenumbers. We further found that the amyloid-specific dye thioflavin T responded to all intermediates along either pathway. The relative amplitudes of thioflavin T fluorescence responses displayed pathway-specific differences and could be utilized for monitoring the structural evolution of intermediates. Pathway-specific structural features obtained from infrared spectroscopy and Thioflavin T responses were identical for fibrils grown at highly acidic or at physiological pH values and showed no discernible effects of protein hydrolysis. Our results suggest that late-stage fibrils formed along either pathway are amyloidogenic in nature, but have distinguishable structural fingerprints. These pathway-specific fingerprints emerge during the earliest aggregation events and persist throughout the entire cascade of aggregation intermediates formed along each pathway.",

years, it has been popularly believed that viral dsDNA-packaging apparatuses are
pentameric rotation motors. Recently, a third class of hexameric motor has been
found in bacteriophage phi29 that utilizes a mechanism of revolution without
rotation, friction, coiling, or torque. This review addresses how packaging
motors control dsDNA one-way traffic; how four electropositive layers in the
channel interact with the electronegative phosphate backbone to generate four
steps in translocating one dsDNA helix; how motors resolve the mismatch between
10.5 bases and 12 connector subunits per cycle of revolution; and how ATP
regulates sequential action of motor ATPase. Since motors with all number of
subunits can utilize the revolution mechanism, this finding helps resolve
puzzles and debates concerning the oligomeric nature of packaging motors in many
phage systems. This revolution mechanism helps to solve the undesirable dsDNA

Ubiquitous microcalpain (μ-calpain) and millicalpain (m-calpain) are heterodimers composed of catalytic subunits encoded, respectively, by CAPN1 and CAPN2 and a regulatory subunit encoded by CAPNS1. Here we show that calpain is required for the stability of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP1 in several cell lines. USP1 modulates DNA replication polymerase choice and repair by deubiquitinating PCNA. The ubiquitinated form of the USP1 substrate PCNA is stabilized in CAPNS1-depleted U2OS cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), favoring polymerase-η loading on chromatin and increased mutagenesis. USP1 degradation directed by the cell cycle regulator APC/Ccdh1, which marks USP1 for destruction in the G1 phase, is upregulated in CAPNS1-depleted cells. USP1 stability can be rescued upon forced expression of calpain-activated Cdk5/p25, previously reported as a cdh1 repressor. These data suggest that calpain stabilizes USP1 by activating Cdk5, which in turn inhibits cdh1 and, consequently, USP1 degradation. Altogether these findings point to a connection between the calpain system and the ubiquitin pathway in the regulation of DNA damage response and place calpain at the interface between cell cycle modulation and DNA repair.",

We have used this model to predict thioamide quenching of various common fluorophores, and we rigorously tested more than a dozen examples. In each case, we found excellent agreement between our theoretical predictions and experimental observations. In this way, we have been able to expand the scope of fluorophores quenched by thioamides to include dyes suitable for microscopy and single molecule studies, including fluorescein, Alexa Fluor 488, BODIPY FL, and rhodamine 6G.

The onco-Lbc protein is a hyperactive Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), but its structural mechanism has not been reported despite its involvement in cardiac hypertrophy and cancer causation. The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Lbc is located at the C-terminal end of the protein and is shown here to specifically recognize activated RhoA rather than lipids. The isolated dbl homology (DH) domain can function as an independent activator with an enhanced activity. However, the DH domain normally does not act as a solitary Lbc interface with RhoA-GDP. Instead it is negatively controlled by the PH domain. In particular, the DH helical bundle is coupled to the structurally dependent PH domain through a helical linker, which reduces its activity. Together the two domains form a rigid scaffold in solution as evidenced by small angle x-ray scattering and 1H,13C,15N-based NMR spectroscopy. The two domains assume a “chair” shape with its back possessing independent GEF activity and the PH domain providing a broad seat for RhoA-GTP docking rather than membrane recognition. This provides structural and dynamical insights into how DH and PH domains work together in solution to support regulated RhoA activity. Mutational analysis supports the bifunctional PH domain mediation of DH-RhoA interactions and explains why the tandem domain is required for controlled GEF signaling.",GTPase;Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF);Nuclear Magnetic Resonance;Oncogene;Protein Structure;Protein-Protein Interaction;Ras Homolog Gene Family;Member A (RhoA);Rho GTPases;AKAP;Lbc

Like many homeodomain transcription factors, Pdx1 binds to a core DNA recognition sequence containing the tetranucleotide 5´-TAAT-3´; its consensus recognition element is 5´-CTCTAAT(T/G)AG-3´. Currently, a complete thermodynamic profile of Pdx1 binding to near-consensus and native promoter sequences has not been established, obscuring the mechanism of target site selection by this critical transcription factor. Strikingly, while Pdx1 responsive elements in the human insulin promoter conform to the pentanucleotide 5´-CTAAT-3´ sequence, the Pdx1 responsive elements in the human iapp promoter all contain a substitution to 5-TTAAT-3´. The crystal structure of Pdx1 bound to the consensus nucleotide sequence does not explain how Pdx1 identifies this natural variation, if it does at all. Here we report a combination of isothermal calorimetric titrations, NMR spectroscopy, and extensive multi-microsecond molecular dynamics calculations of Pdx1 that define its interactions with a panel of natural promoter elements and consensus-derived sequences. Our results show a small preference of Pdx1 for a Cyt base 5´ relative to the core TAAT promoter element. Molecular mechanics calculations, corroborated by experimental NMR data, lead to a rational explanation for sequence discrimination at this position. Taken together, our results suggest a molecular mechanism for differential Pdx1 affinity to elements from the insulin and iapp promoter sequences.",homeodomain;A-box element;diabetes;isothermal titration calorimetry;nuclear magnetic resonance

The link between senescence and tumor suppression supports the hypothesis that a loss-of-function screen measuring bona fide senescence marker activation should identify candidate tumor suppressors. Using a high-content siRNA screening assay for cell morphology and proliferation measures, we identify 12 senescence-regulating kinases and determine their senescence marker signatures, including elevation of senescence-associated β-galactosidase, DNA damage and p53 or p16INK4a expression. Consistent with our hypothesis, SNP array CGH data supports loss of gene copy number of five senescence-suppressing genes across multiple tumor samples. One such candidate is the EPHA3 receptor tyrosine kinase, a gene commonly mutated in human cancer. We demonstrate that selected intracellular EPHA3 tumor-associated point mutations decrease receptor expression level and/or receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity. Our study therefore describes a new strategy to mine for novel candidate tumor suppressors and provides compelling evidence that EPHA3 mutations may promote tumorigenesis only when key senescence-inducing pathways have been inactivated.",DDR;EPHA3;RTK;p16INK4a;p53;senescence;tumor suppressor

This study investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms of MPA’s anticancer activity. Methods: A gastric cancer cell line (AGS) was treated with MPA and gene expression at different time points was analyzed using Illumina whole genome microarrays and selected genes were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Results: Transcriptomic profiling identified 1070 genes with ≥2 fold changes and 85 genes with >4 fold alterations. The most significantly altered biological processes by MPA treatment include cell cycle, apoptosis, cell proliferation and migration. MPA treatment altered at least ten KEGG pathways, of which eight (p53 signaling, cell cycle, pathways in cancer, PPAR signaling, bladder cancer, protein processing in ER, small cell lung cancer and MAPK signaling) are cancer-related. Among the earliest cellular events induced by MPA is cell cycle arrest which may be caused by six molecular pathways: 1) up-regulation of cyclins (CCND1 and CCNE2) and down-regulation of CCNA2 and CCNB1, 2) down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4 and CDK5); 3) inhibition of cell division related genes (CDC20, CDC25B and CDC25C) and other cell cycle related genes (MCM2, CENPE and PSRC1), 4) activation of p53, which activates the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKN1A), 5) impaired spindle checkpoint function and chromosome segregation (BUB1, BUB1B, BOP1, AURKA, AURKB, and FOXM1); and 6) reduction of availability of deoxyribonucleotides and therefore DNA synthesis through down-regulation of the RRM1 enzyme. Cell cycle arrest is followed by inhibition of cell proliferation, which is mainly attributable to the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and caspase-dependent apoptosis due to up-regulation of the p53 and FAS pathways. Conclusions: These results suggest that MPA has beneficial anticancer activity through diverse molecular pathways and biological processes.",MPA;drug repurposing;regulatory networks;microarray

genes that cause familial Parkinson’s disease (PD). Importantly, the functional characterization of these genes has
shed considerable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the etiology and pathogenesis of PD. Collectively;
these studies implicate aberrant protein and mitochondrial homeostasis as key contributors to the development of PD, with
oxidative stress likely acting as an important nexus between the two pathogenic events. Interestingly, recent genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) have revealed variations in at least two of the identified familial PD genes (i.e. α-synuclein
and LRRK2) as significant risk factors for the development of sporadic PD. At the same time, the studies also uncovered
variability in novel alleles that is associated with increased risk for the disease. Additionally, in-silico meta-analyses of
GWAS data have allowed major steps into the investigation of the roles of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions
in sporadic PD. The emergent picture from the progress made thus far is that the etiology of sporadic PD is multi-factorial

Consequently, compounds counteracting amyloid aggregation have been investigated for their ability (i) to stabilize toxic amyloid precursors; (ii) to prevent the growth of toxic oligomers or speed that of fibrils; (iii) to inhibit fibril growth and deposition; (iv) to disassemble preformed fibrils; and (v) to favor amyloid clearance. Natural phenols, a wide panel of plant molecules, are one of the most actively investigated categories of potential amyloid inhibitors. They are considered responsible for the beneficial effects of several traditional diets being present in green tea, extra virgin olive oil, red wine, spices, berries and aromatic herbs. Accordingly, it has been proposed that some natural phenols could be exploited to prevent and to treat amyloid diseases, and recent studies have provided significant information on their ability to inhibit peptide/protein aggregation in various ways and to stimulate cell defenses, leading to identify shared or specific mechanisms. In the first part of this review, we will overview the significance and mechanisms of amyloid aggregation and aggregate toxicity; then, we will summarize the recent achievements on protection against amyloid diseases by many natural phenols.",amyloid;amyloid aggregation;polyphenols;natural phenols

Franck;Anna Pavlova;John A. Scott;Songi Han,"Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA","Among other reasons, the different methods for calculating the saturation factor have caused a separation of ODNP into two different methods or strategies. Each variant has – until now – also generated different quantitative results: One variant (cw ODNP) retrieves the necessary information from the NMR signal while relying solely on the use of a cw microwave source that saturates the ESR transition (as in Refs. [8, 17, 33]), while the other (ELDOR-assisted ODNP) relies at least partially on the ability to apply microwave pulses and detect the resulting ESR free induction decay or spin echo (as in Refs. [3]). ELDOR-assisted ODNP has shown promise by rectifying the value for the bulk coupling factor (i.e. for bulk water near a small, freely dissolved nitroxide probe molecule), yielding results that agree more closely with the predictions of field cycling relaxometry (FCR) [8, 30] and molecular dynamics (MD) [34] studies. Meanwhile, various recent studies have shown that the more widely accessible cw ODNP variant shows promise as a routine approach for the determination of local hydration dynamics [8, 10–12]. Thus far, only the cw ODNP method has been applied to the quantification of hydration water dynamics in biological and soft matter systems. However, a controversy over the accuracy of cw ODNP has persisted because it was believed to report a value of the bulk coupling factor [8] that strongly disagreed with the value predicted from FCR results or the value observed by ELDOR-assisted ODNP.",

By investigating the details of this model, crystallographers seek to obtain insight into the function of the macromolecule. It is therefore important to know which details of a protein structure are reproducible or to what extent they might differ. To address this question, the high-resolution structures of five crystals of bovine trypsin obtained under analogous conditions were compared. Global parameters and structural details were investigated. All of the models were of similar quality and the pairwise merged intensities had large correlation coefficients. The Cα and backbone atoms of the structures superposed very well. The occupancy of ligands in regions of low thermal motion was reproducible, whereas solvent molecules containing heavier atoms (such as sulfur) or those located on the surface could differ significantly. The coordination lengths of the calcium ion were conserved. A large proportion of the multiple conformations refined to similar occupancies and the residues adopted similar orientations. More than three quarters of the water-molecule sites were conserved within 0.5 Å and more than one third were conserved within 0.1 Å. An investigation of the protonation states of histidine residues and carboxylate moieties was consistent for all of the models. Radiation-damage effects to disulfide bridges were observed for the same residues and to similar extents. Main-chain bond lengths and angles averaged to similar values and were in agreement with the Engh and Huber targets. Other features, such as peptide flips and the double conformation of the inhibitor molecule, were also reproducible in all of the trypsin structures. Therefore, many details are similar in models obtained from different crystals. However, several features of residues or ligands located in flexible parts of the macromolecule may vary significantly, such as side-chain orientations and the occupancies of certain fragments.",atomic resolution;structure comparison;trypsin;structural reproducibility

Using NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that this marginally-stable helix is unfolded, and not displaced to a non-inhibitory position, when ETV6 is bound to DNA containing a consensus 5’GGAA3’ recognition site. Although significantly lower in affinity, binding to non-specific DNA is auto-inhibited ~ 5-fold and also accompanied by helix unfolding. Based on NMR chemical shift perturbations, both specific and non-specific DNA are bound via the same canonical ETS domain interface. However, spectral perturbations are smaller for the non-specific complex, suggesting weaker and less well-defined interactions than in the specific complex. In parallel, the crystal structure of ETV6 bound to a specific DNA duplex was determined. The structure of this complex reveals that a non-conserved histidine residue in the ETS domain recognition helix helps establish the specificity of ETV6 for DNA-binding sites containing 5’GGAA3’ versus 5’GGAT3’. These studies provide a unified steric mechanism for attenuating ETV6 binding to both specific and non-specific DNA and expand the repertoire of characterized auto-inhibitory strategies utilized to regulate ETS factors.",Inhibitory module;helix unfolding;protein-DNA interface;ETS family;winged helix-turn-helix

The eradication of H. pylori is the standard care for patients with gastric MALT lymphoma. Cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) protein, one of the most extensively studied H. pylori virulence factors, is strongly associated with the gastric MALT lymphoma. CagA possesses polymorphisms according to its C-terminal structure and displays different functions among areas and races. After being translocated into B lymphocytes via type IV secretion system, CagA deregulates intracellular signaling pathways in both tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent and -independent manners and/or some other pathways, and thereby promotes lymphomagenesis.

These maladies are referred to as amyloid diseases, because they are named after the cross-β-sheet amyloid fibril aggregates or deposits common to these diseases. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the principal polyphenol present in green tea, has been shown to be effective at preventing aggregation and is able to remodel amyloid fibrils comprising different amyloidogenic proteins, although the mechanistic underpinnings are unclear. Herein, we work towards an understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) by which EGCG remodels mature amyloid fibrils made up of Aβ1–40, IAPP8–24, or Sup35NM7–16. We show that EGCG amyloid remodeling activity in vitro is dependent on auto-oxidation of the EGCG. Oxidized and unoxidized EGCG binds to amyloid fibrils, preventing the binding of thioflavin T. This engagement of the hydrophobic binding sites in Aβ1–40, IAPP8–24, or Sup35NM7–16 amyloid fibrils seems to be sufficient to explain the majority of the amyloid remodeling observed by EGCG treatment, although how EGCG oxidation drives remodeling remains unclear. Oxidized EGCG molecules react with free amines within the amyloid fibril through the formation of Schiff bases, cross-linking the fibrils, which may prevent dissociation and toxicity, but these aberrant post-translational modifications do not appear to be the major driving force for amyloid remodeling by EGCG treatment. These insights into the molecular mechanism of action of EGCG provide boundary conditions for exploring amyloid remodeling in more detail.",

Small molecules (<40 kDa) diffuse through the large pore of this multiprotein complex. A passively impermeable macromolecule tagged with a signal peptide is chaperoned through the nanopore by nuclear transport receptors (e.g., importins) owing to their interactions with barrier-forming proteins. Presently, this bimodal transport mechanism is not well understood and is described by controversial models. Herein, we report on a dynamic and spatially resolved mechanism for NPC-mediated molecular transport through nanoscale central and peripheral routes with distinct permeabilities. Specifically, we develop a nanogap-based approach of scanning electrochemical microscopy to precisely measure the extremely high permeability of the nuclear envelope to a small probe molecule, (ferrocenylmethyl)trimethylammonium. Effective medium theories indicate that the passive permeability of 5.9 × 10−2 cm/s corresponds to the free diffusion of the probe molecule through ~22 nanopores with a radius of 24 nm and a length of 35 nm. Peripheral routes are blocked by wheat germ agglutinin to yield two-fold lower permeability for 17 nm-radius central routes. This lectin is also used in fluorescence assays to find that importins facilitate the transport of signal-tagged albumin mainly through the 7 nm-thick peripheral route rather than through the sufficiently large central route. We propose that this spatial selectivity is regulated by the conformational changes in barrier-forming proteins that transiently and locally expand the impermeably thin peripheral route while blocking the central route.",

Mediator and pol II function within the pre-initiation complex (PIC), which consists of Mediator, pol II, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF and TFIIH and is approximately 4.0 MDa in size. Mediator serves as a central scaffold within the PIC and helps regulate pol II activity in ways that remain poorly understood. Mediator is also generally targeted by sequence-specific, DNA-binding transcription factors (TFs) that work to control gene expression programs in response to developmental or environmental cues. At a basic level, Mediator functions by relaying signals from TFs directly to the pol II enzyme, thereby facilitating TF-dependent regulation of gene expression. Thus, Mediator is essential for converting biological inputs (communicated by TFs) to physiological responses (via changes in gene expression). In this review, we summarize an expansive body of research on the Mediator complex, with an emphasis on yeast and mammalian complexes. We focus on the basics that underlie Mediator function, such as its structure and subunit composition, and describe its broad regulatory influence on gene expression, ranging from chromatin architecture to transcription initiation and elongation, to mRNA processing.

E-mail ude.uhj@nosdoows","Assembly of bacterial 30S ribosomal subunits requires structural rearrangements to both its 16S rRNA and ribosomal protein components. Ribosomal protein S4 nucleates 30S assembly and associates rapidly with the 5′ domain of the 16S rRNA. In vitro, transformation of initial S4–rRNA complexes to long-lived, mature complexes involves refolding of 16S helix 18, which forms part of the decoding center. Here we use targeted mutagenesis of Geobacillus stearothermophilus S4 to show that remodeling of S4–rRNA complexes is perturbed by ram alleles associated with reduced translational accuracy. Gel mobility shift assays, SHAPE chemical probing, and in vivo complementation show that the S4 N-terminal extension is required for RNA binding and viability. Alanine substitutions in Y47 and L51 that interact with 16S helix 18 decrease S4 affinity and destabilize the helix 18 pseudoknot. These changes to the protein–RNA interface correlate with no growth (L51A) or cold-sensitive growth, 30S assembly defects, and accumulation of 17S pre-rRNA (Y47A). A third mutation, R200A, over-stabilizes the helix 18 pseudoknot yet results in temperature-sensitive growth, indicating that complex stability is finely tuned by natural selection. Our results show that early S4–RNA interactions guide rRNA folding and impact late steps of 30S assembly.",ribosome assembly;ribosomal protein S4;SHAPE;α-operon;pseudoknot;RNA–protein interaction

Circular dichroism analyses revealed that the His-loop partly consists of a polyproline type II structure and that its conformational change is induced by Zn2+ as well as the C-terminal domain. Isothermal titration calorimetry of the His-loop revealed a binding number of four Zn2+ per molecule. Numbers of Ni and Co associated with the His-loop were approximately one ion per molecule and the thermodynamic parameters of the association with these ions were different from that of Zn2+.

One of the most interesting aspects of these enzymes is the ability of some members to selectively recognize specific linkage types between ubiquitin in polyubiquitin chains and their endo and exo specificity. The structural basis of exo-specific deubiquitination catalyzed by a DUB is poorly understood. UCH37, a cysteine DUB conserved from fungi to humans, is a proteasome-associated factor that regulates the proteasome by sequentially cleaving polyubiquitin chains from their distal ends, i.e., by exo-specific deubiquitination. In addition to the catalytic domain, the DUB features a functionally uncharacterized UCH37-like domain (ULD), presumed to keep the enzyme in an inhibited state in its proteasome-free form. Herein we report the crystal structure of two constructs of UCH37 from Trichinella spiralis in complex with a ubiquitin-based suicide inhibitor, ubiquitin vinyl methyl ester (UbVME). These structures show that the ULD makes direct contact with ubiquitin stabilizing a highly unusual intra-molecular salt bridge between Lys48 and Glu51 of ubiquitin, an interaction that would be favored only with the distal ubiquitin but not with the internal ones in a Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chain. An inspection of 39 DUB-ubiquitin structures in the protein data bank reveals the uniqueness of the salt bridge in ubiquitin bound to UCH37, an interaction that disappears when the ULD is deleted, as revealed in the structure of the catalytic domain alone bound to UbVME. The structural data are consistent with previously reported mutational data on the mammalian enzyme, which, together with the fact that the ULD residues that bind to ubiquitin are conserved, points to a similar mechanism behind the exo specificity of the human enzyme. To the best of our knowledge, these data provide the only structural example so far of how the exo specificity of a DUB can be determined by its non-catalytic domain. Thus, our data show that, contrary to its proposed inhibitory role, the ULD actually contributes to substrate recognition and could be a major determinant of proteasome-associated function of UCH37. Moreover, our structures show that the unproductively oriented catalytic cysteine in the free enzyme is aligned correctly when ubiquitin binds, suggesting a mechanism for ubiquitin selectivity.",

GMP being a biologically active component has gained much attention in the past decade. It also has unique chemical and functional properties. Many of the biological properties have been ascribed to the carbohydrate moieties attached to the peptide. The unique set of amino acids in GMP makes it a sought-after ingredient with nutraceutical properties. Besides its biological activity, GMP has several interesting techno-functional properties such as wide pH range solubility, emulsifying properties as well as foaming abilities which are shown to be promising for applications in food and nutrition industry. These properties of GMP have given new dimension for the profitable utilization of cheese whey to the dairy industry. A number of protocols for isolation of GMP from cheese whey have been reported. Moreover, its role in detection of sweet/rennet whey adulteration in milk and milk products has also attracted attention of various researchers, and many GMP-specific analytical methods have been proposed. This review discusses the chemico-functional properties of GMP and its role in the detection methods for checking cheese or sweet whey adulteration in milk.

Using two-photon fluorescence polarimetry in giant unilamellar vesicles and in the plasma membrane (PM) of living intact and actin-disrupted cells, we show that the BODIPY-groups in B-Chol and B-P-Chol are oriented perpendicular and almost parallel to the bilayer normal, respectively. B-Chol is in all three membrane systems much stronger oriented than B-P-Chol. Interestingly, we found that the lateral diffusion in the PM was two times slower for B-Chol than for B-P-Chol, although we found no difference in lateral diffusion in model membranes. Stimulated emission depletion microscopy, performed for the first time, to our knowledge, with fluorescent sterols, revealed that the difference in lateral diffusion of the BODIPY-cholesterol probes was not caused by anomalous subdiffusion, because diffusion of both analogs in the PM was free but not hindered. Our combined measurements show that the position and orientation of the BODIPY moiety in cholesterol analogs have a severe influence on lateral diffusion specifically in the PM of living cells.",

We show that Geminin preferentially forms stable coiled-coil heterodimers with its homologue, Idas. In contrast to Idas-Geminin heterodimers, Idas homodimers are thermodynamically unstable and are unlikely to exist as a stable macromolecule under physiological conditions. The crystal structure of the homology regions of Idas in complex with Geminin showed a tight head-to-head heterodimeric coiled-coil. This Idas-Geminin heterodimer binds Cdt1 less strongly than Geminin-Geminin, still with high affinity (∼30 nm), but with notably different thermodynamic properties. Consistently, in Xenopus egg extracts, Idas-Geminin is less active in licensing inhibition compared with a Geminin-Geminin homodimer. In human cultured cells, ectopic expression of Idas leads to limited over-replication, which is counteracted by Geminin co-expression. The properties of the Idas-Geminin complex suggest it as the functional form of Idas and provide a possible mechanism to modulate Geminin activity.",DNA Replication;Isothermal Titration Calorimetry;Protein Stability;X-ray Crystallography;X-ray Scattering;Xenopus;Coiled Coil

This family was named pleC/divJ homolog sensor family (PdhS) as previously suggested (Hallez et al., 2004). In order to predict the kinases interacting with a response regulator, we took advantage of a previous analysis that defined the regions of the histidine kinase that make contact with the response regulator and that are responsible for the specificity of this interaction (Skerker et al., 2008). This approach was integrated with the hypothesis that all Alphaproteobacterial DivK and PleC proteins are able to interact with DivK (Brilli et al., 2010). The fragment of the HK responsible for the specific interaction with the response regulator DivK comprises helix 1 and helix 2 of the two-helix bundle that surrounds the histidine residue (Ohta and Newton, 2003; Skerker et al., 2008). Helix 1 of the C. crescentus DivJ corresponds to residues 332 to 351 and helix 2 corresponds to 369 to 395. Results of the alignment of DivJs and PleCs are shown in figure S2. From this alignment, in which we used both helices, we derived a probability model describing the variability at each position of the most conserved helix (helix 1) in DivJ and PleC proteins from organisms possessing DivK (Fig. 6A). We scanned for HKs in Alphaproteobacteria genomes using a probability matrix that allowed us to assign a score to each of them, while a threshold chosen to include known DivK partners allowed identifying additional putative DivK interactors. Notably, S. meliloti CbrA (Gibson et al., 2007) and the B. abortus PdhS (Hallez et al., 2007), which have been hypothesized to interact with DivK, were in fact detected with this bioinformatic analysis. The list of accession numbers of PdhS family members is shown in table S1. S. meliloti showed five PdhS kinases including CbrA (Gibson et al., 2006), DivJ and PleC (Fields et al., 2012) and two other histidine kinases putatively belonging to the PdhS family that we named PdhSA and PdhSB (Fig. 6B), SMc04212 and SMc01128 respectively.",

IAPP is responsible for amyloid formation during type-2 diabetes. The polypeptide is 37 residues in length and contains three aromatic residues Phe-15, Phe-23, and Tyr-37. The ability of all single aromatic to leucine mutants, all double aromatic to leucine mutants and the triple leucine mutant to form amyloid were examined. Amyloid formation was almost twice as rapid for the F15L mutant relative to wild-type, but was almost three fold slower for the Y37L mutant and almost two fold slower for F23L mutant. Amyloid fibrils formed from each of the single mutants were effective at seeding amyloid formation by wild-type IAPP, implying that the fibril structures are similar. The F15LF23L double mutant has a larger effect than the F15LY37L double mutant on the rate of amyloid formation, even though a Y37L substitution has more drastic consequences in the wild-type background than does the F23L mutation, suggesting non-additive effects between the different sites. The triple leucine mutant and the F23LY37L double mutant are the slowest to form amyloid. F15 has been proposed to make important contacts early in the aggregation pathway, but the F15L mutant data indicates that they are not optimal. A set of variants containing natural and unnatural amino acids at position 15, which were designed to conserve hydrophobicity, but which alter α-helix and β-sheet propensity, were analyzed to determine the properties of this position that control the rate of amyloid formation. There is no correlation between β-sheet propensity at this position and the rate of amyloid formation, but there is a correlation with α-helical propensity.",IAPP;Islet amyloid polypeptide;Amylin;Amyloid;Aromatic interactions;Pi-interactions

In order to establish the sequence of molecular rearrangements and side chain protonation accompanying the formation of the membrane-competent state of the toxin’s translocation (T) domain, we have developed and applied an integrated approach that combines multiple techniques of computational chemistry (e.g., long, µsec-range, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations; continuum electrostatics calculations; and thermodynamic integration) with several experimental techniques of fluorescence spectroscopy. Thermodynamic integration calculations indicate that protonation of H257 causes the greatest destabilization of the native structure (6.9 kcal/mole), which is consistent with our early mutagenesis results. Extensive equilibrium MD simulations with a combined length of over eight µsec demonstrate that histidine protonation, while not accompanied by the loss of structural compactness of the T-domain, nevertheless results in substantial molecular rearrangements characterized by the partial loss of secondary structure due to unfolding of helices TH1 and TH2, and the loss of close contact between the C- and N-terminal segments. The structural changes accompanying the formation of the membrane-competent state ensure an easier exposure of the internal hydrophobic hairpin formed by helices TH8 and TH9, in preparation for its subsequent transmembrane insertion.",acid-induced conformational change;membrane protein insertion;histidine protonation;molecular dynamics;fluorescence;conformational switch

Nevertheless, how RPA coordinates biochemical functions of its eight domains remains unknown. We examined the structural biochemistry of RPA’s DNA-binding activity, combining small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the architecture of RPA’s DNA-binding core. The scattering data reveal compaction promoted by DNA binding; DNA-free RPA exists in an ensemble of states with inter-domain mobility and becomes progressively more condensed and less dynamic on binding ssDNA. Our results contrast with previous models proposing RPA initially binds ssDNA in a condensed state and becomes more extended as it fully engages the substrate. Moreover, the consensus view that RPA engages ssDNA in initial, intermediate and final stages conflicts with our data revealing that RPA undergoes two (not three) transitions as it binds ssDNA with no evidence for a discrete intermediate state. These results form a framework for understanding how RPA integrates the ssDNA substrate into DNA processing machinery, provides substrate access to its binding partners and promotes the progression and selection of DNA processing pathways.",

Similarly, 11β-HSD1 is elevated in the ageing brain where it exacerbates glucocorticoid-associated cognitive decline. Deficiency or selective inhibition of 11β-HSD1 improves multiple metabolic syndrome parameters in rodent models and human clinical trials and similarly improves cognitive function with ageing. The efficacy of inhibitors in human therapy remains unclear. 11β-HSD2 is a high-affinity dehydrogenase that inactivates glucocorticoids. In the distal nephron, 11β-HSD2 ensures that only aldosterone is an agonist at mineralocorticoid receptors (MR). 11β-HSD2 inhibition or genetic deficiency causes apparent mineralocorticoid excess and hypertension due to inappropriate glucocorticoid activation of renal MR. The placenta and fetus also highly express 11β-HSD2 which, by inactivating glucocorticoids, prevents premature maturation of fetal tissues and consequent developmental “programming.” The role of 11β-HSD2 as a marker of programming is being explored. The 11β-HSDs thus illuminate the emerging biology of intracrine control, afford important insights into human pathogenesis, and offer new tissue-restricted therapeutic avenues.",

Here, we report biochemical and structural characterization of the C-terminal three FF domains (FF4–6) of TCERG1, revealing a rigid integral domain structure of the tandem FF repeat that interacts with the hyperphosphorylated CTD (PCTD). Although FF4 and FF5 adopt a classical FF domain fold containing three orthogonally packed α helices and a 310 helix, FF6 contains an additional insertion helix between α1 and α2. The formation of the integral tandem FF4–6 repeat is achieved by merging the last helix of the preceding FF domain and the first helix of the following FF domain and by direct interactions between neighboring FF domains. Using peptide column binding assays and NMR titrations, we show that binding of the FF4–6 tandem repeat to the PCTD requires simultaneous phosphorylation at Ser2, Ser5, and Ser7 positions within two consecutive Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7 heptad repeats. Such a sequence-specific PCTD recognition is achieved through CTD-docking sites on FF4 and FF5 of TCERG1 but not FF6. Our study presents the first example of a nuclear factor requiring all three phospho-Ser marks within the heptad repeat of the CTD for high affinity binding and provides a molecular interpretation for the biochemical connection between the Ser7 phosphorylation enrichment in the CTD of the transcribing RNA polymerase II over introns and co-transcriptional splicing events.",Protein Structure;RNA Polymerase II;Structural Biology;Transcription;Transcription Elongation Factors;RNAPII CTD

A rigorous assessment of the most readily accessed conformations in solution is required to explain the onset of substrate recognition and collagenolysis. The present study utilized paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) to calculate the maximum occurrence (MO) of MMP-1 conformations. The MMP-1 conformations with large MO values (up to 47%) are restricted into a relatively small conformational region. All conformations with high MO values differ largely from the closed MMP-1 structures obtained by x-ray crystallography. The MO of the latter is ∼20%, which represents the upper limit for the presence of this conformation in the ensemble sampled by the protein in solution. In all the high MO conformations, the CAT and HPX domains are not in tight contact, and the residues of the HPX domain reported to be responsible for the binding to the collagen triple-helix are solvent exposed. Thus, overall analysis of the highest MO conformations indicated that MMP-1 in solution was poised to interact with collagen and then could readily proceed along the steps of collagenolysis.",Chemical Biology;Collagen;Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP);Metalloprotease;Structural Biology;Collagenolysis;Maximum Occurrence

The interaction of the virus with the insect host innate immune system plays a critical role in the outcome of infection. The major mechanism of antiviral defense is the siRNA pathway that responds through the detection of virus-derived dsRNA to suppress virus replication. However, other innate antimicrobial pathways such as Imd, Toll, Jak-STAT, and the autophagy pathway have also been shown to play important roles in antiviral immunity.

Essential for ataxin-1 aggregation is the anomalous expansion of a polyglutamine tract near the protein N-terminus, but the sequence-wise distant AXH domain modulates and contributes to the process. The AXH domain is also involved in the nonpathologic functions of the protein, including a variety of intermolecular interactions with other cellular partners. The domain forms a globular dimer in solution and displays a dimer of dimers arrangement in the crystal asymmetric unit. Here, we have characterized the domain further by studying its behavior in the crystal and in solution. We solved two new structures of the domain crystallized under different conditions that confirm an inherent plasticity of the AXH fold. In solution, the domain is present as a complex equilibrium mixture of monomeric, dimeric, and higher molecular weight species. This behavior, together with the tendency of the AXH fold to be trapped in local conformations, and the multiplicity of protomer interfaces, makes the AXH domain an unusual example of a chameleon protein whose properties bear potential relevance for the aggregation properties of ataxin-1 and thus for disease.",

Several cells and various tissues coordinate together to generate an organ level response which further regulates the ultimate physiological state.

Adhesion of monocytes to the vessel wall and their transendothelial migration are critical in atherogenesis and many other inflammatory diseases. Chemokines carefully control all steps of the monocyte recruitment process. Those chemokines specialized in controlling arrest are typically immobilized on the endothelial surface, mediating the arrest of rolling monocytes by chemokine receptor-triggered pathways. The chemokine receptor CXCR2 functions as an important arrest receptor on monocytes. An arrest function has been revealed for the bona fide CXCR2 ligands CXCL1 and CXCL8, but genetic studies also suggested that additional arrest chemokines are likely to be involved in atherogenic leukocyte recruitment. While CXCR2 is known to interact with numerous CXC chemokine ligands, the CLF chemokine MIF, which structurally does not belong to the CXC chemokine sub-family, was surprisingly identified as a non-cognate ligand of CXCR2, responsible for critical arrest functions during the atherogenic process. MIF was originally identified as macrophage migration inhibitory factor (this function being eponymous), but is now known as a potent inflammatory cytokine with CLFs including chemotaxis and leukocyte arrest. This review will cover the mechanisms underlying these functions, including MIF’s effects on LFA1 integrin activity and signal transduction, and will discuss the structural similarities between MIF and the bona fide CXCR2 ligand CXCL8 while emphasizing the structural differences. As MIF also interacts with CXCR4, a chemokine receptor implicated in CXCL12-elicited lymphocyte arrest, the arrest potential of the MIF/CXCR4 axis will also be scrutinized as well as the recently identified role of pericyte MIF in attracting leukocytes exiting through venules as part of the pericyte “motility instruction program.”",chemokine;leukocyte recruitment;arrest;signal transduction;atherosclerosis;inflammation

While defects within the neural epigenome have traditionally been studied in the context of early developmental and heritable cognitive disorders, recent studies point to aberrant histone acetylation status as a key mechanism underlying acquired inappropriate alterations of genome structure and function in post-mitotic neurons during the aging process. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly evident that chromatin acetylation status can be impaired during the lifetime of neurons through mechanisms related to loss of function of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. Several HATs have been shown to participate in vital neuronal functions such as regulation of neuronal plasticity and memory formation. As such, dysregulation of such HATs has been implicated in the pathogenesis associated with age-associated neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive decline. In order to counteract the loss of HAT function in neurodegenerative diseases, the current therapeutic strategies involve the use of small molecules called histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors that antagonize HDAC activity and thus enhance acetylation levels. Although this strategy has displayed promising therapeutic effects, currently used HDAC inhibitors lack target specificity, raising concerns about their applicability. With rapidly evolving literature on HATs and their respective functions in mediating neuronal survival and higher order brain function such as learning and memory, modulating the function of specific HATs holds new promises as a therapeutic tool in neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we focus on the recent progress in research regarding epigenetic histone acetylation mechanisms underlying neuronal activity and cognitive function. We discuss the current understanding of specific HDACs and HATs in neurodegenerative diseases and the future promising prospects of using specific HAT based therapeutic approaches.",epigenetics;histone acetyltransferases (HATs);histone deacetylases (HDACs);neurodegenerative diseases;histone code;learning and memory;cell death;synaptic plasticity

Humans express two types of defensins, α- and β-defensins, which have antiviral activity against both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. The diversity of defensin-sensitive viral species reflects a multitude of antiviral mechanisms. These include direct defensin targeting of viral envelopes, glycoproteins, and capsids in addition to inhibition of viral fusion and post-entry neutralization. Binding and modulation of host cell surface receptors and disruption of intracellular signaling by defensins can also inhibit viral replication. In addition, defensins can function as chemokines to augment and alter adaptive immune responses, revealing an indirect antiviral mechanism. Nonetheless, many questions regarding the antiviral activities of defensins remain. Although significant mechanistic data are known for α-defensins, molecular details for β-defensin inhibition are mostly lacking.

Here we report the identification of several inhibitors of SrtA using virtual screening methods that employ the relaxed complex scheme, an advanced computer-docking methodology that accounts for protein receptor flexibility. Experimental testing validates that several compounds identified in the screen inhibit the activity of SrtA.

Here we explore the response of various biophysical parameters to the introduction of β-hairpin motifs within polyQ sequences. These motifs (trpzip, disulfide, D-Pro-Gly, Coulombic attraction, L-Pro-Gly) enhance formation rates and stabilities of amyloid fibrils with degrees of effectiveness well-correlated with their known abilities to enhance β-hairpin formation in other peptides. These changes led to decreases in the critical nucleus for amyloid formation from a value of n* = 4 for a simple, unbroken Q23 sequence to approximate unitary n* values for similar length polyQs containing β-hairpin motifs. At the same time, the morphologies, secondary structures, and bioactivities of the resulting fibrils were essentially unchanged from simple polyQ aggregates. In particular, the signature pattern of SSNMR 13C Gln resonances that appears to be unique to polyQ amyloid is replicated exactly in fibrils from a β-hairpin polyQ. Importantly, while β-hairpin motifs do produce enhancements in the equilibrium constant for nucleation in aggregation reactions, these Kn* values remain quite low (~ 10−10) and there is no evidence for significant embellishment of β-structure within the monomer ensemble. The results indicate an important role for β-turns in the nucleation mechanism and structure of polyQ amyloid and have implications for the nature of the toxic species in expanded CAG repeat diseases.",

Butler, ua.ude.edialeda@reltub.asil","The development of lethal, castration resistant prostate cancer is associated with adaptive changes to the androgen receptor (AR), including the emergence of mutant receptors and truncated, constitutively active AR variants. AR relies on the molecular chaperone HSP90 for its function in both normal and malignant prostate cells, but the requirement for HSP90 in environments with aberrant AR expression is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the efficacy of three HSP90 inhibitors, 17-AAG, HSP990 and AUY922, against clinically-relevant AR missense mutants and truncated variants. HSP90 inhibition effectively suppressed the signaling of wild-type AR and all AR missense mutants tested. By contrast, two truncated AR variants, AR-V7 and ARv567es, exhibited marked resistance to HSP90 inhibitors. Supporting this observation, nuclear localization of the truncated AR variants was not affected by HSP90 inhibition and AR variant:HSP90 complexes could not be detected in prostate cancer cells. Interestingly, HSP90 inhibition resulted in accumulation of AR-V7 and ARv567es in both cell lines and human tumor explants. Despite the apparent independence of AR variants from HSP90 and their treatment-associated induction, the growth of cell lines with endogenous or enforced expression of AR-V7 or ARv567es remained highly sensitive to AUY922. This study demonstrates that functional AR variant signaling does not confer resistance to HSP90 inhibition, yields insight into the interaction between AR and HSP90 and provides further impetus for the clinical application of HSP90 inhibitors in advanced prostate cancer.",Androgen receptor;variant;HSP90;HSP90 inhibitor;prostate cancer

ICP27 binds viral mRNAs and interacts with TAP/NXF, providing a link to the cellular mRNA export pathway. ICP27 also interacts with the mRNA export adaptor protein Aly/REF, which binds cellular mRNAs and also interacts with TAP/NXF. Studies using small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown indicated that Aly/REF is not required for cellular mRNA export, and similar knockdown studies during HSV-1 infection led us to conclude that Aly/REF may be dispensable for viral RNA export. Recently, the structural basis of the interaction of ICP27 with Aly/REF was elucidated at atomic resolution, and it was shown that three ICP27 residues, W105, R107, and L108, interface with the RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain of Aly/REF. Here, to determine the role the interaction of ICP27 and Aly/REF plays during infection, these residues were mutated to alanine, and a recombinant virus, WRL-A, was constructed. Virus production was reduced about 10-fold during WRL-A infection, and export of ICP27 protein and most viral mRNAs was less efficient. We conclude that interaction of ICP27 with Aly/REF contributes to efficient viral mRNA export.",

One function of the nuclear lamina is to organize heterochromatin at the inner nuclear periphery. However, very little is known about how heterochromatin attaches to the nuclear lamina and how such attachments are restored at mitotic exit. Here we show that a previously unstudied human protein, PRR14, functions to tether heterochromatin to the nuclear periphery during interphase, through associations with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and the nuclear lamina. During early mitosis, PRR14 is released from the nuclear lamina and chromatin, and remains soluble. Strikingly, at the onset of anaphase, PRR14 is incorporated rapidly into chromatin through HP1 binding. Finally, in telophase, PRR14 relocalizes to the reforming nuclear lamina. This stepwise reassembly of PRR14 suggests a novel function in the selection of HP1–bound heterochromatin for reattachment to the nuclear lamina as cells exit mitosis.",

The SWI5-SFR1 complex stabilizes the presynaptic filament and enhances its ability to mediate the homologous DNA pairing reaction. Here we characterize the RAD51 presynaptic filament stabilization function of the SWI5-SFR1 complex using optical tweezers. Biochemical experiments reveal that SWI5-SFR1 enhances ATP hydrolysis by single-stranded DNA-bound RAD51.

Large conformational changes are observed when the ligand-free protein is bound to WAMP. Multiple residues, completely surrounding the active site pocket, collapsed onto WAMP. Comparison of the structures to those of human cytosolic TrpRS (Hs-cTrpRS) provides information about the possibility of targeting Pf-cTrpRS for inhibitor development. There is a high degree of similarity between Pf-cTrpRS and Hs-cTrpRS within the active site. However, the large motion that Pf-cTrpRS undergoes during transitions between different functional states avails an opportunity to arrive at compounds which selectively perturb the motion, and may provide a starting point for the development of new anti-malaria therapeutics.",Plasmodium falciparum;malaria;tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase;crystal structure;conformational changes;drug design

To date, the C-terminus of TDP-43, which is aggregation-prone and contains almost all ALS-associated mutations, has garnered much attention while the functions of the N-terminus of TDP-43 remain largely unknown. To bridge this gap in our knowledge, we utilized novel cell culture and computer-assisted models to evaluate which region(s) of TDP-43 regulate its folding, self-interaction, biological activity and aggregation. We determined that the extreme N-terminus of TDP-43, specifically the first 10 residues, regulates folding of TDP-43 monomers necessary for proper homodimerization and TDP-43-regulated splicing. Despite such beneficial functions, we discovered an interesting dichotomy: full-length TDP-43 aggregation, which is believed to be a pathogenic process, also requires the extreme N-terminus of TDP-43. As such, we provide new insight into the structural basis for TDP-43 function and aggregation, and we suggest that stabilization of TDP-43 homodimers, the physiologically active form of TDP-43, may be a promising therapeutic strategy for ALS and FTLD-TDP.",

This protein belongs to the GNAT GCN5 family and shows proapoptotic activity in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Patt1 is an attractive therapeutic target. The sequence analysis, fold recognition predictions and homology modeling of Patt1 protein structure were performed. N- and C- termini of Patt1 were unstructured. Central part revealed classical GNAT fold–central 7-stranded beta sheet core surrounded by intervening 4 alpha helices. The model was assessed with the methods for protein structure validation PROQ and MetaMQAPII. The all-atom 12 ns molecular dynamics simulation of Patt1 model with TIP3P water model and counterions was conducted. All assessment methods implemented resulted in conviction that the model was of quality that could provide confident structural information to infer sequence-structure-function relationships of Patt1. Phe186 and Cys137 were identified as residues engaged in acetyltransfer reaction and the clues for the identification of reaction mechanism were proposed. The knowledge of detailed molecular architecture of Patt1 is not only the key to understanding its mechanistic functional properties but it also opens the possibility of rational drug and protein design experiments, leading to development of effective therapeutic methods.",GNAT family proteins;HAT histone acetyltransferases;Homology modeling;Molecular dynamics simulation;Protein structure prediction

Although Pacman has been well studied in Drosophila tissue culture cells, the biologically relevant cellular pathways controlled by Pacman in natural tissues are unknown. This study shows that a hypomorphic mutation in pacman (pcm5) results in smaller wing imaginal discs. These tissues, found in the larva, are known to grow and differentiate to form wing and thorax structures in the adult fly. Using microarray analysis, followed by quantitative RT-PCR, we show that eight mRNAs were increased in level by > 2-fold in the pcm5 mutant wing discs compared with the control. The levels of pre-mRNAs were tested for five of these mRNAs; four did not increase in the pcm5 mutant, showing that they are regulated at the post-transcriptional level and, therefore, could be directly affected by Pacman. These transcripts include one that encodes the heat shock protein Hsp67Bc, which is upregulated 11.9-fold at the post-transcriptional level and 2.3-fold at the protein level. One miRNA, miR-277-3p, is 5.6-fold downregulated at the post-transcriptional level in mutant discs, suggesting that Pacman affects its processing in this tissue. Together, these data show that a relatively small number of mRNAs and miRNAs substantially change in abundance in pacman mutant wing imaginal discs.

(iii) Longitudinal density waves flux back and forth along the nucleoid, with 5–10% of density shifting within 5s, enhancing internal nucleoid mobility. Furthermore, sisters separate end-to-end in sequential discontinuous pulses, each elongating the nucleoid by 5–15%. Pulses occur at 20min intervals, at defined cell cycle times. This progression is mediated by sequential installation and release of programmed tethers, implying cyclic accumulation and relief of intra-nucleoid mechanical stress.

To identify the mechanism underlying the differences in substrate specificity among the subclass B3 MBLs, we determined the structure of SMB-1, using 1.6-Å diffraction data. Consequently, we found that SMB-1 reserves a space in the active site to accommodate β-lactam, even with a bulky R1 side chain, due to a loss of amino acid residues corresponding to F31 and L226 of BJP-1, which protrude into the active site to prevent β-lactam from binding. The protein also possesses a unique amino acid residue, Q157, which probably plays a role in recognition of β-lactams via the hydrogen bond interaction, which is missing in BJP-1 and FEZ-1, whose Km values for β-lactams are particularly high. In addition, we determined the mercaptoacetate (MCR)-complexed SMB-1 structure and revealed the mode of its inhibition by MCR: the thiolate group bridges to two zinc ions (Zn1 and Zn2). One of the carboxylate oxygen atoms of MCR makes contact with Zn2 and Ser221, and the other makes contact with T223 and a water molecule. Our results demonstrate the possibility that MCR could be a potent inhibitor for subclass B3 MBLs and that the screening technique using MCR as an inhibitor would be effective for detecting subclass B3 MBL producers.",

Areduction in E2F binding affinity occurs with S788/S795 phosphorylation that is additive with the effects of phosphorylation at other sites, and we propose a structural mechanism that explains this additivity.

","The microtubule-associated protein (MAP) tau has been implicated in the pathology of numerous neurodegenerative diseases. In the past decade, the hyperphosphorylated and aggregated states of tau protein have been important targets in the drug discovery field for the potential treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Although several compounds have been reported to reduce the hyperphosphorylated state of tau or impact the stabilization of tau, their therapeutic activities are still to be validated. Recently, reduction of total cellular tau protein has emerged as an alternate intervention point for drug development and a potential treatment of tauopathies. We have developed and optimized a homogenous assay, using the AlphaLISA and HTRF assay technologies, for the quantification of total cellular tau protein levels in the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line. The signal-to-basal ratios were 375 and 5.3, and the Z’ factors were 0.67 and 0.60 for the AlphaLISA and HTRF tau assays, respectively. The clear advantages of this homogeneous tau assay over conventional total tau assays, such as ELISA and Western blot, are the elimination of plate wash steps and miniaturization of the assay into 1536-well plate format for the ultra–high-throughput screening of large compound libraries.",Alzheimer’s disease;FRET-based assay;high throughput screening assay;prions;neurodegenerative diseases;Tau protein

However, the spatial and functional relationships between these two transport pathways, which represent critical information for unraveling the fundamental nucleocytoplasmic transport mechanism, remain in dispute. The direct experimental examination of passive and facilitated transport with a high spatiotemporal resolution under real-time trafficking conditions in native NPCs is still difficult. To address this issue and further define these transport mechanisms, we recently developed single-point edge-excitation sub-diffraction (SPEED) microscopy and a deconvolution algorithm to directly map both passive and facilitated transport routes in three dimensions (3D) in native NPCs. Our findings revealed that passive and facilitated transport occur through spatially distinct transport routes. Signal-independent small molecules exhibit a high probability of passively diffusing through an axial central viscous channel, while transport receptors and their cargo complexes preferentially travel through the periphery, around this central channel, after interacting with phenylalanine-glycine (FG) filaments. Strikingly, these two distinct transport zones are not completely separate either spatially or functionally. Instead, their conformations are closely correlated and simultaneously regulated. In this review, we will specifically highlight a detailed procedure for 3D mapping of passive and facilitated transport routes, demonstrate the correlation between these two distinct pathways, and finally, speculate regarding the regulation of the transport pathways driven by the conformational changes of FG filaments in NPCs.",nucleocytoplasmic transport;deconvolution;single-particle tracking;three-dimensional;probability density map;super-resolution microscopy;single-molecule fluorescence

We report that Wnt signaling is governed by phosphorylation regulation of Axin scaffolding function. Phosphorylation by GSK3 kept Axin activated (“open”) for β-catenin interaction and poised for engagement of LRP6. Formation of the Wnt-induced LRP6-Axin signaling complex promoted Axin dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase-1, and inactivated (“closed”) Axin through an intra-molecular interaction.

First, we perform a one-to-one mapping between paradigmatic behaviors in chemical kinetics (i.e., non-cooperative, cooperative, ultra-sensitive, anti-cooperative) and in mean-field statistical mechanics (i.e., paramagnetic, high and low temperature ferromagnetic, anti-ferromagnetic). Interestingly, the statistical mechanics approach allows a unified, broad theory for all scenarios and, in particular, Michaelis-Menten, Hill and Adair equations are consistently recovered. This framework is then tested against experimental biological data with an overall excellent agreement. One step forward, we consistently read the whole mapping from a cybernetic perspective, highlighting deep structural analogies between the above-mentioned kinetics and fundamental bricks in electronics (i.e. operational amplifiers, flashes, flip-flops), so to build a clear bridge linking biochemical kinetics and cybernetics.",

Results, consistent with the dental phenotype in humans with type IV OI, showed decreased molar volume and reduced mineralized tissue volume in the teeth without changes in enamel properties. Increased acid phosphate content was noted at 2 and 6 months by FTIRI, and a trend towards altered collagen structure was noted at 2 but not 6 months in the Brtl/+ teeth. The increase in acid phosphate content suggests a delay in the mineralization process, most likely associated with the defect in the collagen structure. It appears that in the Brtl/+ teeth slow maturation of the mineralized structures allows correction of altered mineral content and acid phosphate distribution.",

The murine LL-37 ortholog, mCRAMP, also inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced responses, but unlike LL-37, it inhibited viral-induced responses in mouse cells. A fluorescence polarization assay showed that LL-37 was able to bind dsRNA better than mCRAMP. In the human lung epithelial cell line BEAS-2B, LL-37, but not mCRAMP, colocalized with TLR3, and the colocalization was increased in the presence of dsRNA. The presence of poly(I:C) increased the accumulation of LL-37 in Rab5 endosomes. Signaling by cells induced with both LL-37 and poly(I:C) was sensitive to inhibitors that affect clathrin-independent trafficking, whereas signaling by poly(I:C) alone was not, suggesting that the LL-37-poly(I:C) complex trafficked to signaling endosomes by a different mechanism than poly(I:C) alone. siRNA knockdown of known LL-37 receptors identified that FPRL1 was responsible for TLR3 signaling induced by LL-37-poly(I:C). These results show that LL-37 and mCRAMP have different activities in TLR3 signaling and that LL-37 can redirect trafficking of poly(I:C) to effect signaling by TLR3 in early endosomes in a mechanism that involves FPRL1.",Endosomes;Innate Immunity;Peptides;Signal Transduction;Toll-like Receptors (TLR);Cathelicidin LL-37;Formyl Peptide Receptor-like 1

Short palate lung and nasal epithelial clone 1 (SPLUNC1) is a secreted, innate defense protein and an autocrine inhibitor of ENaC that is highly expressed in airway epithelia. While SPLUNC1 has a bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI)-type structure, its NH2-terminal region lacks structure. Here we found that an 18 amino acid peptide, S18, which corresponded to residues G22-A39 of the SPLUNC1 NH2 terminus inhibited ENaC activity to a similar degree as full-length SPLUNC1 (∼2.5 fold), while SPLUNC1 protein lacking this region was without effect. S18 did not inhibit the structurally related acid-sensing ion channels, indicating specificity for ENaC. However, S18 preferentially bound to the βENaC subunit in a glycosylation-dependent manner. ENaC hyperactivity is contributory to cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Unlike control, CF human bronchial epithelial cultures (HBECs) where airway surface liquid (ASL) height was abnormally low (4.2 ± 0.6 μm), addition of S18 prevented ENaC-led ASL hyperabsorption and maintained CF ASL height at 7.9 ± 0.6 μm, even in the presence of neutrophil elastase, which is comparable to heights seen in normal HBECs. Our data also indicate that the ENaC inhibitory domain of SPLUNC1 may be cleaved away from the main molecule by neutrophil elastase, suggesting that it may still be active during inflammation or neutrophilia. Furthermore, the robust inhibition of ENaC by the S18 peptide suggests that this peptide may be suitable for treating CF lung disease.",neutrophil elastase;SPLUNC;COPD;BPIFA1;glycosylation

Here we employ single-molecule fluorescence microscopy with an unprecedented spatiotemporal accuracy of 8 nm and 2 ms to provide new insights into the mechanism of nuclear mRNP export in live human cells. We find that mRNPs exiting the nucleus are decelerated and selected at the centre of the NPC, and adopt a fast-slow-fast diffusion pattern during their brief, ~12 ms interaction with the NPC. A 3D reconstruction of the export route indicates that mRNPs primarily interact with the periphery on the nucleoplasmic side and in the center of the NPC, without entering the central axial conduit utilized for passive diffusion of small molecules, and eventually dissociate on the cytoplasmic side.",

HIV polyadenylation involves active repression of a promoter-proximal polyadenylation signal, auxiliary upstream regulatory elements and moonlighting polyadenylation factors that have additional impacts on HIV biology outside of the constraints of classical mRNA 3’ end formation.

In bacteria, SelA synthesizes Sec from Ser-tRNASec, whereas in archaea and eukaryotes SepSecS forms Sec from phosphoserine (Sep) acylated to tRNASec. We determined the crystal structures of Aquifex aeolicus SelA complexes, which revealed a ring-shaped homodecamer that binds 10 tRNASec molecules, each interacting with four SelA subunits. The SelA N-terminal domain binds the tRNASec-specific D-arm structure, thereby discriminating Ser-tRNASec from Ser-tRNASer. A large cleft is created between two subunits and accommodates the 3′-terminal region of Ser-tRNASec. The SelA structures together with in vivo and in vitro enzyme assays show decamerization to be essential for SelA function. SelA catalyzes pyridoxal 5′-phosphate–dependent Sec formation involving Arg residues nonhomologous to those in SepSecS. Different protein architecture and substrate coordination of the bacterial enzyme provide structural evidence for independent evolution of the two Sec synthesis systems present in nature.",

When combined in a second step with counterselection using a small molecule toxin, seamless products can be obtained. Here, we report the advantages of a genetic strategy using CcdB as the counterselectable agent. Expression of CcdB is toxic to E. coli in the absence of the CcdA antidote so counterselection is initiated by the removal of CcdA expression. CcdB counterselection is robust and does not require titrations or experiment-to-experiment optimization. Because counterselection strategies necessarily differ according to the copy number of the target, we describe two variations. For multi-copy targets, we use two E. coli hosts so that counterselection is exerted by the transformation step that is needed to separate the recombined and unrecombined plasmids. For single copy targets, we put the ccdA gene onto the temperature-sensitive pSC101 Red expression plasmid so that counterselection is exerted by the standard temperature shift to remove the expression plasmid. To reduce unwanted intramolecular recombination, we also combined CcdB counterselection with Redα omission. These options improve the use of counterselection in recombineering with BACs, plasmids and the E. coli chromosome.",

Compared with the family Iridoviridae, to which the genus Ranavirus belongs, ranaviruses have a wide host range in that species/strains are known to infect fish, amphibians and reptiles, presumably due to recent host-switching events. We used eight sequenced ranavirus genomes and two selection-detection methods (site based and branch based) to identify genes that exhibited signatures of positive selection, potentially due to the selective pressures at play during host switching. We found evidence of positive selection acting on four genes via the site-based method, three of which were newly acquired genes unique to ranavirus genomes. Using the branch-based method, we identified eight additional candidate genes that exhibited signatures of dN/dS (non-synonymous/synonymous substitution rate) >1 in the clade where intense host switching had occurred. We found that these branch-specific patterns of elevated dN/dS were enriched in a small group of viral genes that have been acquired most recently in the ranavirus genome, compared with core genes that are shared among all members of the family Iridoviridae. Our results suggest that the group of newly acquired genes in the ranavirus genome may have undergone recent adaptive changes that have facilitated interspecies and interclass host switching.",

The Ca2+ sensitivity of KCa3.1 is conferred by the Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin (CaM), with the CaM C-lobe constitutively bound to an intracellular domain of the channel C terminus. It was proposed on the basis of the crystal structure obtained for the C-terminal region of the rat KCa2.2 channel (rSK2) with CaM that the binding of Ca2+ to the CaM N-lobe results in CaM interlocking the C-terminal regions of two adjacent KCa3.1 subunits, leading to the formation of a dimeric structure. A study was thus undertaken to identify residues of the CaM N-lobe–KCa3.1 complex that either contribute to the channel activation process or control the channel open probability at saturating Ca2+ (Pomax). A structural homology model of the KCa3.1–CaM complex was first generated using as template the crystal structure of the C-terminal region of the rat KCa2.2 channel with CaM. This model was confirmed by cross-bridging residues R362 of KCa3.1 and K75 of CaM. Patch-clamp experiments were next performed, demonstrating that the solvation energy of the residue at position 367 in KCa3.1 is a key determinant to the channel Pomax and deactivation time toff. Mutations of residues M368 and Q364 predicted to form anchoring points for CaM binding to KCa3.1 had little impact on either toff or Pomax.

We conclude that electrostatic interactions involving residues R362 and E363 and hydrophobic effects at M368 play a prominent role in KCa3.1 activation, whereas hydrophobic interactions at S367 are determinant to the stability of the CaM–KCa3.1 complex throughout gating.",

Polymeric micelles (PMs) can overcome some limitations of the oral delivery acting as carriers able to enhance drug absorption, by providing (1) protection of the loaded drug from the harsh environment of the GI tract, (2) release of the drug in a controlled manner at target sites, (3) prolongation of the residence time in the gut by mucoadhesion, and (4) inhibition of efflux pumps to improve the drug accumulation. To explain the mechanisms for enhancement of oral bioavailability, we discussed the special stability of PMs, the controlled release properties of pH-sensitive PMs, the prolongation of residence time with mucoadhesive PMs, and the P-gp inhibitors commonly used in PMs, respectively. The primary purpose of this paper is to illustrate the potential of PMs for delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs with bioavailability being well maintained.",

Phylogenetic analyses suggest that miRNA acquisition could play a role in phenotypic innovation. Moreover, miRNA-induced regulation strongly impacts genome evolution, increasing selective constraints on 3’UTRs, protein sequences and expression level divergence. Thus, it is essential to understand the factors governing sequence evolution for this important class of regulatory molecules. Investigation of the patterns of molecular evolution at miRNA loci have been limited in Caenorhabditis elegans because of the lack of a close outgroup. Instead, I used Caenorhabditis briggsae as the focus point of this study because of its close relationship to Caenorhabditis sp. 9. I also corroborated the patterns of sequence evolution in Caenorhabditis using published orthologous relationships among miRNAs in Drosophila. In nematodes and in flies, miRNA sequence divergence is not influenced by the genomic neighbourhood (i.e. intronic or intergenic) but is nevertheless affected by the genomic context because X-linked miRNAs evolve faster than autosomal miRNAs. However, this effect of chromosomal linkage can be explained by differential expression levels rather than a fast-X effect. The results presented here support a universal negative relationship between rates of molecular evolution and expression level, and suggest that mutations in highly expressed miRNAs are more likely to be deleterious because they potentially affect a larger number of target genes. Finally, I show that many single-family member miRNAs evolve faster than miRNAs from multigene families and have limited functional scope, suggesting that they are not strongly integrated in gene regulatory networks.",miRNA;expression level;molecular evolution;Caenorhabditis;Drosophila

Conformational selection posits the pre-existence of multiple conformations of the macromolecule from which the ligand selects the optimal one. Induced fit, on the other hand, postulates the existence of conformational rearrangements of the original conformation into an optimal one that is induced by binding of the ligand. In the former case, conformational transitions precede the binding event; in the latter, conformational changes follow the binding step. Kineticists have used a facile criterion to distinguish between the two mechanisms based on the dependence of the rate of relaxation to equilibrium, kobs, on the ligand concentration, [L]. A value of kobs decreasing hyperbolically with [L] is seen as diagnostic of conformational selection, while a value of kobs increasing hyperbolically with [L] is considered diagnostic of induced fit. However, this simple conclusion is only valid in the rather unrealistic assumption of conformational transitions being much slower than binding and dissociation events. In general, induced fit only produces values of kobs that increase with [L] but conformational selection is more versatile and is associated with values of kobs that increase, decrease with or are independent of [L]. The richer repertoire of kinetic properties of conformational selection applies to kinetic mechanisms with single or multiple saturable relaxations and explains the behavior of nearly all experimental systems reported in the literature thus far. Conformational selection is always sufficient and often necessary to account for the relaxation kinetics of ligand binding to a biological macromolecule and is therefore an essential component of any binding mechanism. On the other hand, induced fit is never necessary and only sufficient in a few cases. Therefore, the long assumed importance and preponderance of induced fit as a mechanism of ligand binding should be reconsidered.",

Great effort is being invested into deciphering specific neural interactions and circuits. At the same time, there exist few general theories or principles that explain brain function. We attribute this disparity, in part, to limitations in current methodologies. Traditional neurophysiological approaches record the activities of one neuron or a few neurons at a time. Neurochemical approaches focus on single neurotransmitters. Yet, there is an increasing realization that neural circuits operate at emergent levels, where the interactions between hundreds or thousands of neurons, utilizing multiple chemical transmitters, generate functional states. Brains function at the nanoscale, so tools to study brains must ultimately operate at this scale, as well. Nanoscience and nanotechnology are poised to provide a rich toolkit of novel methods to explore brain function by enabling simultaneous measurement and manipulation of activity of thousands or even millions of neurons. We and others refer to this goal as the Brain Activity Mapping Project.

Many severe forms of the disease, such as spondylocostal dystostosis, are recessive monogenic traits affecting somitogenesis, however the etiologies of the majority of CVM cases remain undetermined. Here we demonstrate that morphological defects of the notochord in zebrafish can generate congenital-type spine defects. We characterize three recessive zebrafish leviathan/col8a1a mutant alleles (m531, vu41, vu105) that disrupt collagen type VIII alpha1a (col8a1a), and cause folding of the embryonic notochord and consequently adult vertebral column malformations. Furthermore, we provide evidence that a transient loss of col8a1a function or inhibition of Lysyl oxidases with drugs during embryogenesis was sufficient to generate vertebral fusions and scoliosis in the adult spine. Using periodic imaging of individual zebrafish, we correlate focal notochord defects of the embryo with vertebral malformations (VM) in the adult. Finally, we show that bends and kinks in the notochord can lead to aberrant apposition of osteoblasts normally confined to well-segmented areas of the developing vertebral bodies. Our results afford a novel mechanism for the formation of VM, independent of defects of somitogenesis, resulting from aberrant bone deposition at regions of misshapen notochord tissue.",Notochord;Vertebral Malformations;Collagen;Osteoblast

Gene-gene expression correlations are a common source of molecular networks because they can be extracted from high-dimensional disease data and encapsulate the activity of multiple regulatory systems. However, the analysis of gene coexpression patterns is often treated as a mechanistic black box, in which looming “hub genes” direct cellular networks, and where other features are obscured. By examining the biophysical bases of coexpression and gene regulatory changes that occur in disease, recent studies suggest it is possible to use coexpression networks as a multi-omic screening procedure to generate novel hypotheses for disease mechanisms. Because technical processing steps can affect the outcome and interpretation of coexpression networks, we examine the assumptions and alternatives to common patterns of coexpression analysis and discuss additional topics such as acceptable datasets for coexpression analysis, the robust identification of modules, disease-related prioritization of genes and molecular systems and network meta-analysis. To accelerate coexpression research beyond modules and hubs, we highlight some emerging directions for coexpression network research that are especially relevant to complex brain disease, including the centrality-lethality relationship, integration with machine learning approaches and network pharmacology.",

Inhibition of TFPI enhances coagulation in hemophilia models. Using a library approach, we selected and subsequently optimized peptides that bind TFPI and block its anticoagulant activity. One peptide (termed compound 3), bound with high affinity to the Kunitz-1 (K1) domain of TFPI (Kd ∼1 nm). We solved the crystal structure of this peptide in complex with the K1 of TFPI at 2.55-Å resolution. The structure of compound 3 can be segmented into a N-terminal anchor; an Ω-shaped loop; an intermediate segment; a tight glycine-loop; and a C-terminal α-helix that is anchored to K1 at its reactive center loop and two-stranded β-sheet. The contact surface has an overall hydrophobic character with some charged hot spots. In a model system, compound 3 blocked FXa inhibition by TFPI (EC50 = 11 nm) and inhibition of TF-FVIIa-catalyzed FX activation by TFPI (EC50 = 2 nm). The peptide prevented transition from the loose to the tight FXa-TFPI complex, but did not affect formation of the loose FXa-TFPI complex. The K1 domain of TFPI binds and inhibits FVIIa and the K2 domain similarly inhibits FXa. Because compound 3 binds to K1, our data show that K1 is not only important for FVIIa inhibition but also for FXa inhibition, i.e. for the transition of the loose to the tight FXa-TFPI complex. This mode of action translates into normalization of coagulation of hemophilia plasmas. Compound 3 thus bears potential to prevent bleeding in hemophilia patients.",Coagulation Factors;Crystal Structure;Enzyme Inhibitors;Hemostasis;Peptide Interactions;Peptides;Protein Domains

We investigate the effect of lipids on DA-induced α-syn oligomerization and studied the ability of α-syn:DA oligomers to interact with lipids vesicles. Our results show that the interaction of α-syn with lipids inhibits the formation of DA-induced α-syn oligomers.

The recombinant protein in solution is a dimer characterized by an extensive α-helical structure and a well-folded tertiary structure. HpUreF binds two Ni2+ ions per dimer, with micromolar dissociation constant, as shown by calorimetry. X-ray absorption spectroscopic analysis indicates that the Ni2+ ions reside in a five-coordinate pyramidal geometry comprised exclusively of N/O-donor ligands derived from the protein, including one or two histidine imidazoles and carboxylate ligands. Binding of Ni2+ does not affect the solution properties of the protein. Mutation to alanine of His229 and/or Cys231, a pair of residues located on the protein surface that interacts with HpUreD, altered the affinity of the protein for Ni2+. This result, complemented by the XAS analysis, indicates that the Ni2+ binding site involves His229, and that Cys231 has an indirect structural role in metal binding.

Here we report the crystal structure of the mammalian GCK-GKRP complex in the presence of fructose 6-phosphate at a resolution of 3.50 Å The interaction interface, which totals 2060 Å2 of buried surface area, is characterized by a small number of polar contacts and substantial hydrophobic interactions. The structure of the complex reveals the molecular basis of disease states associated with impaired regulation of GCK by GKRP. It also offers insight into the modulation of complex stability by sugar phosphates. The atomic description of the mammalian GCK-GKRP complex provides a framework for the development of novel diabetes therapeutic agents that disrupt this critical macromolecular regulatory unit.",Glucokinase;Glucokinase Regulatory Protein;Type 2 Diabetes

In contrast to other structurally characterized antagonists, which mimic three amino acids of p53 (Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26), the compounds induced an additional hydrophobic pocket on the MDM2 surface and unveiled a four-point binding mode. The enlarged interaction interface of the inhibitors resulted in extension of small molecules binding toward the “lid” segment of MDM2 (residues 19–23)—a nascent element that interferes with p53 binding.

The physiological role of this novel proteolytic pathway is not yet clear, although in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the world's most threatening bacterial pathogen, Pup tagging is important for virulence. PafA, the Pup ligase, couples ATP hydrolysis with Pup conjugation to lysine side chains of protein substrates. PafA is the sole Pup ligase in M. tuberculosis and apparently, in other bacteria. Thus, whereas PafA is a key player in the Pup tagging (i.e. pupylation) system, control of its activity and interactions with target protein substrates remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined the mechanism of protein pupylation by PafA in Mycobacterium smegmatis, a model mycobacterial organism. We report that PafA is an allosteric enzyme that binds its target substrates cooperatively and find that PafA allostery is controlled by the binding of target protein substrates, yet is unaffected by Pup binding. Analysis of PafA pupylation using engineered substrates differing in the number of pupylation sites points to PafA acting as a dimer.

Spd1 has an inhibitory effect on ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), the activity of which is required for deoxynucleotide (dNTP) synthesis. The failure to degrade Spd1 in mutants where CRL4Cdt2 is defective leads to DNA integrity checkpoint activation and dependency. This correlates with a lower dNTP pool. Pools are restored in a spd1-deleted background and this also suppresses checkpoint activation and dependency. We hypothesized that fission yeast with RNR hyperactivity would display a mutator phenotype on their own, but also possibly repress aspects of the phenotype associated with the inability to target Spd1 for degradation. Here, we report that a mutation in the R1 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase cdc22 (cdc22-D57N), which alleviated allosteric feedback inhibition, caused a highly elevated dNTP pool that was further increased by deleting spd1. The Δspd1 cdc22-D57N double mutant had elevated mutation rates and was sensitive to damaging agents that cause DNA strand breaks, demonstrating that Spd1 can protect the genome when dNTP pools are high. In ddb1-deleted cells, cdc22-D57N also potently elevated RNR activity, but failed to allow cell growth independently of the intact checkpoint. Our results provide evidence that excess Spd1 interferes with other functions in addition to its inhibitory effect on ribonucleotide reduction to generate replication stress and genome instability.",Ribonucleotide reductase;Spd1;Genome instability;Checkpoint kinase;Ddb1

ASD is a complex disorder arising from a combination of multiple genetic and environmental factors that are independent from racial, ethnic and socioeconomical status. The high heritability of ASD suggests a strong genetic basis for the disorder. Furthermore, a mounting body of evidence implies a role of various ion channel gene defects (channelopathies) in the pathogenesis of autism. Indeed, recent genome-wide association, and whole exome- and whole-genome resequencing studies linked polymorphisms and rare variants in calcium, sodium and potassium channels and their subunits with susceptibility to ASD, much as they do with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Moreover, animal models with these genetic variations recapitulate endophenotypes considered to be correlates of autistic behavior seen in patients. An ion flux across the membrane regulates a variety of cell functions, from generation of action potentials to gene expression and cell morphology, thus it is not surprising that channelopathies have profound effects on brain functions. In the present work, we summarize existing evidence for the role of ion channel gene defects in the pathogenesis of autism with a focus on calcium signaling and its downstream effects.",calcium;mTOR;Fragile X syndrome;tuberous sclerosis;Rett syndrome;Prader-Willi syndrome;Angelman syndrome

Furthermore, mTOR inhibitors have antiepileptogenic properties in preventing epilepsy in animal models of TSC. Besides TSC, accumulating preclinical data suggest that mTOR inhibitors may have antiseizure or antiepileptogenic actions in other types of epilepsy, including infantile spasms, neonatal hypoxic seizures, absence epilepsy, and acquired temporal lobe epilepsy following brain injury, but these effects depend on a number of conditions.

In native conditions, PrPc has a structured C-terminal domain and a highly flexible N-terminal domain. A part of this N-terminal domain consists of 4–5 repeats of an unusual glycine-rich, eight amino acids long peptide known as the octapeptide repeat (OR) domain. In this article, we successfully report the first crystal structure of an OR of PrPc bound to the Fab fragment of the POM2 antibody. The structure was solved at a resolution of 2.3 Å by molecular replacement. Although several studies have previously predicted a β-turn-like structure of the unbound ORs, our structure shows an extended conformation of the OR when bound to a molecule of the POM2 Fab indicating that the bound Fab disrupts any putative native β turn conformation of the ORs. Encouraging results from several recent studies have shown that administering small molecule ligands or antibodies targeting the OR domain of PrP result in arresting the progress of peripheral prion infections both in ex vivo and in in vivo models. This makes the structural study of the interactions of POM2 Fab with the OR domain very important as it would help us to design smaller and tighter binding OR ligands.",octapeptide repeats;POM2 Fab;complementarity determining regions;β-turns;backbone interactions;hydrophobic interactions

In Drosophila, mouse, and human nuclei, chromosomes are spatially compartmentalized. Using 5C and Hi-C technologies, it has been shown that chromosomes form strings of topologi-cally associating domains (TADs) that are each hundreds of Kb in size but are spatially insulated from neighboring TADs. As a result, a given gene lives in a relatively small neighborhood where it encounters only a small section of the genome and thus can partner with only a small number of regulatory elements. Future studies will no doubt unveil how TADs are established and how they insulate genes from the wrong crowd.",

These chromosomal rearrangements result in fusion of the protein MLL to one of more than 60 protein partners. MLL fusions are potent inducers of leukemia through activation of oncogene expression; therefore, targeting this transcriptional activation function may arrest MLL-rearranged (MLL-R) leukemia. Leukemic cell lines harboring the most common fusion protein, MLL-AF4, require the direct interaction of AF4 with the transcription factor AF9 to survive and self-renew; disrupting this interaction with a cell-penetrating AF4-derived peptide results in cell death, suggesting that the AF4-AF9 interaction could be a viable target for a novel MLL-R leukemia therapy. Here we describe the use of AlphaScreen technology to develop a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to detect nonpeptidic inhibitors of AF4-AF9 binding. The assay is economical, requiring only low nanomolar concentrations of biotinylated AF4-derived peptide and FLAG-tagged AF9 in low-volume 384-well plates. A Z′-factor of 0.71 and a signal-to-background ratio of 21.3 showed the assay to be robust, and sensitivity to inhibition was demonstrated with competing AF4-derived peptides. Two pilot screens comprising 5,680 compounds served as validation for HTS at Nemours and the Broad Institute. Assay artifacts were excluded using a counterscreen comprising a biotinylated FLAG peptide.

A3G plays a key role in the anti-HIV-1 innate cellular immunity. The HIV-1 Vif protein counteracts A3G mainly by leading A3G towards the proteosomal machinery and by direct inhibition of its enzymatic activity. Both activities involve direct interaction between Vif and A3G. Disrupting the interaction between A3G and Vif may rescue A3G antiviral activity and inhibit HIV-1 propagation. Here, mapping the interaction sites between A3G and Vif by peptide array screening revealed distinct regions in Vif important for A3G binding, including the N-terminal domain (NTD), C-terminal domain (CTD) and residues 83–99. The Vif-binding sites in A3G included 12 different peptides that showed strong binding to either full-length Vif, Vif CTD or both. Sequence similarity was found between Vif-binding peptides from the A3G CTD and NTD. A3G peptides were synthesized and tested for their ability to counteract Vif action. A3G 211–225 inhibited HIV-1 replication in cell culture and impaired Vif dependent A3G degradation. In vivo co-localization of full-length Vif with A3G 211–225 was demonstrated by use of FRET. This peptide has the potential to serve as an anti-HIV-1 lead compound. Our results suggest a complex interaction between Vif and A3G that is mediated by discontinuous binding regions with different affinities.",A3G;Apobec-3G;HIV-1;Peptide arrays;Protein–protein interactions;Vif

W. Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany;Correspondence to:Juping Yuan, ed.trufknarf-inu.me@nauy","Polo-like kinase 1, a pivotal regulator of mitosis and cytokinesis, is highly expressed in a broad spectrum of tumors and its expression correlates often with poor prognosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. p53, the guardian of the genome, is the most important tumor suppressor. In this review, we address the intertwined relationship of these two key molecules by fighting each other as eternal rivals in many signaling pathways. p53 represses the promoter of Polo-like kinase 1, whereas Polo-like kinase 1 inhibits p53 and its family members p63 and p73 in cancer cells lacking functional p53. Plk1 inhibitors target all rapidly dividing cells irrespective of tumor cells or non-transformed normal but proliferating cells. Upon treatment with Plk1 inhibitors, p53 in tumor cells is activated and induces strong apoptosis, whereas tumor cells with inactive p53 arrest in mitosis with DNA damage. Thus, inactive p53 is not associated with a susceptible cytotoxicity of Polo-like kinase 1 inhibition and could rather foster the induction of polyploidy/aneuploidy in surviving cells. In addition, compared to the mono-treatment, combination of Polo-like kinase 1 inhibition with anti-mitotic or DNA damaging agents boosts more severe mitotic defects, effectually triggers apoptosis and strongly inhibits proliferation of cancer cells with functional p53. In this regard, restoration of p53 in tumor cells with loss or mutation of p53 will reinforce the cytotoxicity of combined Polo-like kinase 1 therapy and provide a proficient strategy for combating relapse and metastasis of cancer.",Oncotargets

Safra Campus, Givat Ram, 91904 Jerusalem, Israel","Microtubules (MTs) are nanometer scale hollow cylindrical biological polyelectrolytes. They are assembled from α/β-tubulin dimers, which stack to form protofilaments (PFs) with lateral interactions between PFs resulting in the curved MT. In cells, MTs and their assemblies are critical components in a range of functions from providing tracks for the transport of cargo to forming the spindle structure during mitosis. Previous studies have shown that while cations with valence equal to or larger than 3+ tend to assemble tight 3D bundles of taxol-stabilized MTs, certain divalent cations induce relatively loose 2D bundles of different symmetry [D. J. Needleman, et al., PNAS, 2004, 101, 16099]. Similarly, divalent cations form 2D bundles of DNA adsorbed on cationic membranes [I. Koltover, et al., PNAS, 2000, 97, 14046]. The bundling behavior for these biological polyelectrolyte systems is qualitatively in agreement with current theory. Here, we present results, which show that unlike the case for DNA adsorbed on cationic membranes, bundling of taxol-stabilized MTs occurs only for certain divalent cations above a critical ion concentration (e.g. Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+). Instead many divalent cations preempt the bundling transition and depolymerize taxol-stabilized MTs at a lower counterion concentration. Although previous cryogenic TEM has shown that, in the absence of taxol, Ca2+ depolymerizes MTs assembling in buffers containing GTP (guanosine triphosphate), our finding is surprising given the known stabilizing effects of taxol on GDP (guanosine diphosphate)-MTs. The ion concentration required for MT depolymerization decreases with increasing atomic number for the divalents Mg2+, Mn2+, Co2+, and Zn2+. GdCl3 (3+) is found to be extremely efficient at MT depolymerization requiring about 1 mM, while oligolysine (2+), is observed not to depolymerize MTs at concentrations as high as 144 mM. The surprising MT depolymerization results are discussed in the context of divalents disrupting either lateral interactions between PFs (which are strengthened for taxol containing β-tubulin) or interfering with taxol’s ability to induce flexibility at the interface between two tubulin dimers in the same PF (which has been recently suggested as a mechanism by which taxol stabilizes MTs post-hydrolysis with the induced flexibility counteracting the kink between GDP-tubulin dimers in a PF).",

Previous work has shown that MutM actively interrogates DNA for the presence of an intrahelical oxoG lesion. This interrogation process involves significant buckling and bending of the DNA to promote extrusion of oxoG from the duplex. Structural snapshots have revealed several different highly conserved residues that are prominently inserted into the duplex in the vicinity of the target oxoG before and after base extrusion has occurred. However, the roles of these helix-invading residues during the lesion recognition and base extrusion process remain unclear. In this study, we set out to probe the function of residues Phe114 and Met77 in oxoG recognition and repair. Here we report a detailed biochemical and structural characterization of MutM variants containing either a F114A or M77A mutation, both of which showed significant decreases in the efficiency of oxoG repair. These data reveal that Met77 plays an important role in stabilizing the lesion-extruded conformation of the DNA. Phe114, on the other hand, appears to destabilize the intrahelical state of the oxoG lesion, primarily by buckling the target base pair. We report the observation of a completely unexpected interaction state, in which the target base pair is ruptured but remains fully intrahelical; this structure vividly illustrates the disruptive influence of MutM on the target base pair.",Base Excision Repair;DNA-binding Protein;DNA Repair;DNA-Protein Interaction;Structural Biology

The exact order of immunological events remains obscure. Reviewing current literature, combined with careful clinical observations, we propose a model for granuloma formation in pulmonary sarcoidosis. A tight collaboration between macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocyte subsets, initiates the first steps toward granuloma formation, orchestrated by cytokines and chemokines. In a substantial part of pulmonary sarcoidosis patients, granuloma formation becomes an on-going process, leading to debilitating disease, and sometimes death. The immunological response, determining granuloma sustainment is not well understood. An impaired immunosuppressive function of regulatory T cells has been suggested to contribute to the exaggerated response. Interestingly, therapeutical agents commonly used in sarcoidosis, such as glucocorticosteroids and anti-TNF agents, interfere with granuloma integrity and restore the immune homeostasis in autoimmune disorders. Increasing insight into their mechanisms of action may contribute to the search for new therapeutical targets in pulmonary sarcoidosis.",pulmonary sarcoidosis;granuloma;formation;integrity;dendritic cells;T helper 1 cells;T helper 17 cells;regulatory T cells

We use NMR chemical shift difference mapping to show that non-specific interactions with particular base positions within the binding sequence, such as those of the “spacer”, affect the conformation of distinct regions of the rat glucocorticoid receptor DNA binding domain. These regions include the DNA-binding surface, the “lever arm” and the dimerization interface, suggesting an allosteric pathway that signals between the DNA binding sequence and the associated dimer partner. Disrupting this path by mutating the dimer interface alters sequence-specific conformations, DNA-binding kinetics and transcriptional activity.

The majority of eukaryotic genes can produce different transcripts due to alternative splicing or transcription initiation, and many such transcripts encode different protein isoforms. As analyses tend to be gene centered, one single-protein isoform per gene is selected for the alignment, with the de facto approach being to use the longest protein isoform per gene (Longest), presumably to avoid including partial sequences and to maximize sequence information. Here, we show that this approach is problematic because it increases the number of indels in the alignments due to the inclusion of nonhomologous regions, such as those derived from species-specific exons, increasing the number of misaligned positions. With the aim of ameliorating this problem, we have developed a novel heuristic, Protein ALignment Optimizer (PALO), which, for each gene family, selects the combination of protein isoforms that are most similar in length. We examine several evolutionary parameters inferred from alignments in which the only difference is the method used to select the protein isoform combination: Longest, PALO, the combination that results in the highest sequence conservation, and a randomly selected combination. We observe that Longest tends to overestimate both nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates when compared with PALO, which is most likely due to an excess of misaligned positions. The estimation of the fraction of genes that have experienced positive selection by maximum likelihood is very sensitive to the method of isoform selection employed, both when alignments are constructed with MAFFT and with Prank+F. Longest performs better than a random combination but still estimates up to 3 times more positively selected genes than the combination showing the highest conservation, indicating the presence of many false positives. We show that PALO can eliminate the majority of such false positives and thus that it is a more appropriate approach for large-scale analyses than Longest.

Three discontinuous chromogenic substrate initial rate assays were developed with different quenching conditions that enabled quantitation of the time courses of Pg depletion, plasmin (Pm) formation, transient formation of the conformationally activated SK·Pg* catalytic complex intermediate, formation of the SK·Pm catalytic complex, and the free concentrations of Pg, Pm, and SK. Analysis of full time courses of Pg activation by five concentrations of SK along with activity-based titrations of SK·Pg* and SK·Pm formation yielded rate and dissociation constants within 2-fold of those determined previously by continuous measurement of parabolic chromogenic substrate hydrolysis and fluorescence-based equilibrium binding. The results obtained with orthogonal assays provide independent support for a mechanism in which the conformationally activated SK·Pg* complex catalyzes an initial cycle of Pg proteolytic conversion to Pm that acts as a trigger. Higher affinity binding of the formed Pm to SK outcompetes Pg binding, terminating the trigger cycle and initiating the bullet catalytic cycle by the SK·Pm complex that converts the residual Pg into Pm. The new assays can be adapted to quantitate SK-Pg activation in the context of SK- or Pg-directed inhibitors, effectors, and SK allelic variants. To support this, we show for the first time with an assay specific for SK·Pg* that fibrinogen forms a ternary SK·Pg*·fibrinogen complex, which assembles with 200-fold enhanced SK·Pg* affinity, signaled by a perturbation of the SK·Pg* active site.",Enzyme Kinetics;Fibrinolysis;Plasmin;Plasminogen;Serine Protease;Full Time Course Kinetics;Streptokinase;Zymogen Activation

We show that the constitutive ACME-encoded arginine-deiminase system (Arc) allows USA300 to thrive in acidic environments that mimic human skin. Consequently, ACME-Arc drives excessive production of host polyamines, compounds uniquely toxic to S. aureus. To mitigate this, ACME also encodes SpeG, a polyamine-resistance enzyme that is essential for combating excess host polyamines in a murine SSTI model. Inhibiting host polyamine production not only restored ΔspeG persistence within infected wounds but also severely altered the host healing process, implying that polyamines play integral roles in coordinating the wound-healing response. Together, these data underscore the functional modularity of ACME and its contribution to the success of USA300 CA-MRSA.",

These conflicts arise because of differences in the viruses and genomic regions compared and in the methodology used. We have reexamined published sequences and found that synonymous substitutions were saturated in comparisons between and within virus genotypes. Analysis of complete genome sequences or concatenated ORF1/ORF2 amino acid sequences indicated that HEV variants most closely related to those infecting humans can be consistently divided into six genotypes (types 1 to 4 and two additional genotypes from wild boar). Variants isolated from rabbits, closely related to genotype 3, occupy an intermediate position. No consistent criteria could be defined for the assignment of virus subtypes. Analysis of amino acid sequences from these viruses with the more divergent variants from chickens, bats, and rodents in three conserved subgenomic regions (residues 1 to 452 or 974 to 1534 of ORF1 or residues 105 to 458 of ORF2) provided consistent support for a division into 4 groups, corresponding to HEV variants infecting humans and pigs, those infecting rats and ferrets, those from bats, and those from chickens. This approach may form the basis for a future genetic classification of HEV into four species, with the more divergent HEV-like virus from fish (cutthroat trout virus) representing a second genus.",

This includes controlling the production of organic acid anions (malate, citrate) that are excreted in copious amounts by proteoid roots of nonmycorrhizal species such as harsh hakea (Hakea prostrata). This, in turn, enhances the bioavailability of mineral-bound Pi by solubilizing Al3+, Fe3+, and Ca2+ phosphates in the rhizosphere. Harsh hakea thrives in the nutrient-impoverished, ancient soils of southwestern Australia. Proteoid roots from Pi-starved harsh hakea were analyzed over 20 d of development to correlate changes in malate and citrate exudation with PEPC activity, posttranslational modifications (inhibitory monoubiquitination versus activatory phosphorylation), and kinetic/allosteric properties. Immature proteoid roots contained an equivalent ratio of monoubiquitinated 110-kD and phosphorylated 107-kD PEPC polypeptides (p110 and p107, respectively). PEPC purification, immunoblotting, and mass spectrometry indicated that p110 and p107 are subunits of a 430-kD heterotetramer and that they both originate from the same plant-type PEPC gene. Incubation with a deubiquitinating enzyme converted the p110:p107 PEPC heterotetramer of immature proteoid roots into a p107 homotetramer while significantly increasing the enzyme’s activity under suboptimal but physiologically relevant assay conditions. Proteoid root maturation was paralleled by PEPC activation (e.g. reduced Km [PEP] coupled with elevated I50 [malate and Asp] values) via in vivo deubiquitination of p110 to p107, and subsequent phosphorylation of the deubiquitinated subunits. This novel mechanism of posttranslational control is hypothesized to contribute to the massive synthesis and excretion of organic acid anions that dominates the carbon metabolism of the mature proteoid roots.",

Modern optical methods, such as confocal microscopy, can noninvasively image such networks, but extracting a quantitative estimate of ξ0 is a nontrivial task. We present here a fast and simple method based on a two-dimensional bubble approach, which works by analyzing one by one the (thresholded) images of a series of three-dimensional thin data stacks. No skeletonization or reconstruction of the full geometry of the entire network is required. The method was validated by using many isotropic in silico generated networks of different structures, morphologies, and concentrations. For each type of network, the method provides accurate estimates (a few percent) of the average and the standard deviation of the three-dimensional distribution of the pore sizes, defined as the diameters of the largest spheres that can be fit into the pore zones of the entire gel volume. When applied to the analysis of real confocal microscopy images taken on fibrin gels, the method provides an estimate of ξ0 consistent with results from elastic light scattering data.",

Myelin sheath disruption is a common characteristic of several neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and various leukodystrophies. To date, the diagnosis of MS is obtained using a set of criteria in which MRI observations play a central role. However, because of the lack of specificity for myelin integrity, the use of MRI as the primary diagnostic tool has not yet been accepted. In order to improve MR specificity, we began developing MR probes targeted towards myelin. In this work we describe a new myelin-targeted MR contrast agent, Gd-DODAS, based on a stilbene binding moiety and demonstrate its ability to specifically bind to myelin in vitro and in vivo. We also present evidence that Gd-DODAS generates MR contrast in vivo in T1-weighed images and in T1 maps that correlates to the myelin content.",myelin;magnetic resonance imaging;multiple sclerosis;gadolinium;contrast agents;neuroimaging

Strong and continually developing evidence now suggests a link between disorders which involve Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis (HPA) dysregulation and the risk of developing psychiatric disease. For instance, adverse or excessive responses to stressful experiences are built into the diagnostic criteria for several psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety disorders. Interestingly, peripheral disorders such as metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases are also associated with HPA changes. Furthermore, many other systemic disorders associated with a higher incidence of psychiatric disease involve a significant inflammatory component. In fact, inflammatory and endocrine pathways seem to interact in both the periphery and the central nervous system (CNS) to potentiate states of psychiatric dysfunction. This review synthesizes clinical and animal data looking at interactions between peripheral and central factors, developing an understanding at the molecular and cellular level of how processes in the entire body can impact on mental state and psychiatric health.",mind-body interactions;psychiatric diseases;stress response;HPA axis;mood disorders;peripheral disorders;inflammatory processes

Diverse bNAbs recognizing different regions of the HIV-1 envelope have been identified and extensively studied. However, there is little information about the thermodynamics of binding of these bNAbs and their epitopes. We used isothermal titration calorimetry to characterize thermodynamically the interactions between bNAb 2F5 (in both the IgG and Fab forms) and its functional and core epitope peptides. We found that these interactions are enthalpically driven and opposed by a negative entropy change. The highest affinity was found for 2F5 IgG for its functional epitope, indicating that additional interactions involving residues flanking the core epitope contribute strongly to higher affinity. In addition, the strong influence of the Fc region on the binding affinity suggests long-range allosteric effects within IgG. Our results provide useful information for developing new therapeutics against HIV-1 and, in a broader scope, contribute to a better understanding of antigen-antibody recognition.",Antibodies;HIV-1;Isothermal Titration Calorimetry;Peptides;Thermodynamics;MPER;gp41

Sorting out the contribution of these mechanisms to any binding interaction remains a challenging task of general interest in biochemistry. Here we show that conformational selection is associated with a vast repertoire of kinetic behaviors, can never be disproved a priori as a mechanism of ligand binding, and is sufficient to explain the relaxation kinetics documented experimentally for a large number of systems. On the other hand, induced fit features a narrow spectrum of kinetic behaviors and can be disproved in many cases where conformational selection offers the only possible explanation. This conclusion offers a paradigm shift in the analysis of relaxation kinetics, with conformational selection acquiring pre-eminence as a mechanism of ligand binding. The dominant role of conformational selection supports the emerging structural view of the macromolecule as a conformational ensemble from which the ligand selects the initial optimal fit to produce a biological response.",

Recent studies suggest it has an important cognitive role, although there is no consensus about what this is. The region is typically discussed as having a unitary function because of a common pattern of relative deactivation observed during attentionally demanding tasks. One influential hypothesis is that the posterior cingulate cortex has a central role in supporting internally-directed cognition. It is a key node in the default mode network and shows increased activity when individuals retrieve autobiographical memories or plan for the future, as well as during unconstrained ‘rest’ when activity in the brain is ‘free-wheeling’. However, other evidence suggests that the region is highly heterogeneous and may play a direct role in regulating the focus of attention. In addition, its activity varies with arousal state and its interactions with other brain networks may be important for conscious awareness. Understanding posterior cingulate cortex function is likely to be of clinical importance. It is well protected against ischaemic stroke, and so there is relatively little neuropsychological data about the consequences of focal lesions. However, in other conditions abnormalities in the region are clearly linked to disease. For example, amyloid deposition and reduced metabolism is seen early in Alzheimer’s disease. Functional neuroimaging studies show abnormalities in a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, autism, depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, as well as ageing. Our own work has consistently shown abnormal posterior cingulate cortex function following traumatic brain injury, which predicts attentional impairments. Here we review the anatomy and physiology of the region and how it is affected in a range of clinical conditions, before discussing its proposed functions. We synthesize key findings into a novel model of the region’s function (the ‘Arousal, Balance and Breadth of Attention’ model). Dorsal and ventral subcomponents are functionally separated and differences in regional activity are explained by considering: (i) arousal state; (ii) whether attention is focused internally or externally; and (iii) the breadth of attentional focus. The predictions of the model can be tested within the framework of complex dynamic systems theory, and we propose that the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex influences attentional focus by ‘tuning’ whole-brain metastability and so adjusts how stable brain network activity is over time.",posterior cingulate cortex;attention: functional connectivity;default mode network;metastability

The low binding energy of NO on Co-TPP hinders an extensive investigation of the electronic structure but, on the other hand, enables a controlled desorption, providing a distinct writing process on a molecular level. While the bare molecules display no IETS signal, the NO-ligated porphyrin exhibits a clear activity of a single vibration at an energy of 31 meV. Due to exhaustive IETS simulations, it was possible to assign the origin of this singlet peak acquired above the ligated species. Among many vibrations, one unique mode was found to be active, corresponding to the Co–N–O in-plane rocking mode. The IETS propensity rules that were verified earlier on much simpler molecules are extended to these complex species. In summary, this combined experimental and theoretical work succeeds for the first time in getting a fingerprint of the vibronic characteristic of NO-Co-TPP on a noble metal surface. In the future, it will be interesting to extend this methodology to other gaseous adducts on nanoconfined metalloporphyrins and related complex metal-organic units.",porphyrin;Ag(111);NO;STM;inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy;DFT

This is because both have diverse applications in processed food manufacturing, leading to their widespread utilization by the food industry. Since most foods are naturally low in salt, sodium additives almost completely account for the excessive consumption of sodium throughout the world. Similarly, phosphorus additives represent a major and “hidden” phosphorus load in modern diets. These factors pose a major barrier to successfully lowering sodium or phosphorus intake in patients with chronic kidney disease. As such, any serious effort to reduce sodium or phosphorus consumption will require reductions in the use of these additives by the food industry. The current regulatory environment governing the use of food additives does not favor this goal, however, in large part because these additives have historically been classified as generally safe for public consumption. To overcome these barriers, coordinated efforts will be needed to demonstrate that high intakes of these additives are not safe for public consumption and as such, should be subject to greater regulatory scrutiny.",nutrition;diet;sodium;phosphorus;chronic kidney disease

Here, we demonstrate a high-vacuum oxidation strategy by atomic oxygen (AO) and investigate the AO induced functionalization and wettability transition in films made from basal-defect- and oxide-free graphene dispersions. These graphene-based films are neither graphene nor graphite, but graphene blocks constituted by numerous randomly stacked graphene flakes. It is found that AO induced functionalization of these films through the formation of epoxy groups, sp3 configuration, ether, and double and triple C–O groups. The films turn to be hydrophilic after exposed to AO. The contact angle increases with AO exposure time. This phenomenon is attributed to the lower surface roughness induced by collision and/or edge erosion of energetic ions to the film surface and is further explained by the Wenzel model. The demonstrated strategy can overcome limitations of Hummers method, provide possibility to gain functionalization and wettability transition in liquid-phase exfoliated basal-defect- and oxide-free graphene in the dry environment, and may extend the study and application of this material in spacecraft in low earth orbit.",Graphene;Atomic oxygen;Functionalization;Wettability

Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) are the detectors of choice for these applications. Recently a new type of SPAD detector was introduced, dubbed red-enhanced SPAD (RE-SPAD), with good sensitivity throughout the visible spectrum and with excellent timing performance. We report a characterization of this new detector for single-molecule fluorescence resonant energy transfer (smFRET) studies on freely diffusing molecules in a confocal geometry and alternating laser excitation (ALEX) scheme. We use a series of doubly-labeled DNA molecules with donor-to-acceptor distances covering the whole range of useful FRET values. Both intensity-based (μs-ALEX) and lifetime-based (ns-ALEX) measurements are presented and compared to identical measurements performed with standard thick SPADs. Our results demonstrate the great potential of this new detector for smFRET measurements and beyond.",SPAD;FRET;single-molecule;confocal;diffusion;ALEX;lifetime;TCSPC

Phylogenetic analysis of P1/capsid region sequences of isolates from each of the 403 cases reported in 2005 to 2011 resolved the outbreak into 23 independent type 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV2) emergences, at least 7 of which established circulating lineage groups. Virus from one emergence (lineage group 2005-8; 361 isolates) was estimated to have circulated for over 6 years. The population of the major cVDPV2 lineage group expanded rapidly in early 2009, fell sharply after two tOPV rounds in mid-2009, and gradually expanded again through 2011. The two major determinants of attenuation of the Sabin 2 oral poliovirus vaccine strain (A481 in the 5′-untranslated region [5′-UTR] and VP1-Ile143) had been replaced in all VDPV2 isolates; most A481 5′-UTR replacements occurred by recombination with other enteroviruses. cVDPV2 isolates representing different lineage groups had biological properties indistinguishable from those of wild polioviruses, including efficient growth in neuron-derived HEK293 cells, the capacity to cause paralytic disease in both humans and PVR-Tg21 transgenic mice, loss of the temperature-sensitive phenotype, and the capacity for sustained person-to-person transmission. We estimate from the poliomyelitis case count and the paralytic case-to-infection ratio for type 2 wild poliovirus infections that ∼700,000 cVDPV2 infections have occurred during the outbreak. The detection of multiple concurrent cVDPV2 outbreaks in northern Nigeria highlights the risks of cVDPV emergence accompanying tOPV use at low rates of coverage in developing countries.",

The polyproline region (PPR) and the macro domain of ORF1 protein may modulate virus production and/or the host immune response. We investigated the association between the genetic heterogeneity of HEV quasispecies in ORF1 and the outcome of infection in solid-organ transplant patients. Both sequence entropy and genetic distances during the hepatitis E acute phase were higher in patients whose infection became chronic than in those who cleared the virus. Hence, great quasispecies heterogeneity in the regions encoding the PPR and the macro domain may facilitate HEV persistence.",hepatitis E;chronic infection;ORF1;polyproline region;macro domain
