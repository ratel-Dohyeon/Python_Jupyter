IDPs (intrinsically disordered proteins) represent a class of proteins that do not fold into any particular conformation and exist as dynamic ensembles in their native state. Due to their intrinsic adaptability, IDPs participate in many regulatory biological processes, including parasite immune escape. Using the information from trypanosomatids proteomes, we developed a pipeline for the identification, characterization and analysis of IDPs. The pipeline employs six disorder prediction methodologies and integrates structural and functional annotation information, subcellular location prediction and physicochemical properties. At the core of the IDP pipeline, there is a relational database that describes the protein disorder knowledge in a logically consistent manner.",Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs);Trypanosomatids;IDP prediction

Each cell contains many proteins that lack a rigid 3-dimensional structure under physiological conditions. These dynamic proteins, called intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and protein regions (IDPRs), are predominantly involved in cell signaling and regulation. Yet, very little is known about their presence among proteins of the core autophagy machinery. In this work, we characterized the autophagy protein Atg3 from yeast and human along with 2 variants to show that Atg3 is an IDPRs-containing protein and that disorder/order predicted for these proteins from their amino acid sequence corresponds to their experimental characteristics. Based on this consensus, we applied the same prediction methods to all known Atg proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The data presented here provide an insight into the structural dynamics of each Atg protein. They also show that intrinsic disorder at various levels has to be taken into consideration for about half of the Atg proteins. This work should become a useful tool that will facilitate and encourage exploration of protein intrinsic disorder in autophagy.",Atg3;autophagy;intrinsically disordered protein;stress;vacuole;yeast

The recognition that proteins lacking tertiary stability, commonly referred to as intrinsically disordered proteins, mediate key signaling pathways suggests that protein structures without cooperative intramolecular interactions may also have the ability to couple local and global structure changes. Presented here are results from experiments that measured and tested the ability of disordered proteins to couple local changes in structure to global changes in structure. Using the intrinsically disordered N-terminal region of the p53 protein as an experimental model, a set of proline and alanine to glycine substitution variants were designed to modulate backbone conformational propensities without introducing non-native intramolecular interactions. The hydrodynamic radius (Rh) was used to monitor changes in global structure. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that the glycine substitutions decreased polyproline II (PPII) propensities relative to the wild type, as expected, and fluorescence methods indicated that substitution-induced changes in Rh were not associated with folding. The experiments showed that changes in local PPII structure cause changes in Rh that are variable and that depend on the intrinsic chain propensities of proline and alanine residues, demonstrating a mechanism for coupling local and global structure changes. Molecular simulations that model our results were used to extend the analysis to other proteins and illustrate the generality of the observed proline and alanine effects on the structures of intrinsically disordered proteins.",intrinsically disordered protein;proline;alanine;polyproline II;hydrodynamic radius

The structural disorder of IDPs/IDRs enables them to play essential functions that are complementary to those of ordered proteins. In addition, IDPs/IDRs are persistent in evolution. Therefore, they are expected to possess some advantages over ordered proteins. In this review, we summarize and survey nine possible advantages of IDPs/IDRs: economizing genome/protein resources, overcoming steric restrictions in binding, achieving high specificity with low affinity, increasing binding rate, facilitating posttranslational modifications, enabling flexible linkers, preventing aggregation, providing resistance to non-native conditions, and allowing compatibility with more available sequences. Some potential advantages of IDPs/IDRs are not well understood and require both experimental and theoretical approaches to decipher.

Several forms of cancer, such as acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and Ewing’s sarcoma (EWS), are caused by chromosomal translocation. Computational analysis of the 406 translocation-related human proteins revealed that these oncoproteins are significantly enriched in intrinsic disorder, with the translocation breakpoints being mostly located outside the functional domains.48 Furthermore, the vicinities of the breakpoint were shown to be even more disordered than the rest of these already highly disordered fusion proteins. These observations suggest that high levels of intrinsic disorder represent an important factor that helps fusion proteins to escape detection by cellular surveillance mechanisms that eliminate misfolded proteins and to live long enough to manifest their altered function(s).48 The authors found that these translocation-generated fusions enable long-range structural communication of remote binding and/or catalytic domains in the chimeric proteins and thereby define the acquired oncogenic functions. One of the illustrative examples of such acquired oncogenicity is the acquired intramolecular phosphorylation of the Bcr–Abl fusion protein related to CML and ALL. Here, chromosomal translocation results in fusion of a Tyr-kinase phosphorylation motif in Bcr with the Tyr-kinase domain within Abl, with disorder of the intervening region enabling intramolecular phosphorylation.48 Another mechanism is related to fusion of a dimerization/oligomerization domain with the kinase domain, generating an oligomeric hybrid protein. Subunits within such an oligomer are engaged in multiple mutual intermolecular phosphorylation reactions that promote autoactivation and generate novel binding sites for signaling proteins. Examples of this mechanism include TFG–ALK (TRK-fused gene–anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion) related to anaplastic large-cell lymphomas,49 constitutively activated TEL–Jak2 fusion (ETS translocation variant 6–Janus tyrosine kinase 2 fusion) with kinase activity in human leukemia,50 and NPM–ALK (nucleolar phosphoprotein nucleophosmin–anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion), the chimeric protein that is created by translocation in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and that requires the activation of its ALK kinase function as a result of oligomerization mediated by the NPM segment.51 Finally, chromosomal translocation can affect transcription factors, as illustrated by the EWS-ATF or EWS-Fli1 hybrids, where the DNA-binding element of transcription factors ATF1 or Fli1 is fused to the disordered transactivation domain of the EWS oncogene to generate an aberrant transcription factor related to Ewing sarcoma.35",

same simplistic thermodynamic rationale employed to explain
protein compaction, i.e., minimizing volume occupancy; macromolecular
crowding can favor protein–protein association, because it
also enables the system to decrease its volume. However, this statement
cannot be generalized, because some associations result in complexes

molecules.123 Therefore, macromolecular
crowding can either stabilize or destabilize protein–protein
interactions, depending on the size and shape of the reacting molecules

of assembly and disassembly of protein complexes with electrospray
mass spectrometry that helped with identification of the intermediate
subcomplexes present at each step of assembly and disassembly.102 First, on the basis of the analysis of simple
homo-oligomers, it has been concluded that some simple features of
the known crystal structures can be used for the efficient prediction
of the identities of the assembly intermediates, where at each disassembly
step the largest interfaces would be preserved and smaller interfaces
broken.103 Later studies of the more complex
hetero-oligomers supported this observation and revealed that disassociation
of a complex always occurs in such a way that the least amount of
buried interface area is exposed.104−106 Reversely, the assembly
of a complex should preferentially start with the formation of a subcomplex
with the largest interface. Because the per-residue interface and
surface areas of ordered proteins forming the three-state oligomers
are significantly smaller than those of the disordered monomers forming
the two-state multimers,64 this fact clearly
suggests that two-state subcomplexes will be formed first. In other
words, the very first step in the formation of a complex involves
binding-induced folding of some important IDPRs, which is followed
by the formation of complexes with small interface areas (i.e., the
interactions between the prefolded components). This order of events
makes perfect sense, because the binding-induced folding needed for
the formation of the two-state subcomplexes at the early stages of
the multimer assembly will undoubtedly generate more ordered species,
which will have their binding sites created as a result of the subcomplex
formation. In other words, for the complexes containing both large
and small interfaces, the folding-driven association leading to the
formation of the two-state subcomplexes is the necessary prerequisite
for the subsequent formation of the three-state ordered subcomplexes.",

However, it is often not clear whether this occurs via an “induced fit” or “conformational selection” mechanism, or via some intermediate scenario. In the first case, transient encounters with the binding partner favour transitions to the bound structure before the two proteins dissociate, while in the second the bound structure must be selected from a subset of unbound structures which are in the correct state for binding, because transient encounters of the incorrect conformation with the binding partner are most likely to result in dissociation. A particularly interesting situation involves those intrinsically disordered proteins which can bind to different binding partners in different conformations. We have devised a multi-state coarse-grained simulation model which is able to capture the binding of IDPs in alternate conformations, and by applying it to the binding of nuclear coactivator binding domain (NCBD) to either ACTR or IRF-3 we are able to determine the binding mechanism. By all measures, the binding of NCBD to either binding partner appears to occur via an induced fit mechanism. Nonetheless, we also show how a scenario closer to conformational selection could arise by choosing an alternative non-binding structure for NCBD.",

There has been much debate over whether the cancerous state can be said to originate in a single cell or whether it is a reflection of aberrant behaviour on the part of a ‘society of cells’. This article presents, in the form of a debate conducted among the authors, three views of how the problem might be addressed. We do not claim that the views exhaust all possibilities. These views are (a) the tissue organization field theory (TOFT) that is based on a breakdown of tissue organization involving many cells from different embryological layers, (b) the cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis that focuses on genetic and epigenetic changes that take place within single cells, and (c) the proposition that rewiring of the cell’s protein interaction networks mediated by intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) drives the tumorigenic process. The views are based on different philosophical approaches. In detail, they differ on some points and agree on others. It is left to the reader to decide whether one approach to understanding cancer appears more promising than the other.",Cancer;histogenesis;intrinsically disordered proteins;morphogenesis;protein interaction network;stroma-epithelium interaction;tissue organization field theory

A solvent exchange scheme is designed and performed to understand how the conformational preferences of the peptide are altered as the solvent shifts from DMSO to water. An ensemble of structures of a 19-residue peptide is determined based on 13Cα, 1Hα, and 1HN chemical shifts and with inter-proton distances. An experimental model is then presented where chemical shifts and amide-proton temperature dependence is probed at changing DMSO to water ratios. These co-solvent experiments provide evidence of a conformational change as the fraction of water increases by the stark change in the behavior of amide protons under varied temperature. This investigation provides a NMR based experimental method in the field of intrinsically disordered proteins to realize conformational transitions from a non-native set of structures (in DMSO) to a native set of disordered conformers (in water).",Intrinsically disordered protein (IDP);Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR);Solvent Perturbation;Nucleoporins

IDPs appear to have functional roles that diverge from those of folded proteins and revolve around their ability to act as hubs for protein-protein interactions. To gain a better understanding of the modes of binding of IDPs, we combined statistical mechanics, calorimetry, and NMR spectroscopy to investigate the recognition and binding of a fragment from the disordered protein Gab2 by the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), a key interaction for normal cell signaling and cancer development. Structural ensemble refinement by NMR chemical shifts, thermodynamics measurements, and analysis of point mutations indicated that the population of preexisting bound conformations in the free-state ensemble of Gab2 is an essential determinant for recognition and binding by Grb2. A key role was found for transient polyproline II (PPII) structures and extended conformations. Our findings are likely to have very general implications for the biological behavior of IDPs in light of the evidence that a large fraction of these proteins possess a specific propensity to form PPII and to adopt conformations that are more extended than the typical random-coil states.",

Within intrinsically disordered proteins, polyproline-II motifs are often located near sites of phosphorylation. We have used an unconventional experimental paradigm to discover that phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) occurs in the intrinsically disordered domain of hepatitis C virus non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) on Thr-2332 near one of its polyproline-II motifs. Phosphorylation shifts the conformational ensemble of the NS5A intrinsically disordered domain to a state that permits detection of the polyproline motif by using 15N-, 13C-based multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. PKA-dependent proline resonances were lost in the presence of the Src homology 3 domain of c-Src, consistent with formation of a complex. Changing Thr-2332 to alanine in hepatitis C virus genotype 1b reduced the steady-state level of RNA by 10-fold; this change was lethal for genotype 2a. The lethal phenotype could be rescued by changing Thr-2332 to glutamic acid, a phosphomimetic substitution. Immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy showed that the inability to produce Thr(P)-2332-NS5A caused loss of integrity of the virus-induced membranous web/replication organelle. An even more extreme phenotype was observed in the presence of small molecule inhibitors of PKA. We conclude that the PKA-phosphorylated form of NS5A exhibits unique structure and function relative to the unphosphorylated protein. We suggest that post-translational modification of viral proteins containing intrinsic disorder may be a general mechanism to expand the viral proteome without a corresponding expansion of the genome.",Hepatitis C Virus (HCV);Intrinsically Disordered Protein;Phosphorylation;RNA Virus;Viral Replication;NMR;Non-structural Protein 5A

Functions of these intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are typically related to regulation, signaling, and control. Cellular levels of these important regulators are tightly regulated by a variety mechanisms ranging from firmly controlled expression to precisely targeted degradation. Functions of IDPs are controlled by binding to specific partners, alternative splicing, and posttranslational modifications among other means. In the norm, right amounts of precisely activated IDPs have to be present in right time at right places. Wrecked regulation brings havoc to the ordered world of disordered proteins, leading to protein misfolding, misidentification, and missignaling that give rise to numerous human diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, and diabetes. Among factors inducing pathogenic transformations of IDPs are various cellular mechanisms, such as chromosomal translocations, damaged splicing, altered expression, frustrated posttranslational modifications, aberrant proteolytic degradation, and defective trafficking. This review presents some of the aspects of deregulated regulation of IDPs leading to human diseases.",intrinsically disordered proteins;conformational diseases;posttranslational modification;alternative splicing;transcriptional activation;expression;proteolytic degradation;trafficking

We analyzed the interdomain region of Thermococcus kodakarensis Hef and demonstrated its disordered structure by CD, NMR, and high speed atomic force microscopy (AFM). To investigate the functions of this intrinsically disordered region (IDR), we screened for proteins interacting with the IDR of Hef by a yeast two-hybrid method, and 10 candidate proteins were obtained. We found that PCNA1 and a RecJ-like protein specifically bind to the IDR in vitro.

The formation of a polybivalent scaffold is a key process by which IDPs drive early steps in macromolecular assemblies. Three intrinsically disordered proteins, IC, Swallow and Nup159, are core components, respectively, of cytoplasmic dynein, bicoid mRNA localization apparatus, and nuclear pore complexes. In all three systems, the hub protein LC8 recognizes on the IDP, short linear motifs that are fully disordered in the apo form, but adopt a β-strand when bound to LC8. The IDP/LC8 complex forms a bivalent scaffold primed to bind additional bivalent ligands. Scaffold formation also promotes self-association and/or higher order organization of the IDP components at a site distant from LC8 binding. Rigorous thermodynamic analyses imply that association of additional bivalent ligands is driven by entropic effects where the first binding event is weak but subsequent binding of additional ligands occurs with higher affinity. Here, we review specific examples of macromolecular assemblies in which polybivalency of aligned IDP duplexes not only enhances binding affinity and results in formation of a stable complex but also compensates unfavorable steric and enthalpic interactions. We propose that polybivalent scaffold assembly involving IDPs and LC8-like proteins is a general process in the cell biology of a class of multi-protein structures that are stable yet fine-tuned for diverse cellular requirements.",Intrinsically disordered proteins;LC8;macromolecular assembly;bivalency;poly-bivalent scaffold;enthalpy-entropy compensation

The tubulin tails form a lawn of densely grafted, negatively charged, flexible peptides on the exterior of the microtubule, potentially akin to brush polymers in the field of synthetic materials. These tails are hotspots for conserved, chemically complex posttranslational modifications that have the potential to act in a combinatorial fashion to regulate microtubule polymer dynamics and interactions with microtubule effectors, giving rise to a “tubulin code”. In this review, I summarize our current knowledge of the enzymes that generate the astonishing tubulin chemical diversity observed in cells and describe recent advances in deciphering the roles of tubulin C-terminal tails and their posttranslational modifications in regulating the activity of molecular motors and microtubule associated proteins.

Because of their large extinction coefficients and quantum yields, synthetic heteroaromatic chromophores covalently linked to the protein are often used as donor and acceptor fluorophores. A key issue in the interpretation of such experiments is the extent to which the properties of the unfolded chain may be affected by the presence of these chromophores. In this article, we investigate this question using all-atom explicit solvent replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations of three different unfolded or intrinsically disordered proteins. We find that the secondary structure and long-range contacts are largely the same in the presence or absence of the fluorophores, and that the dimensions of the chain with and without chromophores are similar. This suggests that, at least in the cases studied, extrinsic fluorophores have little effect on the structural properties of unfolded or disordered proteins. We also find that the critical FRET orientational factor κ2, has an average value and equilibrium distribution very close to that expected for isotropic orientations, which supports one of the assumptions frequently made when interpreting FRET efficiency in terms of distances.",

Everything about this protein, its structure, functions, and folding, is mysteriously counterintuitive, and this review represents an attempt to solve some of the riddles and conundrums commonly found in the field of actin research. In fact, actin is a promiscuous binder with a wide spectrum of biological activities. It can exist in at least three structural forms, globular, fibrillar, and inactive (G-, F-, and I-actin, respectively). G-actin represents a thermodynamically instable, quasi-stationary state, which is formed in vivo as a result of the energy-intensive, complex posttranslational folding events controlled and driven by cellular folding machinery. The G-actin structure is dependent on the ATP and Mg2+ binding (which in vitro is typically substituted by Ca2+) and protein is easily converted to the I-actin by the removal of metal ions and by action of various denaturing agents (pH, temperature, and chemical denaturants). I-actin cannot be converted back to the G-form. Foldable and “natively folded” forms of actin are always involved in interactions either with the specific protein partners, such as Hsp70 chaperone, prefoldin, and the CCT chaperonin during the actin folding in vivo or with Mg2+ and ATP as it takes place in the G-form. We emphasize that the solutions for the mysteries of actin multifunctionality, multistructurality, and trapped unfolding can be found in the quasi-stationary nature of this enigmatic protein, which clearly possesses many features attributed to both globular and intrinsically disordered proteins.",actin;multifunctional protein;microfilaments;signal transduction;hub protein

Homozygous mutant mice of five lines developed normally, with normal levels of methylation on both imprinted and nonimprinted DNA sequences. The other two lines, however, had alterations in imprinted and/or nonimprinted (global) DNA methylation appearing during embryonic development. Embryos of one line expressing a DNMT1 variant containing a 6-aa rat orthologous sequence in the IDD maintained imprinted methylation, showed very reduced levels of global methylation and occasionally completed fetal development. These in vivo studies demonstrate that at least two DNMT1-dependent methylation processes can be distinguished during fetal development. One process maintains the bulk of genomic methylation on nonimprinted sequences. The other process maintains methylation on a much smaller class of sequences including but not limited to gametic differentially methylated domains (gDMDs) that transmit essential imprinted parent-specific methylation for embryonic development.",DNA methylation;Dnmt1;genomic imprinting;intrinsically disordered protein;methyltransferase

For detailed structural ensemble modeling of IDRs, we propose a multiscale method for IDRs that possess significant long-range order in modular proteins and apply it to the eukaryotic transcription factor p53 as an example. First, we performed all-atom (AA) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the explicitly solvated p53 linker region, without experimental restraint terms, finding fractional long-range contacts within the linker. Second, we fed this AA MD ensemble into a coarse-grained (CG) model, finding an optimal set of contact potentials. The optimized CG MD simulations reproduced the contact probability map from the AA MD simulations. Finally, we performed the CG MD simulation of the tetrameric p53 fragments including the core domains, the linker, and the tetramerization domain. Using the obtained ensemble, we theoretically calculated the small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) profile of this fragment. The obtained SAXS profile agrees well with the experiment. We also found that the long-range contacts in the p53 linker region are required to reproduce the experimental SAXS profile. The developed framework in which we calculate the long-range contact probability map from the AA MD simulation and incorporate it to the CG model can be applied to broad range of IDRs.",

In this report, we demonstrate that the Drosophila melanogaster dTIS11 protein is short-lived due to its rapid ubiquitin-independent degradation by the proteasome. Our data indicate that this mechanism is tightly associated with the intrinsically unstructured, disordered N- and C-terminal domains of the protein. Furthermore, we show that TTP, the mammalian TIS11/TTP protein prototype, shares the same three-dimensional characteristics and is degraded by the same proteolytic pathway as dTIS11, thereby indicating that this mechanism has been conserved across evolution.

As a group, RNA-binding proteins (RNA-BPs) have been described as enriched in intrinsically disordered regions, thus raising the possibility that the mechanism that we uncovered for TIS11/TTP turnover is widespread among other RNA-BPs.",

From a practical point of view, however, such disordered regions often can pose significant challenges for crystallization. Disordered regions are also detrimental to NMR spectral quality, complicating the analysis of resonance assignments and three-dimensional protein structures by NMR methods. The DisMeta Server has been used by Northeastern Structural Genomics Consortium (NESG) as a primary tool for construct design and optimization in preparing samples for both NMR and crystallization studies. It is a meta-server that generates a consensus analysis of eight different sequence-based disorder predictors to identify regions that are likely to be disordered. DisMeta also identifies predicted secretion signal peptides, trans-membrane segments, and low complexity regions. Identification of disordered regions, by either experimental or computational methods, is an important step in the NESG structure production pipeline, allowing the rational design of protein constructs that have improved expression and solubility, improved crystallization, and better quality NMR spectra.",intrinsically disorder protein prediction;construct design;construct optimization;hydrogen-deuterium exchange with mass spectrometry (HDX-MS)

Many IDPs can interact with multiple binding partners, resulting in their folding into alternative ligand-specific functional structures. For such multi-structural IDPs, a key question is whether these multiple structures are fully encoded in the protein sequence, as is the case in many globular proteins. To answer this question, here we employed a combination of single-molecule and ensemble techniques to compare ligand-induced and osmolyte-forced folding of α-synuclein. Our results reveal context-dependent modulation of the protein’s folding landscape, suggesting that the codes for the protein’s native folds are partially encoded in its primary sequence, and are completed only upon interaction with binding partners.

We established by multiple biophysical and biochemical approaches that Hug1 is an intrinsically disordered protein that directly binds to the small RNR subunit Rnr2. We characterized the surface of interaction involved in Hug1 binding to Rnr2, and we thus defined a new binding region to Rnr2. Moreover, we show that Hug1 is deleterious to cell growth in the context of reduced RNR activity. This inhibitory effect of Hug1 on RNR activity depends on the binding of Hug1 to Rnr2. We propose a model in which Hug1 modulates Rnr2–Rnr1 association by binding Rnr2. We show that Hug1 accumulates under various physiological conditions of high RNR induction. Hence, both the regulation and the mode of action of Hug1 are different from those of the small protein inhibitors Dif1 and Sml1, and Hug1 can be considered as a regulator for fine-tuning of RNR activity.",

The λ N protein was uniformly labeled with 2H, and the concentrations of D2O in the samples were adjusted to match the neutron scattering contrast of the unlabeled crowding proteins, thereby masking their contribution to the scattering profiles. Scattering from the deuterated λ N was recorded for samples containing up to 0.12 g/mL bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor or 0.2 g/mL metmyoglobin. The radius of gyration of the uncrowded protein was estimated to be 30 Å and was found to be remarkably insensitive to the presence of crowders, varying by <2 Å for the highest crowder concentrations. The scattering profiles were also used to estimate the fractal dimension of λ N, which was found to be ∼1.8 in the absence or presence of crowders, indicative of a well-solvated and expanded random coil under all of the conditions examined. These results are contrary to the predictions of theoretical treatments and previous experimental studies demonstrating compaction of unfolded proteins by crowding with polymers such as dextran and Ficoll. A computational simulation suggests that some previous treatments may have overestimated the effective volumes of disordered proteins and the variation of these volumes within an ensemble. The apparent insensitivity of λ N to crowding may also be due in part to weak attractive interactions with the crowding proteins, which may compensate for the effects of steric exclusion.",

However, the mechanisms by which viral proteins interact with such large numbers of factors remain unknown. Cellular proteins that interact with multiple, distinct partners often do so through short sequences known as molecular recognition features (MoRFs) embedded within intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). In this study, we report the first evidence that MoRFs in viral proteins play a similar role in targeting the host cell. Using a combination of evolutionary modeling, protein–protein interaction analyses and forward genetic screening, we systematically investigated two computationally predicted MoRFs within the N-terminal IDR of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) Core protein. Sequence analysis of the MoRFs showed their conservation across all HCV genotypes and the canine and equine Hepaciviruses. Phylogenetic modeling indicated that the Core MoRFs are under stronger purifying selection than the surrounding sequence, suggesting that these modules have a biological function. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we identified three cellular binding partners for each HCV Core MoRF, including two previously characterized cellular targets of HCV Core (DDX3X and NPM1). Random and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the predicted MoRF regions were required for binding to the cellular proteins, but that different residues within each MoRF were critical for binding to different partners. This study demonstrated that viruses may use intrinsic disorder to target multiple cellular proteins with the same amino acid sequence and provides a framework for characterizing the binding partners of other disordered regions in viral and cellular proteomes.",virus;viral protein;hepatitis C virus;hepatitis virus;host–pathogen interactions;protein–protein interactions;intrinsically disordered proteins;systems biology

Disordered regions can be identified experimentally, with techniques such as limited proteolysis coupled with mass spectrometry, or computationally, by using disorder prediction programs, of which many are available. Although these programs use various methods to predict disorder from a protein’s primary sequence, they all were developed using information derived from soluble protein structures. Therefore, their performance and accuracy when applied to integral membrane proteins remained an open question. We evaluated the performance of 13 disorder prediction programs on a dataset containing 343 membrane proteins, and upon subdatasets containing only α-helical or β-barrel proteins. These programs were ranked using multiple metrics, including metrics specifically created for membrane proteins. Analysis of these data shows a clear distinction between programs that accurately predict disordered regions in membrane proteins and programs which perform poorly, and allows for the robust integration of in silico disorder prediction into our PSI:Biology membrane protein structural genomics pipeline.",

The lengths of the disordered segments that affect protein half-life are compatible with the structure of the proteasome. Divergence in terminal and internal disordered segments in yeast proteins originating from gene duplication leads to significantly altered half-life. Many paralogs that are affected by such changes participate in signaling, where altered protein half-life will directly impact cellular processes and function.

There are four main categories of glycosylation: (i) N-linked glycosylation (addition of the sugars to the amide group (NH2) of an asparagine of secreted or membrane-bound proteins), (ii) O-linked glycosylation (addition of the sugar to the hydroxyl group (OH) of a serine or a threonine), (iii) C-mannosylation (addition of a mannose sugar to tryptophan), and (iv) GPI anchors (see lipid anchor modifications).277 Often, oligosaccharides constitute a significant fraction of the mass of glycoproteins and glycopeptides and therefore can significantly affect peptide backbone behavior.278–281 Similar to several other PTMs (e.g., phosphorylation), structural consequences of protein glycosylation are difficult to predict, because this modification is known to stabilize some proteins and lead to the destabilization and local unfolding of other proteins. Through their bulky hydrophilic character, glycans often increase solubility and resistance to proteolysis of the protein to which they are attached. Moreover, glycosylation modulates structural and conformational characteristics of proteins by affecting differently the thermodynamics (enthalpy or entropy) of the unfolded and/or folded state, enhancing both the thermodynamic and the kinetic stability of proteins.282 It was also reported that glycosylation helps in the formation of a secondary structure of a peptide backbone, especially the β-turn,283–285 and stabilizes the peptide backbone conformation.286–288 However, carbohydrate moieties were also shown to induce local structural perturbations, affecting the α-helical structure around the glycosylation sites,289 or even promote complete disruption of α-helical structure.290 Attachment of glycans inhibits transient interactions in the unfolded state, leading to its destabilization (or the formation of an unfolded state with a higher enthalpy). In other words, glycosylation reduces residual structure typically found in the unfolded proteins, therefore making them more unfolded and resulting in a significant increase in their radius of gyration.282 The degree of destabilization of the unfolded state increases with the degree of glycosylation. As a result, the unfolded state ensembles of the glycosylated proteins are more extended in comparison with the conformational ensembles of the nonglycosylated proteins, and their dimensions correlate with the degree of glycosylation.282",

Ferritin can bind to a histidine–glycine–lysine-rich region within HK5 and block its antiangiogenic effects. However, the molecular intricacies of this interaction are not well understood. Analysis of the structure of HK5 using circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance [1H, 15N]-heteronuclear single quantum coherence determined that HK5 is an intrinsically unstructured protein, consistent with secondary structure predictions. Equilibrium binding studies using fluorescence anisotropy were used to study the interaction between ferritin and HK5. The interaction between the two proteins is mediated by metal ions such as Co2+, Cd2+, and Fe2+. This metal-mediated interaction works independently of the loaded ferrihydrite core of ferritin and is demonstrated to be a surface interaction.

NR-mediated gene expression can be modulated by coactivators and corepressors through direct physical interaction or protein complexes with functional domains in NRs. One class of these domains includes short linear motifs (SLiMs), which facilitate protein-protein interactions, phosphorylation, and ligand binding primarily in the intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins. Across all proteins, the number of known SLiMs is limited due to the difficulty in studying IDRs experimentally. Computational tools provide a systematic and data-driven approach for predicting functional motifs that can be used to prioritize experimental efforts. Accordingly, several tools have been developed based on sequence conservation or biophysical features; however, discrepancies in predictions make it difficult to determine the true candidate SLiMs. In this work, we present the ensemble predictor for short linear motifs (EPSLiM), a novel strategy to prioritize the residues that are most likely to be SLiMs in IDRs. EPSLiM applies a generalized linear model to integrate predictions from individual methodologies. We show that EPSLiM outperforms individual predictors, and we apply our method to NRs. The androgen receptor is an example with an N-terminal domain of 559 disordered amino acids that contains several validated SLiMs important for transcriptional activation. We use the androgen receptor to illustrate the predictive performance of EPSLiM and make the results of all human and mouse NRs publically available through the web service http://epslim.bwh.harvard.edu.",

Our data shows that the conserved domains shared between DBC1 and CCAR1 have similar domain structures, as well as similar patterns of predicted disorder in less-conserved intrinsically disordered regions. Our analysis indicates similarities between DBC1, CCAR1, and the nematode protein lateral signaling target 3 (LST-3), suggesting that DBC1 and CCAR1 may have evolved from LST-3. Our data also suggests that DBC1 emerged later in evolution than CCAR1. DBC1 contains regions that show less conservation across species as compared to the same regions in CCAR1, suggesting a continuously evolving scenario for DBC1.

These domains are versatile and can perform a wide range of functions. Many of these domains readily unfold on disulfide bond reduction, suggesting that in the absence of covalent bonding they might display significant disorder. Results: Here, we analyzed the degree of disorder in 97 domains representative of the different DRDs families and demonstrate that, in terms of sequence, many of them can be classified as intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or contain predicted disordered regions. The analysis of the aggregation propensity of these domains indicates that, similar to IDPs, their sequences are more soluble and have less aggregating regions than those of other globular domains, suggesting that they might have evolved to avoid aggregation after protein synthesis and before they can attain its compact and covalently linked native structure. Innovation and Conclusion: DRDs, which resemble IDPs in the reduced state and become globular when their disulfide bonds are formed, illustrate the link between protein folding and aggregation propensities and how these two properties cannot be easily dissociated, determining the main traits of the folding routes followed by these small proteins to attain their native oxidized states.

Biophysical characterization of these fragments revealed that the Sld2 homologous RecQL4 N-terminal domain carries large intrinsically disordered regions. The N-terminal fragments were sufficient for the strong annealing activity of RecQL4. Moreover, this activity appeared to be the basis for an ATP-independent strand exchange activity. Both activities relied on multiple DNA-binding sites with affinities to single-stranded, double-stranded and Y-structured DNA. Finally, we found a remarkable affinity of the N-terminus for guanine quadruplex (G4) DNA, exceeding the affinities for other DNA structures by at least 60-fold.

PTMs, however, may interact or interfere with one another when regulating protein function. Yet, characterization of the structural and functional signatures of their crosstalk has been hindered by the scarcity of data. To this end, we developed a unified sequence-based predictor of 23 types of PTM sites that, we believe, is a useful tool in guiding biological experiments and data interpretation. We then used experimentally determined and predicted PTM sites to investigate two particular cases of potential PTM crosstalk in eukaryotes. First, we identified proteins statistically enriched in multiple types of PTM sites and found that they show preferences toward intrinsically disordered regions as well as functional roles in transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and developmental processes. Second, we observed that target sites modified by more than one type of PTM, referred to as shared PTM sites, show even stronger preferences toward disordered regions than their single-PTM counterparts; we explain this by the need for these regions to accommodate multiple partners. Finally, we investigated the influence of single and shared PTMs on differential regulation of protein–protein interactions. We provide evidence that molecular recognition features (MoRFs) show significant preferences for PTM sites, particularly shared PTM sites, implicating PTMs in the modulation of this specific type of macromolecular recognition. We conclude that intrinsic disorder is a strong structural prerequisite for complex PTM-based regulation, particularly in context-dependent protein–protein interactions related to transcriptional and developmental processes.

a method based on the algorithm proposed by Gelb.24 Monte Carlo sampling on complex, multidimensional energy
landscapes can be improved by the introduction of an auxiliary Markov
chain that draws conformations from a Boltzmann distribution governed
by an approximate potential energy function. Gelb’s proposal,
referred to in the literature as Nested Markov Chain Monte Carlo or
NMCMC,25 was motivated by the need to reduce
computational costs associated with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling
when using quantum mechanical and polarizable Hamiltonians that are
expensive even for single point energy calculations. The formalism
developed by Gelb satisfies detailed balance and can be adapted to
any pair of Hamiltonians, where only one of the Hamiltonians is of
interest. The other can, in theory, be any conceivable approximation,
as long as it is useful and helps achieve efficient sampling. We refer
to our adaptation of Gelb’s formalism as Hamiltonian
Switch Metropolis Monte Carlo or HS-MMC. This terminology
highlights the fact that we engineer a switch between distinct Hamiltonians
(potential functions) and uses the Metropolis criterion for Markov
Chain Monte Carlo simulations. In the following sections, we describe
the details of this method and show three examples of realistic sampling
problems that are overcome by its use.",

In this study, using the established cells for inducibly expressing hSCP1 proteins, we monitored the modification of β-O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc). O-GlcNAcylation is one of the most common post-translational modifications (PTMs). To gain insight into the PTM of hSCP1, we used the Western blot, immunoprecipitation, succinylayed wheat germ agglutininprecipitation, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses, and site-directed mutagenesis and identified the Ser41 residue of hSCP1 as the O-GlcNAc modification site. These results suggest that hSCP1 may be an O-GlcNAcylated protein in vivo, and its N-terminus may function a possible role in the PTM, providing a scaffold for binding the protein(s).

Accordingly, proteins governing such events are evolutionary conserved, even among distant organisms. By contrast, it is more singular the case of “core functions” exerted by functional analogous proteins that are not homologous and do not share any kind of structural similarity. This is the case of proteins regulating the G1/S transition in higher eukaryotes–i.e., the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor Rb—and budding yeast, i.e., Whi5. The interaction landscape of Rb and Whi5 is quite large, with more than one hundred proteins interacting either genetically or physically with each protein. The Whi5 interactome has been used to construct a concept map of Whi5 function and regulation. Comparison of physical and genetic interactors of Rb and Whi5 allows highlighting a significant core of conserved, common functionalities associated with the interactors indicating that structure and function of the network—rather than individual proteins—are conserved during evolution. A combined bioinformatics and biochemical approach has shown that the whole Whi5 protein is highly disordered, except for a small region containing the protein family signature. The comparison with Whi5 homologs from Saccharomycetales has prompted the hypothesis of a modular organization of structural disorder, with most evolutionary conserved regions alternating with highly variable ones. The finding of a consensus sequence points to the conservation of a specific phosphorylation rhythm along with two disordered sequence motifs, probably acting as phosphorylation-dependent seeds in Whi5 folding/unfolding. Thus, the widely disordered Whi5 appears to act as a hierarchical, “date hub” that has evolutionary assayed an original way of modular organization before being supplanted by the globular, multi-domain structured Rb, more suitable to cover the role of a “party hub”.",structural disorder;protein evolution;protein hub;date hub;party hub;multisite phosphorylation;systems biology;cell cycle

disordered proteins, which play major roles in desiccation tolerance. In
Arabidopsis thaliana, 51 genes encoding LEA proteins clustered
into nine families have been inventoried. To increase our understanding of the yet
enigmatic functions of these gene families, we report the subcellular location of
each protein. Experimental data highlight the limits of in silico predictions for
analysis of subcellular localization. Thirty-six LEA proteins localized to the
cytosol, with most being able to diffuse into the nucleus. Three proteins were
exclusively localized in plastids or mitochondria, while two others were found dually
targeted to these organelles. Targeting cleavage sites could be determined for five
of these proteins. Three proteins were found to be endoplasmic reticulum (ER) residents, two were vacuolar, and two were
secreted. A single protein was identified in pexophagosomes. While most LEA protein
families have a unique subcellular localization, members of the LEA_4 family are
widely distributed (cytosol, mitochondria, plastid, ER, and pexophagosome) but share the presence of the class A
α-helix motif. They are thus expected to establish interactions with various
cellular membranes under stress conditions. The broad subcellular distribution of LEA
proteins highlights the requirement for each cellular compartment to be provided with
protective mechanisms to cope with desiccation or cold stress.",

Obviously, slightly salted aqueous solutions containing low concentrations of a biomolecule of interest are too simplistic to mimic the “real life” situation, where the biomolecule of interest scrambles and wades through the tightly packed crowd. In laboratory practice, such macromolecular crowding is typically mimicked by concentrated solutions of various polymers that serve as model “crowding agents”. Studies under these conditions revealed that macromolecular crowding might affect protein structure, folding, shape, conformational stability, binding of small molecules, enzymatic activity, protein-protein interactions, protein-nucleic acid interactions, and pathological aggregation. The goal of this review is to systematically analyze currently available experimental data on the variety of effects of macromolecular crowding on a protein molecule.

Plants native to cold climates acquire increased freezing tolerance during exposure to low nonfreezing temperatures in a process termed cold acclimation. This involves many adaptative responses, including global changes in metabolite content and gene expression, and the accumulation of cold-regulated (COR) proteins, whose functions are largely unknown. Here we report that the chloroplast proteins COR15A and COR15B are necessary for full cold acclimation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). They protect cell membranes, as indicated by electrolyte leakage and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements. Recombinant COR15 proteins stabilize lactate dehydrogenase during freezing in vitro. However, a transgenic approach shows that they have no influence on the stability of selected plastidic enzymes in vivo, although cold acclimation results in increased enzyme stability. This indicates that enzymes are stabilized by other mechanisms. Recombinant COR15 proteins are disordered in water, but fold into amphipathic α-helices at high osmolyte concentrations in the presence of membranes, a condition mimicking molecular crowding induced by dehydration during freezing. X-ray scattering experiments indicate protein-membrane interactions specifically under such crowding conditions. The COR15-membrane interactions lead to liposome stabilization during freezing. Collectively, our data demonstrate the requirement for COR15 accumulation for full cold acclimation of Arabidopsis. The function of these intrinsically disordered proteins is the stabilization of chloroplast membranes during freezing through a folding and binding mechanism, but not the stabilization of chloroplastic enzymes. This indicates a high functional specificity of these disordered plant proteins.",

Despite the importance of a protein's structure and conformational dynamics to its function and thus its fitness, common phylogenetic methods embody minimal biophysical knowledge of proteins. To underscore the biophysical constraints on natural selection, we survey effects of protein mutations, highlighting the physical basis for marginal stability of natural globular proteins and how requirement for kinetic stability and avoidance of misfolding and misinteractions might have affected protein evolution. The biophysical underpinnings of these effects have been addressed by models with an explicit coarse-grained spatial representation of the polypeptide chain. Sequence–structure mappings based on such models are powerful conceptual tools that rationalize mutational robustness, evolvability, epistasis, promiscuous function performed by ‘hidden’ conformational states, resolution of adaptive conflicts and conformational switches in the evolution from one protein fold to another. Recently, protein biophysics has been applied to derive more accurate evolutionary accounts of sequence data. Methods have also been developed to exploit sequence-based evolutionary information to predict biophysical behaviours of proteins. The success of these approaches demonstrates a deep synergy between the fields of protein biophysics and protein evolution.",adaptation;promiscuous functions;conformational dynamics;hidden states;protein folding;protein–protein interactions

To understand how SFR2 evolved into a transferase, the relationship between its structure and function are investigated by activity assay, molecular modeling, and site-directed mutagenesis. SFR2 has no detectable hydrolase activity, although its catalytic site is highly conserved with that of family 1 glycosyl hydrolases. Three regions disparate from glycosyl hydrolases are identified as required for transferase activity as follows: a loop insertion, the C-terminal peptide, and a hydrophobic patch adjacent to the catalytic site.

However, the determinants and functional implications of EV are only beginning to be investigated. Our analyses based on multiple expression profiles in 41 primary human tissues show that a gene’s EV is significantly correlated with a number of features pertaining to the genomic, epigenomic, regulatory, polymorphic, functional, structural and network characteristics of the gene. We found that (i) EV of a gene is encoded, in part, by its genomic context and is further influenced by the epigenome; (ii) strong promoters induce less variable expression; (iii) less variable gene loci evolve under purifying selection against copy number polymorphisms; (iv) genes that encode inherently disordered or highly interacting proteins exhibit lower variability; and (v) genes with less variable expression are enriched for house-keeping functions, while genes with highly variable expression tend to function in development and extra-cellular response and are associated with human diseases. Thus, our analysis reveals a number of potential mediators as well as functional and evolutionary correlates of EV, and provides new insights into the inherent variability in eukaryotic gene expression.",

Ligand-induced disorder-to-order transition plays a key role in the biological functions of many proteins that contain intrinsically disordered regions. This trait is exhibited by RTX (Repeat in ToXin) motifs found in more than 250 virulence factors secreted by Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. We have investigated several RTX-containing polypeptides of different lengths, all derived from the Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase toxin, CyaA. Using a combination of experimental approaches, we showed that the RTX proteins exhibit the hallmarks of intrinsically disordered proteins in the absence of calcium. This intrinsic disorder mainly results from internal electrostatic repulsions between negatively charged residues of the RTX motifs. Calcium binding triggers a strong reduction of the mean net charge, dehydration and compaction, folding and stabilization of secondary and tertiary structures of the RTX proteins. We propose that the intrinsically disordered character of the RTX proteins may facilitate the uptake and secretion of virulence factors through the bacterial secretion machinery. These results support the hypothesis that the folding reaction is achieved upon protein secretion and, in the case of proteins containing RTX motifs, could be finely regulated by the calcium gradient across bacterial cell wall.",adenylate cyclase CyaA toxin;intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP);natively unfolded proteins;repeat in toxin (RTX);calcium-binding proteins;calcium-induced protein folding

The p15PAF gene is overexpressed in several types of human cancer. The nearly complete NMR backbone assignment of p15PAF allowed us to measure 86 N-HN residual dipolar couplings. Our residual dipolar coupling analysis reveals nonrandom conformational preferences in distinct regions, including the proliferating-cell-nuclear-antigen-interacting protein motif (PIP-box) and the KEN-box (recognized by the ubiquitin ligase that targets p15PAF for degradation). In accordance with these findings, analysis of the 15N R2 relaxation rates shows a relatively reduced mobility for the residues in these regions. The agreement between the experimental small angle x-ray scattering curve of p15PAF and that computed from a statistical coil ensemble corrected for the presence of local secondary structural elements further validates our structural model for p15PAF. The coincidence of these transiently structured regions with protein-protein interaction and posttranslational modification sites suggests a possible role for these structures as molecular recognition elements for p15PAF.",

","The discovery of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins, which contain significant levels of disorder yet perform complex biologically functions, as well as unwanted aggregation, has motivated numerous experimental and theoretical studies aimed at describing residue-level conformational ensembles. Multiple lines of evidence gathered over the last 15 years strongly suggest that amino acids residues display unique and restricted conformational preferences in the unfolded state of peptides and proteins, contrary to one of the basic assumptions of the canonical random coil model. To fully understand residue level order/disorder, however, one has to gain a quantitative, experimentally based picture of conformational distributions and to determine the physical basis underlying residue-level conformational biases. Here, we review the experimental, computational and bioinformatic evidence for conformational preferences of amino acid residues in (mostly short) peptides that can be utilized as suitable model systems for unfolded states of peptides and proteins. In this context particular attention is paid to the alleged high polyproline II preference of alanine. We discuss how these conformational propensities may be modulated by peptide solvent interactions and so called nearest-neighbor interactions. The relevance of conformational propensities for the protein folding problem and the understanding of IDPs is briefly discussed.",unfolded;peptide conformation;pPII;nearest-neighbor;alanine

The protein architecture of dehydrins can be described by the presence of three types of conserved sequence motifs that have been named the K-, Y-, and S-segments. By definition, a dehydrin must contain at least one copy of the lysine-rich K-segment. Abiotic stresses such as drought, cold, and salinity cause the upregulation of dehydrin mRNA and protein levels. Despite the large body of genetic and protein evidence of the importance of these proteins in stress response, the in vivo protective mechanism is not fully known. In vitro experimental evidence from biochemical assays and localization experiments suggests multiple roles for dehydrins, including membrane protection, cryoprotection of enzymes, and protection from reactive oxygen species. Membrane binding by dehydrins is likely to be as a peripheral membrane protein, since the protein sequences are highly hydrophilic and contain many charged amino acids. Because of this, dehydrins in solution are intrinsically disordered proteins, that is, they have no well-defined secondary or tertiary structure. Despite their disorder, dehydrins have been shown to gain structure when bound to ligands such as membranes, and to possibly change their oligomeric state when bound to ions. We review what is currently known about dehydrin sequences and their structures, and examine the various ligands that have been shown to bind to this family of proteins.",abiotic stress;cold;dehydration;dehydrins;intrinsically disordered proteins;late embryogenesis abundant;localization;structure

Human pregnane X receptor, PXR, plays a crucial role in exogenous and endobiotic metabolism for rabbit, rat, mouse, and human. The PXR activation can protect the blood vessels from damage of hazardous substances. In this study we aim to investigate the potent lead compounds as PXR receptor agonist against cardiovascular disease. To improve drug development of TCM compounds, we aim to investigate the potent lead compounds as PXR agonists from the TCM compounds in TCM Database@Taiwan. The top three TCM compounds, bis(4-hydroxybenzyl) ether mono-β-D-glucopyranoside (BEMG), ixerisoside, and tangshenoside II, have displayed higher potent binding affinities than the positive control, PNU-142721, in the docking simulation. After MD simulations, which can optimize the result of docking simulation and validate the stability of H-bonds between each ligand and PXR protein under dynamic conditions, top TCM compounds, BEMG and tangshenoside II, maintain most of interactions with PXR protein, which keep the ligand binding stable in the binding domain. Hence, we propose BEMG and tangshenoside II as potential lead compounds for further study in drug development process with the PXR protein.",

to describe the internal degrees of freedom of each of the 20 amino
acids and their nonbonded interactions with each other; separate sets
of parameters are derived for histidine’s neutral and protonated
forms. In all of the simulations described here each amino acid was
capped with an acetyl (Ace) group at the N-terminus and an N-methyl (Nme) group at the C-terminus in order to mimic
the Cα atoms of adjacent residues that would be present in proteins.
For the derivation of bonded parameters, each capped amino acid was
simulated alone; for the derivation of nonbonded parameters, each
possible pairing of the capped amino acids was simulated: since there
are n(n – 1)/2 heterointeractions
and n homointeractions, where n is
the number of amino acid types, we simulated a total of 231 different
amino acid-pair combinations. All MD simulations were performed using
all-atom models in explicit solvent (see below). In order to test
subsequently the ability of the derived nonbonded CG parameters to
describe associations in more complex systems, additional MD simulations
of systems comprising three or four molecules of alanine, asparagine,
aspartate, cysteine, glycine, lysine, leucine, tryptophan, tyrosine,
and valine were performed. To test the CG parameters at much higher
amino acid concentrations, simulations of alanine, leucine, asparagine,
and tryptophan were also performed at concentrations of 50, 100, 200,

Some of them also accumulate in response to water deficit in vegetative tissues, which leads to a remarkable association between their presence and low water availability conditions. A major sub-group of these proteins, also known as typical LEA proteins, shows high hydrophilicity and a high percentage of glycine and other small amino acid residues, distinctive physicochemical properties that predict a high content of structural disorder. Although all typical LEA proteins share these characteristics, seven groups can be distinguished by sequence similarity, indicating structural and functional diversity among them. Some of these groups have been extensively studied; however, others require a more detailed analysis to advance in their functional understanding. In this work, we report the structural characterization of a group 6 LEA protein from a common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) (PvLEA6) by circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance showing that it is a disordered protein in aqueous solution. Using the same techniques, we show that despite its unstructured nature, the addition of trifluoroethanol exhibited an intrinsic potential in this protein to gain helicity. This property was also promoted by high osmotic potentials or molecular crowding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PvLEA6 protein is able to form soluble homo-oligomeric complexes that also show high levels of structural disorder. The association between PvLEA6 monomers to form dimers was shown to occur in plant cells by bimolecular fluorescence complementation, pointing to the in vivo functional relevance of this association.",Intrinsically Disordered Protein;Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC);Protein Conformation;Protein Self-assembly;Protein Structure;Stress Response;Plant Biology

Recent studies have focused on using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data as input for improved prediction. Here we examine the accuracy of chemical shift prediction for intein systems, which have regions of intrinsic disorder. We find that using MD simulation data as input for chemical shift prediction does not consistently improve prediction accuracy over use of a static X-ray crystal structure. This appears to result from the complex conformational ensemble of the disordered protein segments. We show that using accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) simulations improves chemical shift prediction, suggesting that methods which better sample the conformational ensemble like aMD are more appropriate tools for use in chemical shift prediction for proteins with disordered regions. Moreover, our study suggests that data accurately reflecting protein dynamics must be used as input for chemical shift prediction in order to correctly predict chemical shifts in systems with disorder.",Chemical shift prediction;Molecular dynamics simulation;Accelerated MD;Intein;Partially disordered proteins

The present work aims at the identification and quantification of such overlaps in full proteomes to assess their significance in large-scale studies of protein disorder. It was found that the percentage of cross-predicted residues is around 5% in the human proteome and is generally near that value in other metazoan ones but shows remarkable variation in different organisms.

Hsp70 acts early and Hsp90 late in the folding path, yet the molecular basis of this timing is enigmatic, mainly because the substrate specificity of Hsp90 is poorly understood. Here we obtained a structural model of Hsp90 in complex with its natural disease-associated substrate, the intrinsically disordered Tau protein. Hsp90 binds to a broad region in Tau that includes the aggregation-prone repeats. Complementarily, a 106 Å long substrate-binding interface in Hsp90 enables many low affinity contacts. It allows recognition of scattered hydrophobic residues in late folding intermediates that remain after early burial of the Hsp70 sites. Our model resolves the paradox of how Hsp90 specifically selects for late folding intermediates but also for some intrinsically disordered proteins – through the eyes of Hsp90 they look the same.",molecular chaperones;protein folding;NMR spectroscopy;SAXS;protein-protein interactions;Alzheimer disease;intrinsically disordered proteins

now commercially available (HS-AFM 1.0, RIBM, Tsukuba, Japan), the
sample stage (and not the cantilever tip) is scanned in all three
dimensions (lateral dimensions X, Y and vertical dimension Z), which simplifies the
instrument structure and gives additional stability to the OBD detection.
In HS-AFM imaging of proteins, the Z-scanner is displaced
at 20–100 kHz. This high-frequency displacement produces and
exerts high hydrodynamic pressure, particularly to the cantilever
and its supporting base positioned near the sample stage surface.84 Under such hydrodynamic pressure, the cantilever
and the chip itself tend to move, often deteriorating the dynamic
performance of the cantilever response to relevant tip–sample
interactions.72 In the worst case, the
cantilever response delay becomes longer than the minimized delay
of the feedback loop, meaning that the hydrodynamic perturbation becomes
a major limiting factor for HS-AFM operation. To minimize the hydrodynamic
pressure, the dimensions of the sample stage must be designed as small
as possible, 1–2 mm in diameter.72,84,85 To further circumvent disturbance by hydrodynamic
pressure, the lateral overlap between the sample stage and the cantilever
chip must be minimized, meaning that only objects placed at the peripheral
regions of the sample stage should be imaged.72,85 Moreover, the cantilever tip (tip together with EBD tip) should
be longer than 2.5 μm. When the tip is shorter than this value,
the cantilever gets close to the sample surface in a distance range
where the solution confined between them is significantly “squeezed”
at the bottom of cantilever swing, resulting in oscillation damping
as well as in a blunt change of the oscillation amplitude upon weak
tip–sample interaction. This leads to a drastic deterioration
of the cantilever deflection detection sensitivity during imaging.72,85 Commercially available short cantilevers do not sufficiently consider
the problem raised by hydrodynamic perturbation and the tip length
is only ∼1 μm, highlighting the necessity for EBD tip
growth in laboratories to achieve successful HS-AFM operation.",

MKL1 has three RPEL motifs (RPEL1, RPEL2, and RPEL3) in its N-terminal region. MKL1 binds to monomeric G-actin through RPEL motifs, and the dissociation of MKL1 from G-actin promotes the translocation of MKL1 to the nucleus. Although structural data are available for RPEL motifs of MKL1 in complex with G-actin, the structural characteristics of RPEL motifs in the free state have been poorly defined. Here we characterized the structures of free RPEL motifs using NMR and CD spectroscopy. NMR and CD measurements showed that free RPEL motifs are largely unstructured in solution. However, NMR analysis identified transient α-helices in the regions where helices α1 and α2 are induced upon binding to G-actin. Proline mutagenesis showed that the transient α-helices are locally formed without helix-helix interactions. The helix content is higher in the order of RPEL1, RPEL2, and RPEL3. The amount of preformed structure may correlate with the binding affinity between the intrinsically disordered protein and its target molecule.",

However, 22% of human disease mutations occur in natively unstructured segments of proteins known as intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). This therefore implicates defective IDR functionality in various human diseases including cancer. The functionality of IDRs is partly attributable to short linear motifs (SLiMs), but it remains an open question how much defects in SLiMs contribute to human diseases. A proteome-wide comparison of the distribution of missense mutations from disease and non-disease mutation datasets revealed that, in IDRs, disease mutations are more likely to occur within SLiMs than neutral missense mutations. Moreover, compared to neutral missense mutations, disease mutations more frequently impact functionally important residues of SLiMs, cause changes in the physicochemical properties of SLiMs, and disrupt more SLiM-mediated interactions. Analysis of these mutations resulted in a comprehensive list of experimentally validated or predicted SLiMs disrupted in disease. Furthermore, this in-depth analysis suggests that ‘prostate cancer pathway’ is particularly enriched for proteins with disease-related SLiMs. The contribution of mutations in SLiMs to disease may currently appear small when compared to mutations in globular domains. However, our analysis of mutations in predicted SLiMs suggests that this contribution might be more substantial. Therefore, when analysing the functional impact of mutations on proteins, SLiMs in proteins should not be neglected. Our results suggest that an increased focus on SLiMs in the coming decades will improve our understanding of human diseases and aid in the development of targeted treatments.",

Many proteins identified as being “Intrinsically Disordered Proteins” have a significant amount of their structure that is neither sheet, helix, nor turn; this type of structure is often classified by CD as “other”, “random coil”, “unordered”, or “disordered”. However the “other” category can also include polyproline II (PPII)-type structures, whose spectral properties have not been well-distinguished from those of unordered structures. In this study, synchrotron radiation circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to investigate the spectral properties of collagen and polyproline, which both contain PPII-type structures. Their native spectra were compared as representatives of PPII structures. In addition, their spectra before and after treatment with various conditions to produce unfolded or denatured structures were also compared, with the aim of defining the differences between CD spectra of PPII and disordered structures. We conclude that the spectral features of collagen are more appropriate than those of polyproline for use as the representative spectrum for PPII structures present in typical amino acid-containing proteins, and that the single most characteristic spectroscopic feature distinguishing a PPII structure from a disordered structure is the presence of a positive peak around 220nm in the former but not in the latter. These spectra are now available for inclusion in new reference data sets used for CD analyses of the secondary structures of soluble proteins.",polyproline;collagen;synchrotron radiation circular dichroism spectroscopy;thermal unfolding;intrinsically disordered proteins;secondary structure

Why are certain mRNA transported to a distal location and translated on-site? Here we undertake a systematic, genome-scale study of asymmetrically distributed protein and mRNA in mammalian cells. Our findings suggest that asymmetric-protein distribution by mRNA localization enhances interaction fidelity and signaling sensitivity. Proteins synthesized at distal locations frequently contain intrinsically disordered segments. These regions are generally rich in assembly-promoting modules and are often regulated by post-translational modification sites. Such proteins are tightly regulated but display distinct temporal dynamics upon stimulation with growth factors. Thus proteins synthesized on-site may rapidly alter proteome composition and act as dynamically regulated scaffolds to promote the formation of reversible cellular assemblies. Our observations are consistent across multiple mammalian species, cell types, and developmental stages suggesting that localized translation is a recurring feature of cell signaling and regulation.",

Yet, little is known about the rules that govern protein aggregation in living cells. In this study, we biochemically isolated aggregation-prone proteins and used computational analyses to identify characteristics that are linked to physiological and arsenite-induced aggregation in living yeast cells. High protein abundance, extensive physical interactions, and certain structural properties are positively correlated with an increased aggregation propensity. The aggregated proteins have high translation rates and are substrates of ribosome-associated Hsp70 chaperones, indicating that they are susceptible for aggregation primarily during translation/folding. The aggregation-prone proteins are enriched for multiple chaperone interactions, thus high protein abundance is probably counterbalanced by molecular chaperones to allow soluble expression in vivo. Our data support the notion that arsenite interferes with chaperone activity and indicate that arsenite-aggregated proteins might engage in extensive aberrant protein–protein interactions. Expression of aggregation-prone proteins is down-regulated during arsenite stress, possibly to prevent their toxic accumulation. Several aggregation-prone yeast proteins have human homologues that are implicated in misfolding diseases, suggesting that similar mechanisms may apply in disease- and non-disease settings.",protein aggregation;protein folding;translation;arsenite;chaperone

We show here that HSP27 and αB-crystallin associated with immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domain-containing regions, but not the disordered PEVK domain (titin region rich in proline, glutamate, valine, and lysine), of the titin springs. In sarcomeres, sHSP binding to titin was actin filament independent and promoted by factors that increased titin Ig unfolding, including sarcomere stretch and the expression of stiff titin isoforms. Titin spring elements behaved predominantly as monomers in vitro. However, unfolded Ig segments aggregated, preferentially under acidic conditions, and αB-crystallin prevented this aggregation. Disordered regions did not aggregate. Promoting titin Ig unfolding in cardiomyocytes caused elevated stiffness under acidic stress, but HSP27 or αB-crystallin suppressed this stiffening. In diseased human muscle and heart, both sHSPs associated with the titin springs, in contrast to the cytosolic/Z-disk localization seen in healthy muscle/heart. We conclude that aggregation of unfolded titin Ig domains stiffens myocytes and that sHSPs translocate to these domains to prevent this aggregation.",

Here we applied ESPRIT (expression of soluble proteins by random incremental truncation), an in vitro evolution-like approach, to identify high yielding soluble fragments encompassing conserved regions I and II (CRI and CRII) at the C-terminal region of murine Rif1. NMR analysis showed CRI to be intrinsically disordered, whereas CRII is partially folded. CRII binds cruciform DNA with high selectivity and micromolar affinity and thus represents a functional DNA binding domain. Mutational analysis revealed an α-helical region of CRII to be important for cruciform DNA binding and identified critical residues. Thus, we present the first structural study of the mammalian Rif1, identifying a domain that directly links its function to DNA binding.

Sem1 uses conserved acidic segments separated by a flexible linker to grasp Rpn3 and Rpn7. The same segments are used for protein binding in other complexes, but in the proteasome lid they are uniquely deployed for recognizing separate polypeptides. We engineered TEV protease-cleavage sites into Sem1 to show that the tethering function of Sem1 is important for the biogenesis and integrity of the Rpn3-Sem1-Rpn7 ternary complex but becomes dispensable once the ternary complex incorporates into larger lid precursors.

Their kinase inhibitory activities are mediated by a homologous N-terminal kinase-inhibitory domain (KID). The Cdk inhibitory activity and stability of p27 have been shown to be regulated by a two-step phosphorylation mechanism involving a tyrosine residue within the KID and a threonine residue within the flexible C-terminus. We show that these residues are conserved in p21 and p57, suggesting that a similar phosphorylation cascade regulates these Cdk inhibitors. However, the presence of a cyclin binding motif within its C-terminus alters the regulatory interplay between p21 and Cdk2/cyclin A, and its responses to tyrosine phosphorylation and altered p21:Cdk2/cyclin A stoichiometry. We also show that the Cip/Kip proteins can be phosphorylated in vitro by representatives of many non-receptor tyrosine kinase (NRTK) sub-families, suggesting that NRTKs may generally regulate the activity and stability of these Cdk inhibitors.

In addition to its essential role in protein folding, Grp94 was proposed to participate in the ER associated degradation (ERAD) quality control pathway by interacting with the lectin OS-9, a sensor for terminally misfolded proteins (TMPs). To understand how OS-9 interacts with ER chaperone proteins, we mapped its interaction with Grp94. Glycosylation of the full length Grp94 protein was essential for OS-9 binding, although deletion of the Grp94 N-terminal domain relieved this requirement suggesting that the effect was allosteric rather than direct. Although yeast OS-9 is composed of a well-established N-terminal MRH lectin domain and a C-terminal dimerization domain, we find that the C-terminal domain of OS-9 in higher eukaryotes contains ‘mammalian-specific insets’ that are specifically recognized by the middle and C-terminal domains of Grp94.

In addition to providing predictive quantitative models, MSMs greatly facilitate both the extraction of insight into biomolecular mechanism (such as folding and functional dynamics) and quantitative comparison with single-molecule and ensemble kinetics experiments.

A scheme recently introduced for long-observation-window band-selective homonuclear decoupling in solid state NMR, LOW-BASHD (Struppe et al., J. Magn. Reson. 236, 89–94, 2013) is shown to be effective for 13Cα decoupling during direct 13C′ observation in solution NMR experiments too. For this purpose, adjustment of the decoupling pulse parameters and delays is demonstrated to be important for increasing spectral resolution, to reduce three-spin effects, and to decrease the intensity of decoupling side-bands. LOW-BASHD then yields 13C′ line widths comparable to those obtained with the popular IPAP method, while enhancing sensitivity by ca 35%. As a practical application of LOW-BASHD decoupling, requiring quantitative intensity measurement over a wide dynamic range, the impact of lipid binding on the 13C′-detected NCO spectrum of the intrinsically disordered protein α-synuclein is compared with that on the 1H-detected 1H-15N HSQC spectrum.

It is well known that dehydrins are intrinsically disordered plant proteins that accumulate during the late stages of embryogenesis and in response to abiotic stresses; however, the molecular mechanisms by which their functions are carried out are still unclear. We have previously reported that transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing an Opuntia streptacantha SK3 dehydrin (OpsDHN1) show enhanced tolerance to freezing stress. Herein, we show using a split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid system that OpsDHN1 dimerizes. We found that the deletion of regions containing K-segments and the histidine-rich region in the OpsDHN1 protein affects dimer formation. Not surprisingly, in silico protein sequence analysis suggests that OpsDHN1 is an intrinsically disordered protein, an observation that was confirmed by circular dichroism and gel filtration of the recombinantly expressed protein. The addition of zinc triggered the association of recombinantly expressed OpsDHN1 protein, likely through its histidine-rich motif.

native proteins that are amenable to structural analysis
at atomic resolution, unfolded proteins occupy a manifold of dynamically
interconverting structures. Defining the conformations of unfolded
proteins is of significant interest and importance, for folding studies
and for understanding the properties of intrinsically disordered proteins.
Short chain protein fragments, i.e., oligopeptides, provide an excellent
test-bed in efforts to define the conformational ensemble of unfolded
chains. Oligomers of alanine in particular have been extensively studied
as minimalist models of the intrinsic conformational preferences of
the peptide backbone. Even short alanine peptides occupy an ensemble
of substates that are distinguished by small free energy differences,
so that the problem of quantifying the conformational preferences
of the backbone remains a fundamental challenge in protein biophysics.
Here, we demonstrate an integrated computational-experimental-Bayesian
approach to quantify the conformational ensembles of the model trialanine
peptide in water. In this approach, peptide conformational substates
are first determined objectively by clustering molecular dynamics
snapshots based on both structural and dynamic information. Next,
a set of spectroscopic data for each conformational substate is computed.
Finally, a Bayesian statistical analysis of both experimentally measured
spectroscopic data and computational results is carried out to provide
a current best estimate of the substate population ensemble together
with corresponding confidence intervals. This distribution of substates
can be further systematically refined with additional high-quality
experimental data and more accurate computational modeling. Using
an experimental data set of NMR coupling constants, we have also applied
this approach to characterize the conformation ensemble of trivaline
in water.",

Advances in hardware, sample preparation, experimental methods, and computational approaches now enable structural analysis of protein complexes with increasing complexity that more closely represent biologically entities in the cellular environment. Integrated multidisciplinary approaches are required to overcome limitations of individual methods and take advantage of complementary aspects provided by different structural biology techniques. Although X-ray crystallography remains the method of choice for structural analysis of large complexes, crystallization of flexible systems is often difficult and does typically not provide insights into conformational dynamics present in solution. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is well-suited to study dynamics at picosecond to second time scales, and to map binding interfaces even of large systems at residue resolution but suffers from poor sensitivity with increasing molecular weight. Small angle scattering (SAS) methods provide low resolution information in solution and can characterize dynamics and conformational equilibria complementary to crystallography and NMR. The combination of NMR, crystallography, and SAS is, thus, very useful for analysis of the structure and conformational dynamics of (large) protein complexes in solution. In high molecular weight systems, where NMR data are often sparse, SAS provides additional structural information and can differentiate between NMR-derived models. Scattering data can also validate the solution conformation of a crystal structure and indicate the presence of conformational equilibria. Here, we review current state-of-the-art approaches for combining NMR, crystallography, and SAS data to characterize protein complexes in solution.",nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy;small angle X-ray scattering;small angle neutron scattering;structural biology;multidomain proteins;protein complexes

Sorgen: ude.cmnu@negrosp ;∗Corresponding author ude.cmnu@negrosp","Mechanisms underlying the initiation and persistence of lethal cardiac rhythms are of significant clinical and scientific interests. Gap junctions are principally involved in forming the electrical connections between myocytes, and changes in distribution, density, and properties are consistent characteristics in arrhythmic heart disease. Therefore, understanding the structure and function of gap junctions during normal and abnormal impulse propagation are essential in the control of arrhythmias. For example, Cx45 is predominately expressed in the specialized myocytes of the impulse generation and conduction system. In both ventricular and atrial human working myocytes, Cx45 is present in very low quantities. However, a reduction in Cx43 coupled with an increased Cx45 protein levels within the ventricles have been observed after myocardial infarction and end-stage heart failure. Cx45 may influence electrical and/or metabolic coupling as a result of pathophysiological overexpression. Our goal was to identify mechanisms that could cause cellular coupling to be different between the cardiac connexins. Based upon the conserved transmembrane and extracellular loop segments, our focus was on identifying features within the divergent cytoplasmic portions. Here, we biophysically characterize the carboxyl-terminal domain of Cx45 (Cx45CT). Purification revealed the possibility of oligomeric species, which was confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation experiments. Sedimentation equilibrium and circular dichroism studies of different Cx45CT constructs identified one region of α-helical structure (A333-N361) that mediates CT dimerization through hydrophobic contacts. Interestingly, the binding affinity of Cx45CT dimerization is 1000-fold stronger than Cx43CT dimerization. Cx45CT resonance assignments were also used to identify the binding sites and affinities of molecular partners involved in the Cx45 regulation; although none disrupted dimerization, many of these proteins interacted within one intrinsically disordered region (P278-P285). This domain has similarities with other cardiac connexins, and we propose they constitute a master regulatory domain, which contains overlapping molecular partner binding, cis-trans proline isomerization, and phosphorylation sites.",

One of its regulators is the 64-residue C-terminal Transcriptional Repressor Domain (the TRD) of MBD1, which recruits several repressor proteins such as MCAF1, HDAC3 and MPG that are essential for the gene silencing. Using NMR spectroscopy, we have characterized the solution structure of the C-terminus of MBD1 (MBD1-c, residues D507 to Q605), which included the TRD (A529 to P592). Surprisingly, the MBD1-c is intrinsically disordered. Despite its lack of a tertiary folding, MBD1-c could still bind to different partner proteins in a selective manner. MPG and MCAF1Δ8 showed binding to both the N-terminal and C-terminal residues of MBD1-c but HDAC3 preferably bound to the C-terminal region. This study reveals how MBD1-c discriminates different binding partners, and thus, expands our understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation by MBD1.",

These dynamics manifest in a spectral feature, known as the boson peak (BP), which is common to all disordered materials. We demonstrate that BP position scales systematically with structural motifs, reflecting local rigidity: disordered proteins appear softer than α-helical proteins; which are softer than β-sheet proteins. Our analysis also reveals a universal spectral shape of the BP in proteins and amino acid mixtures; superimposable on the shape observed in typical glasses. Uniformity in the underlying physical mechanism, independent of the specific chemical composition, connects the BP vibrations to nanometer-scale heterogeneities, providing an experimental benchmark for coarse-grained simulations, structure/rigidity relationships, and engineering of proteins for novel applications.",

Kavetsky Institute for Experimental Pathology, Oncology, and Radiobiology; Kiev, Ukraine;2Sequent Development (CRO), LLC; Madison, VA USA;*Correspondence to: Vladimir Vinnitsky, Email: moc.liamg@ykstinnivdalv","To date there is no explanation why the development of almost all types of solid tumors occurs sharing a similar scenario: (1) creation of a cancer stem cell (CSC), (2) CSC multiplication and formation of a multicellular tumor spheroid (TS), (3) vascularization of the TS and its transformation into a vascularized primary tumor, (4) metastatic spreading of CSCs, (5) formation of a metastatic TSs and its transformation into metastatic tumors, and (6) potentially endless repetition of this cycle of events. The above gaps in our knowledge are related to the biology of cancer and specifically to tumorigenesis, which covers the process from the creation of a CSC to the formation of a malignant tumor and the development of metastases. My Oncogerminative Theory of Tumorigenesis considers tumor formation as a dynamic self-organizing process that mimics a self-organizing process of early embryo development. In the initial step in that process, gene mutations combined with epigenetic dysregulation cause somatic cells to be reprogrammed into CSCs, which are immortal pseudo-germline cells. Mimicking the behavior of fertilized germline cells, the CSC achieves immortality by passing through the stages of its life-cycle and developing into a pseudo-blastula-stage embryo, which manifests in the body as a malignant tumor. In this view, the development of a malignant tumor from a CSC is a phenomenon of developmental biology, which we named a desperate asexual self-cloning event. The theory explains seven core characteristics of malignant tumors: (1) CSC immortality, (2) multistep development of a malignant tumor from a single CSC, (3) heterogeneity of malignant tumor cell populations, (4) metastatic spread of CSCs, (5) invasive growth, (6) malignant progression, and (7) selective immune tolerance toward cancer cells.

Nevertheless, its corresponding three-dimensional structure has been difficult to obtain due to the frequent conformational changes observed depending on the microenvironment. Although the function of each helical segment of this protein remains unclear, it has been observed that the apoA-I amino (N) and carboxy-end (C) domains are directly involved in receptor-recognition, processes that determine the diameter for HDL particles. In addition, it has been observed that the high structural plasticity of these segments might be related to several amyloidogenic processes. In this work, we studied a series of peptides derived from the N- and C-terminal domains representing the most hydrophobic segments of apoA-I. Measurements carried out using circular dichroism in all tested peptides evidenced that the lipid environment promotes the formation of α-helical structures, whereas an aqueous environment facilitates a strong tendency to adopt β-sheet/disordered conformations. Electron microscopy observations showed the formation of amyloid-like structures similar to those found in other well-defined amyloidogenic proteins. Interestingly, when the apoA-I peptides were incubated under conditions that promote stable globular structures, two of the peptides studied were cytotoxic to microglia and mouse macrophage cells. Our findings provide an insight into the physicochemical properties of key segments contained in apoA-I which may be implicated in disorder-to-order transitions that in turn maintain the delicate equilibrium between both, native and abnormal conformations, and therefore control its propensity to become involved in pathological processes.",Apolipoprotein A-I;Amyloidogenic peptides;Disorder-to-order transitions

By physically colocalizing sequential steps in a transduction pathway, scaffolds catalyze and direct incoming signals. Much is known about binary interactions with individual domains but it is unknown whether “scaffolding activity” is predictable from pairwise affinities. Here, we characterized multivalent binding to PSD-95, a scaffold protein containing three PDZ domains connected in series by disordered linkers. We used single molecule fluorescence to watch soluble PSD-95 recruit diffusing proteins to a surface-attached receptor cytoplasmic domain. Different ternary complexes showed unique concentration dependence for scaffolding despite similar pairwise affinity. The concentration dependence of scaffolding activity was not predictable based on binary interactions. PSD-95 did not stabilize specific complexes, but rather increased the frequency of transient binding events. Our results suggest that PSD-95 maintains a loosely-connected pleomorphic ensemble rather than forming a stereospecific complex containing all components.",

It does so primarily via a central proline-rich SH3 (Src homology 3) ligand (T92–R104, murine 18.5 kDa MBP sequence numbering) that is part of a molecular switch due to its high degree of conservation and modification by MAP (mitogen-activated protein) and other kinases, especially at residues T92 and T95.

This mini-review discusses what is known about the phosphorylation events taking place on the SFK Unique domains, and their biological relevance. The modulation by phosphorylation of biologically relevant inter- and intra- molecular interactions of Src, as well as the existence of complex phosphorylation/dephosphorylation patterns observed for the Unique domain of Src, reinforces the important functional role of the Unique domain in the regulation mechanisms of the Src kinases and, in a wider context, of intrinsically disordered regions in cellular processes.",IDPs;IDRs;phosphorylation;unique domain;SFKs;Src

Through comprehensive phylogenetic analyses, we systematically traced the evolution of vertebrate p53 family oligomerization domains back to the beginning of multicellular life. We provide evidence that their last common ancestor also had an extended p63/p73-like domain and pinpoint evolutionary events that shaped this domain during vertebrate radiation.

As evidence, the paper will discuss previous simulation work on the superior fold evolvability of oily peptides, trace (“fossil”) evidence within proteomes seen today, and a general relationship between protein dynamism and evolvability. Aside from implications on the origination of protein folds, the hypothesis implies that the vanishing utility of a random peptide in protein origination may be relatively exaggerated, as some random peptides with a certain composition (e.g., oily) may fare better than others. In later sections, the hypothesis is discussed in the context of existing discussions regarding the spontaneous origination of biomolecules.",pluripotent hypothesis;protein fold invention;oily peptides;origins of life

In vitro studies suggest that these proteins can protect other macromolecules and cellular structural components from the impairments caused by water limitation. Their binding to phospholipids, nucleic acids and/or to divalent cations has suggested multi-functionality. Genetic analyses indicate that these proteins are required for an optimal adjustment of plants to this insult. This diverse information has conducted to propose different models for LEA proteins action mechanisms. Many of these properties are shared by group 2 LEA proteins or dehydrins (DHNs), one of the LEA protein families for which large amount of data is available. This manuscript focuses on the different mechanisms proposed for this LEA protein group by analyzing published data derived from in vitro cryoprotection assays. We compared the molar ratio of protectant:enzyme needed to preserve 50% of the initial activity per enzyme monomer to assess different mechanisms of action. Our results add evidence for protein–protein interaction as a protection mechanism but also indicate that some DHNs might protect by different means. The strength and weakness of the proposed protection mechanisms are discussed.",dehydrins;late embryogenesis abundant proteins;cryoprotection;water deficit;abiotic stress;intrinsically disordered proteins

One of the protein network properties most influenced by the structural contents of its nodes is the inter-connectivity. Recent studies in which structural information was included into the topological analysis of protein networks revealed that the content of intrinsic disorder in the nodes could modulate the network topology, rewire networks, and change their inter-connectivity, which is defined by its clustering coefficient. Here, we review the role of intrinsic disorder present in the partners of the highly conserved 14-3-3 protein family on its interaction networks. The 14-3-3s are phospho-serine/threonine binding proteins that have strong influence in the regulation of metabolism and signal transduction networks. Intrinsic disorder increases the clustering coefficients, namely the inter-connectivity of the nodes within each 14-3-3 paralog networks. We also review two new ideas to measure intrinsic disorder independently of the primary sequence of proteins, a thermodynamic model and a method that uses protein structures and their solvent environment. This new methods could be useful to explain unsolved questions about versatility and fixation of intrinsic disorder through evolution. The relation between the intrinsic disorder and network topologies could be an interesting model to investigate new implicitness of the graph theory into biology.",protein intrinsic disorder;protein interaction networks;14-3-3 protein family;protein phosphorylation;post-translational modifications

However, it is now becoming clear that proteins can also be targeted for degradation by the core 20S proteasome itself. Degradation by the 20S proteasome does not require ubiquitin tagging or the presence of the 19S regulatory particle; rather, it relies on the inherent structural disorder of the protein being degraded. Thus, proteins that contain unstructured regions due to oxidation, mutation, or aging, as well as naturally, intrinsically unfolded proteins, are susceptible to 20S degradation. Unlike the extensive knowledge acquired over the years concerning degradation by the 26S proteasome, relatively little is known about the means by which 20S-mediated proteolysis is controlled. Here, we describe our current understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that coordinate 20S proteasome-mediated degradation, and highlight the gaps in knowledge that remain to be bridged.",protein degradation;20S proteasome;intrinsically disordered proteins;oxidatively damaged proteins;regulatory mechanisms

New structures of the proteasome particle show how its subunits are arranged and provide insights into how the proteasome is regulated. Proteins are targeted to the proteasome by tags composed of several ubiquitin moieties. The structure of the tags tunes the order in which proteins are degraded. The proteasome itself edits the ubiquitin tags and drugs that interfere in this process can enhance the clearance of toxic proteins from cells.

Kolbe 4, Udine 33100, Italy, E-mail:Email: ti.duinu@llet.aculnaig","Significance: An emerging concept in DNA repair mechanisms is the evidence that some key enzymes, besides their role in the maintenance of genome stability, display also unexpected noncanonical functions associated with RNA metabolism in specific subcellular districts (e.g., nucleoli). During the evolution of these key enzymes, the acquisition of unfolded domains significantly amplified the possibility to interact with different partners and substrates, possibly explaining their phylogenetic gain of functions. Recent Advances: After nucleolar stress or DNA damage, many DNA repair proteins can freely relocalize from nucleoli to the nucleoplasm. This process may represent a surveillance mechanism to monitor the synthesis and correct assembly of ribosomal units affecting cell cycle progression or inducing p53-mediated apoptosis or senescence. Critical Issues: A paradigm for this kind of regulation is represented by some enzymes of the DNA base excision repair (BER) pathway, such as apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1). In this review, the role of the nucleolus and the noncanonical functions of the APE1 protein are discussed in light of their possible implications in human pathologies. Future Directions: A productive cross-talk between DNA repair enzymes and proteins involved in RNA metabolism seems reasonable as the nucleolus is emerging as a dynamic functional hub that coordinates cell growth arrest and DNA repair mechanisms. These findings will drive further analyses on other BER proteins and might imply that nucleic acid processing enzymes are more versatile than originally thought having evolved DNA-targeted functions after a previous life in the early RNA world.

Nevertheless, the relationship of sequence to function for protein segments that undergo coupled binding and folding remains to be determined. Specifically, it is not known if the well-established rules that govern protein folding and stability are relevant to ligand-linked folding transitions. Upon small ligand biotinoyl-5′-AMP (bio-5′-AMP) binding the Escherichia coli protein BirA undergoes a disorder-to-order transition that results in formation of a network of packed hydrophobic side chains. Ligand binding is also allosterically coupled to protein association, with bio-5′-AMP binding enhancing the dimerization free energy by −4.0 kcal/mol. Previous studies indicated that single alanine replacements in a three residue hydrophobic cluster that contributes to the larger network disrupt cluster formation, ligand binding, and allosteric activation of protein association. In this work, combined equilibrium and kinetic measurements of BirA variants with alanine substitutions in the entire hydrophobic network reveal large functional perturbations resulting from any single substitution and highly non-additive effects of multiple substitutions. These substitutions also disrupt ligand-linked folding. The combined results suggest that, analogous to protein folding, functional disorder-to-order linked to binding requires optimal packing of the relevant hydrophobic side chains that contribute to the transition.

The regulation of RNA granule assembly and disassembly is a structural basis of translational control, and its disorder is implicated in degenerative disease. Here, we used proteomic analysis to identify proteins associated with RNA granule protein 105 (RNG105)/caprin1, an RNA-binding protein in RNA granules. Among the identified proteins, we focused on nuclear factor (NF) 45 and its binding partner, nuclear factor associated with dsRNA 2 (NFAR2), and we demonstrated that NF45 promotes disassembly of RNA granules, whereas NFAR2 enhances the assembly of RNA granules in cultured cells. The GQSY domain of NFAR2 was required to associate with messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes containing RNG105/caprin1, and it was structurally and functionally related to the low complexity sequence domain of the fused in sarcoma protein, which drives the assembly of RNA granules. Another domain of NFAR2, the DZF domain, was dispensable for association with the RNG105 complex, but it was involved in positive and negative regulation of RNA granule assembly by being phosphorylated at double-stranded RNA-activated kinase sites and by association with NF45, respectively. These results suggest a novel molecular mechanism for the modulation of RNA granule assembly and disassembly by NFAR2, NF45, and phosphorylation at double-stranded RNA-activated kinase PKR sites.",Protein Assembly;Protein Domain;Protein Kinase RNA-activated (PKR);Proteomics;Ribonuclear Protein (RNP);Low Complexity Sequence Domain;NF45;NFAR2/NF110;RNA Granule;RNG105/caprin1

They can bind to multiple molecular partners and integrate diverse types of cellular information. When imaged by time-lapse microscopy, many signaling proteins show complex patterns of activity or localization that vary from cell to cell. This heterogeneity is so prevalent that it has spurred the development of new computational strategies to analyze single-cell signaling patterns. A collective observation from these analyses is that cells appear less heterogeneous when their responses are normalized to, or synchronized with, other single-cell measurements. In many cases, these transformed signaling patterns show distinct dynamical trends that correspond with predictable phenotypic outcomes. When signaling mechanisms are unclear, computational models can suggest putative molecular interactions that are experimentally testable. Thus, computational analysis of single-cell signaling has not only provided new ways to quantify the responses of individual cells, but has helped resolve longstanding questions surrounding many well-studied human signaling proteins including NF-κB, p53, ERK1/2, and CDK2. A number of specific challenges lie ahead for single-cell analysis such as quantifying the contribution of non-cell autonomous signaling as well as the characterization of protein signaling dynamics in vivo.",cell signaling;single-cell analysis;computational modeling;time-lapse microscopy;NF-κB;p53;ERK1/2;CDK2

In addition, divergent evolutionary processes are apparently facilitated by random mutations that yield promiscuous enzyme intermediates. The intermediates, in turn, provide opportunities for further evolution to optimize new functions from existing protein scaffolds. In some cases, promiscuity may simply represent the inherent plasticity of proteins resulting from their polymeric nature with distributed conformational ensembles. Enzymes or proteins that bind or metabolize noncognate substrates create ‘messiness’ or noise in the systems they contribute to. With our increasing awareness of the frequency of these promiscuous behaviors it becomes interesting and important to understand the molecular bases for promiscuous behavior and to distinguish between evolutionarily selected promiscuity and evolutionarily tolerated messiness. This review provides an overview of current understanding of these aspects of protein biochemistry and enzymology.",Enzyme promiscuity;Detoxication enzymes;Enzyme evolution;Evolvability;Intrinsically Disordered proteins

We selected the ff99sb-ildn-NMR32 variant of the original Amber ff99 force filed33 with improved the φ/ψ dihedral 32,34,35 and side chain torsion potentials for Ile, Leu, Asp, and Asn residues.35 This force field scored high when tested against a suite of 524 chemical shift and J coupling ((3)JH(N)H(α), (3)JH(N)C(/β), (3)JH(α)C′, (3)JH(N)C′, and (3)JH(α)N) measurements on dipeptides, tripeptides, tetra-alanine, and ubiquitin. The lowest-energy conformation from the family of NMR structures (PDB ID: 2LM3)14 was used as the starting structure for the simulation. The 205-residue protein contains 3206 atoms. The protein was immersed into a triclinic box with a minimal distance of 1 nm to box wall. Initially, 500 steps of steepest descent energy minimization were conducted to remove steric clashes. The box was filled with 8291 SPC water molecules and 26 pairs of Na+ and Cl− ions to mimic physiological conditions. The resulting system of 28 131 atoms was energetically minimized for additional 500 steps. The system's temperature was then gradually raised to 300 K using 1 K per 1 ps step. Solvent was equilibrated in a 5 ns molecular dynamics calculation with the protein-heavy atoms harmonically restrained to their positions in NPT ensemble. Pressure of 1 atm was controlled with Parinello-Rahman algorithm and temperature kept fixed with v-rescale. The PME method was used to treat electrostatics beyond the cutoff of 0.9 nm, and grid spacing of 0.16 nm was applied. For van der Waals interactions the same 0.9 nm cutoff was applied and the neighbor list was updated every 5 steps. The stochastic integrator with a 2 fs time step was used in all MD calculation. The resulting SPRY conformation was used as input for both, the conventional and replica exchange MD. Conventional molecular dynamics simulations were performed as 10 independent trajectories of 100 ns each and snapshots were saved every 2 ps. For the replica exchange calculation we selected a temperature window of 200 K. T-REMD server37 was used to generate the temperature distribution of the 100 replica within the 300-501.18 K temperature window. Exchange probability was set to 0.25 and exchange attempts were made every 1000 steps (2 ps). Trajectories of 100 ns were calculated for each of the 100 replicas, totaling in 10 μs of the cumulative REMD trajectory.",

This coupled study of fast folding proteins has provided insight into the mechanisms which allow some proteins to find their native conformation well less than 1 ms and has uncovered examples of theoretically predicted phenomena such as downhill folding. The study of fast folders also informs our understanding of even “slow” folding processes: fast folders are small, relatively simple protein domains and the principles that govern their folding also govern the folding of more complex systems. This review summarizes the major theoretical and experimental techniques used to study fast folding proteins and provides an overview of the major findings of fast folding research. Finally, we examine the themes that have emerged from studying fast folders and briefly summarize their application to protein folding in general as well as some work that is left to do.",

Through its interaction with other proteins and mineral, amelogenin assists enamel biomineralization by controlling the formation of highly organized enamel crystal arrays. We used circular dichroism (CD), dynamic light scattering (DLS), fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy to investigate the folding propensity of recombinant porcine amelogenin rP172 following its interaction with SDS, at levels above critical micelle concentration. The rP172-SDS complex formation was confirmed by DLS, while an increase in the structure moiety of rP172 was noted through CD and fluorescence experiments. Fluorescence quenching analyses performed on several rP172 mutants where all but one Trp was replaced by Tyr at different sequence regions confirmed that the interaction of amelogenin with SDS micelles occurs via the N-terminal region close to Trp25 where helical segments can be detected by NMR. NMR spectroscopy and structural refinement calculations using CS-Rosetta modelling confirm that the highly conserved N-terminal domain is prone to form helical structure when bound to SDS micelles. Our findings reported here reveal interactions leading to significant changes in the secondary structure of rP172 upon treatment with SDS.

Both these ligands are unstructured in isolation and fold only upon binding, posing the KIX domain as an ideal candidate to explore the binding induced folding reaction of intrinsically unstructured proteins. Here, we complement the recent kinetic description on the interaction between KIX and c-Myb, by characterizing the binding kinetics between KIX and MLL, at different pH and ionic strength conditions.

Equipped with the ability to record distribution of behaviors rather than the mean property of a population, single molecule measurements offer observation and quantification of the abundance, lifetime and function of multiple protein states. They also permit the direct observation of the transient and rarely populated intermediates in the energy landscape that are typically averaged out in non-synchronized ensemble measurements. Single molecule studies have thus provided novel insights about how the dynamic sampling of the free energy landscape dictates all aspects of protein behavior; from its folding to function.

We will discuss a few selected examples highlighting the power of the emerging techniques and finally discuss the future improvements and directions.",single molecules;conformational dynamics;single molecule FRET;free energy landscape;protein folding;allosteric regulation

A common metric to distinguish these processes is the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (i.e., dN/dS) interpreted from the neutral theory as a null model. However, from biophysical considerations, mutations have non-negligible effects on the biophysical properties of proteins such as folding stability. In this work, we investigated how stability affects the rate of protein evolution in phylogenetic trees by using simulations that combine explicit protein sequences with associated stability changes. We first simulated myoglobin evolution in phylogenetic trees with a biophysically realistic approach that accounts for 3D structural information and estimates of changes in stability upon mutation. We then compared evolutionary rates inferred directly from simulation to those estimated using maximum-likelihood (ML) methods. We found that the dN/dS estimated by ML methods (ωML) is highly predictive of the per gene dN/dS inferred from the simulated phylogenetic trees. This agreement is strong in the regime of high stability where protein evolution is neutral. At low folding stabilities and under mutation-selection balance, we observe deviations from neutrality (per gene dN/dS > 1 and dN/dS < 1). We showed that although per gene dN/dS is robust to these deviations, ML tests for positive selection detect statistically significant per site dN/dS > 1. Altogether, we show how protein biophysics affects the dN/dS estimations and its subsequent interpretation. These results are important for improving the current approaches for detecting positive selection.",dN/dS;molecular evolution;protein evolution;folding stability;positive selection;maximum likelihood

Current FG-centric views reason that selective Kap translocation is promoted by alterations in the barrier-like FG Nup conformations. However, the strong binding of Kaps with the FG Nups due to avidity contradicts rapid Kap translocation in vivo. Here, using surface plasmon resonance, we innovate a means to correlate in situ mechanistic (molecular occupancy and conformational changes) with equilibrium (binding affinity) and kinetic (multivalent binding kinetics) aspects of Karyopherinβ1 (Kapβ1) binding to four different FG Nups. A general feature of the FxFG domains of Nup214, Nup62, and Nup153 is their capacity to extend and accommodate large numbers of Kapβ1 molecules at physiological Kapβ1 concentrations. A notable exception is the GLFG domain of Nup98, which forms a partially penetrable cohesive layer. Interestingly, we find that a slowly exchanging Kapβ1 phase forms an integral constituent within the FG Nups that coexists with a fast phase, which dominates transport kinetics due to limited binding with the pre-occupied FG Nups at physiological Kapβ1 concentrations. Altogether, our data reveal an emergent Kap-centric barrier mechanism that may underlie mechanistic and kinetic control in the nuclear pore complex.",

MTA1 consists of four characterised domains, a number of interaction motifs, and regions that are predicted to be intrinsically disordered. The ELM2-SANT domain is one of the best-characterised regions of MTA1, which recruits histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and activates the enzyme in the presence of inositol phosphate. MTA1 is highly upregulated in several types of aggressive tumours and is therefore a possible target for cancer therapy.

Research on Arabidopsis has resulted in the generation of high-quality genome sequences, annotations and related post-genomic studies. The amount of annotation, such as gene-coding regions and structures, is steadily growing in the field of plant research. In contrast to the genomics resource of animals and microorganisms, there are still some difficulties with characterization of some gene functions in plant genomics studies. The acquisition of information on protein structure can help elucidate the corresponding gene function because proteins encoded in the genome possess highly specific structures and functions. In this study, we calculated multiple physicochemical and secondary structural parameters of protein sequences, including length, hydrophobicity, the amount of secondary structure, the number of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and the predicted presence of transmembrane helices and signal peptides, using a total of 208,333 protein sequences from the genomes of six representative plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana, Glycine max (soybean), Populus trichocarpa (poplar), Oryza sativa (rice), Physcomitrella patens (moss) and Cyanidioschyzon merolae (alga).

Embryos lacking group 1 LEA proteins showed significantly lower survival than control embryos after desiccation and freezing, or freezing alone, demonstrating a role for group 1 LEA proteins in A. franciscana tolerance of low water conditions. In contrast, regardless of group 1 LEA protein presence, cysts responded similarly to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) exposure, indicating little to no function for these proteins in diapause termination. This is the first in vivo study of group 1 LEA proteins in an animal and it contributes to the fundamental understanding of these proteins.

Leashin (LAH) is a large Woronin body tethering protein that contains highly conserved N- and C-terminal regions and a long (∼2,500-amino-acid) nonconserved middle region. As the involvement of the nonconserved region in Woronin body function has not been investigated, here, we functionally characterized individual regions of the LAH protein of Aspergillus oryzae (AoLAH). In an Aolah disruptant, no Woronin bodies were tethered to the septum, and hyphae had a reduced ability to prevent excessive cytoplasmic loss upon hyphal wounding. Localization analysis revealed that the N-terminal region of AoLAH associated with Woronin bodies dependently on AoWSC, which is homologous to Neurospora crassa WSC (Woronin body sorting complex), and that the C-terminal region was localized to the septum. Elastic movement of Woronin bodies was observed when visualized with an AoLAH N-terminal-region–enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion protein. An N- and C-terminal fusion construct lacking the nonconserved middle region of AoLAH was sufficient for the tethering of Woronin bodies to the septum. However, Woronin bodies were located closer to the septum and exhibited impaired elastic movement. Moreover, expression of middle-region-deleted AoLAH in the Aolah disruptant did not restore the ability to prevent excessive cytoplasmic loss. These findings indicate that the nonconserved middle region of AoLAH has functional importance for regulating the position, movement, and function of Woronin bodies.",

Most of these inanimate systems are polymers that compute their own structures and dynamics using as input seemingly random character strings of their sequence, following which they coalesce and perform integrated cellular functions. In large computational systems with a finite interaction-codes, the appearance of conflicting goals is inevitable. Simple conflicting forces can lead to quite complex structures and behaviors, leading to the concept of frustration in condensed matter. We present here some basic ideas about frustration in biomolecules and how the frustration concept leads to a better appreciation of many aspects of the architecture of biomolecules, and how biomolecular structure connects to function. These ideas are simultaneously both seductively simple and perilously subtle to grasp completely. The energy landscape theory of protein folding provides a framework for quantifying frustration in large systems and has been implemented at many levels of description. We first review the notion of frustration from the areas of abstract logic and its uses in simple condensed matter systems. We discuss then how the frustration concept applies specifically to heteropolymers, testing folding landscape theory in computer simulations of protein models and in experimentally accessible systems. Studying the aspects of frustration averaged over many proteins provides ways to infer energy functions useful for reliable structure prediction. We discuss how frustration affects folding mechanisms. We review here how a large part of the biological functions of proteins are related to subtle local physical frustration effects and how frustration influences the appearance of metastable states, the nature of binding processes, catalysis and allosteric transitions. We hope to illustrate how Frustration is a fundamental concept in relating function to structural biology.",

In multicellular fungi, cells are connected directly via intercellular bridges called septal pores. Using Aspergillus nidulans, we demonstrate for the first time that septal pores are regulated to be opened during interphase but closed during mitosis. Septal pore–associated proteins display dynamic cell cycle–regulated locations at mature septa. Of importance, the mitotic NIMA kinase locates to forming septa and surprisingly then remains at septa throughout interphase. However, during mitosis, when NIMA transiently locates to nuclei to promote mitosis, its levels at septa drop. A model is proposed in which NIMA helps keep septal pores open during interphase and then closed when it is removed from them during mitosis. In support of this hypothesis, NIMA inactivation is shown to promote interphase septal pore closing. Because NIMA triggers nuclear pore complex opening during mitosis, our findings suggest that common cell cycle regulatory mechanisms might control septal pores and nuclear pores such that they are opened and closed out of phase to each other during cell cycle progression.

from a transcription-based
feedback loop driven by a set of dedicated clock proteins. At its
core, the heterodimeric transcription factor CLOCK:BMAL1 activates
expression of Period, Cryptochrome, and Rev-Erb genes, which feed back to repress
transcription and create oscillations in gene expression that confer
circadian timing cues to cellular processes. The formation of different
clock protein complexes throughout this transcriptional cycle helps
to establish the intrinsic ∼24 h periodicity of the clock;
however, current models of circadian timekeeping lack the explanatory
power to fully describe this process. Recent studies confirm the presence
of at least three distinct regulatory complexes: a transcriptionally
active state comprising the CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimer with its coactivator
CBP/p300, an early repressive state containing PER:CRY complexes,
and a late repressive state marked by a poised but inactive, DNA-bound
CLOCK:BMAL1:CRY1 complex. In this review, we analyze high-resolution
structures of core circadian transcriptional regulators and integrate
biochemical data to suggest how remodeling of clock protein complexes
may be achieved throughout the 24 h cycle. Defining these detailed
mechanisms will provide a foundation for understanding the molecular
basis of circadian timing and help to establish new platforms for

Using a statistical genomics approach, we identify a large number of potentially functional ELMs and observe that the occurrence of ELMs is often evolutionarily conserved but not uniform across virus families. Some viral proteins contain multiple types of ELMs, in striking similarity to complex regulatory modules in host proteins, suggesting that ELMs may act combinatorially to assist viral replication. Furthermore, a simple evolutionary model suggests that the inherent structural simplicity of ELMs often enables them to tolerate mutations and evolve quickly. Our findings suggest that ELMs may allow fast rewiring of host-virus interactions, which likely assists rapid viral evolution and adaptation to diverse environments.",

","Recombinant antigenic proteins of Toxoplasma gondii are alternative source of antigens which are easily obtainable for serodiagnosis of toxoplasmosis. In this study, highly antigenic secretory organellar proteins, dense granular GRA2 and GRA3, rhoptrial ROP2, and micronemal MIC2, were analyzed by bioinformatics approach to express as water-soluble forms of antigenic domains. The transmembrane region and disorder tendency of 4 secretory proteins were predicted to clone the genes into pGEX-4T-1 vector. Recombinant plasmids were transformed into BL21 (DE3) pLysS E. coli, and GST fusion proteins were expressed with IPTG. As a result, GST fusion proteins with GRA225-105, GRA339-138, ROP2324-561, and MIC21-284 domains had respectively higher value of IgG avidity. The rGST-GRA225-105 and rGST-GRA339-138 were soluble, while rGST-ROP2324-561 and rGST-MIC21-284 were not. GRA231-71, intrinsically unstructured domain (IUD) of GRA2, was used as a linker to enhance the solubility. The rGST-GRA231-71-ROP2324-561, a chimeric protein, appeared to be soluble. Moreover, rGST-GRA231-71-MIC21-284 was also soluble and had higher IgG avidity comparing to rGST-MIC21-284. These 4 highly expressed and water-soluble recombinant antigenic proteins may be promising candidates to improve the serodiagnosis of toxoplasmosis in addition to the major surface antigen of SAG1.",Toxoplasma gondii;bioinformatics;intrinsically unstructured domain;GRA2;GRA3;ROP2;MIC2;antigenic domain;IgG avidity

are frequently used as cosolvents to enhance structure
formation in peptides and proteins. In particular, TFE is remarkably
effective in this regard and thus has found broad application. While
previous studies have provided many insights into how TFE acts to
achieve its structure-enhancing role, the potential effect of TFE
clustering, which is maximized at approximately 30% TFE (v/v), has
often been overlooked. To investigate whether TFE clusters affect
the folding kinetics of proteins, herein we study the conformational
relaxation kinetics of two intrinsically disorder proteins: one (i.e.,
pKID) forms a HTH conformation and the other (i.e., LEA) folds into
an α-helix when TFE is present. Our results show that the relaxation
rate of pKID has a complex dependence on TFE percentage in the range
of 0–50%, whereas that of LEA is insensitive to TFE concentration.
In particular, the maximum relaxation rate of pKID occurs at a TFE
percentage (15–30%) where TFE clustering is also prevalent.
Thus, based on these results, we propose that TFE can act as a nanocrowder
and, through the excluded volume effect, increase the folding rate
of proteins containing a substantial amount of nonlocal contacts.",

It is suggested that proteins Intrinsically Disordered regions (IDR) are to play a role in GPCR’s intra and extracellular regions plasticity, due to their potential for post-translational modification and interaction with other proteins. These regions are defined as lacking a stable three-dimensional (3D) structure. They are rich in hydrophilic and charged, amino acids and are capable to assume different conformation which allows them to interact with multiple partners. In this study we analyzed 75 GPCR involved in synaptic transmission using computational tools for sequence based prediction of intrinsically disordered regions within a protein. We also evaluated putative ligand binding motifs using receptor sequences. The disorder analysis indicated that neurotransmitter GPCRs have a significant amount of disorder in their N-terminus, third Intracellular loop (3IL) and C-terminus. About 31, 39 and 53% of human GPCR involved in synaptic transmission are disordered in these regions. Thirty-three percent of receptors show at least one predicted PEST motif, this being statistically greater than the estimate for the rest of human GPCRs. About 90% of the receptors had at least one putative site for dimerization in their 3IL or C-terminus. The ELM instance sampled in these domains were 14-3-3, SH3, SH2 and PDZ motifs. In conclusion, the increased flexibility observed in GPCRs, added to the enrichment of linear motifs, PEST and heteromerization sites, may be critical for the nervous system’s functional plasticity.",GPCR;Disordered proteins;Pest motifs;Noncovalent interactions;linear motifs

The underlying molecular mechanisms of this gene-by-environment interaction are not well understood, but epigenetic regulation including differential DNA methylation has been postulated to have a critical role. Recently, we used a maternal restraint stress paradigm of prenatal stress (PS) in 5-HTT-deficient mice and showed that the effects on behavior and gene expression were particularly marked in the hippocampus of female 5-Htt+/− offspring. Here, we examined to which extent these effects are mediated by differential methylation of DNA. For this purpose, we performed a genome-wide hippocampal DNA methylation screening using methylated-DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) on Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Promoter 1.0 R arrays. Using hippocampal DNA from the same mice as assessed before enabled us to correlate gene-specific DNA methylation, mRNA expression and behavior. We found that 5-Htt genotype, PS and their interaction differentially affected the DNA methylation signature of numerous genes, a subset of which showed overlap with the expression profiles of the corresponding transcripts. For example, a differentially methylated region in the gene encoding myelin basic protein (Mbp) was associated with its expression in a 5-Htt-, PS- and 5-Htt × PS-dependent manner. Subsequent fine-mapping of this Mbp locus linked the methylation status of two specific CpG sites to Mbp expression and anxiety-related behavior. In conclusion, hippocampal DNA methylation patterns and expression profiles of female prenatally stressed 5-Htt+/− mice suggest that distinct molecular mechanisms, some of which are promoter methylation-dependent, contribute to the behavioral effects of the 5-Htt genotype, PS exposure and their interaction.",

Here, we describe the application of a combination of standard 3D heteronuclear methods with CC(CO)NH and a variety of MUltiplicity Selective In-phase Coherence transfer (MUSIC) experiments. Both CC(CO)NH and MUSIC are, in theory, very powerful methods for the backbone assignment of proteins. Due to low sensitivity, their use has usually been linked to small proteins only. However, we found that combining CC(CO)NH and MUSIC experiments simplified the assignment of two challenging medium-sized proteins of 13 and 19.5 kDa, respectively. These methods are to some extent complementary to each other: CC(CO)NH acquired with a long isotropic mixing time can identify amino acids with large aliphatic side chains. Whereas the most sensitive MUSIC experiments identify amino acid types that cannot be detected by CC(CO)NH, comprising the residues with acid and amide groups, and aromatic rings in their side chains. Together these methods provide a means of identifying the majority of peaks in the 2D 15N HSQC spectrum which simplifies the backbone assignment work even for proteins, e.g., small kinases, whose standard spectra resulted in little spectral resolution and low signal intensities.",protein NMR spectroscopy;backbone assignment;CC(CO)NH;MUSIC

In eukaryotes, a significant number of conserved r-proteins have evolved extra amino- or carboxy-terminal tail sequences, which thread across the solvent-exposed surface. The biological importance of these extended domains remains to be established. In this study, we have investigated the universally conserved internal loop and the eukaryote-specific extensions of yeast L4. We show that in contrast to findings with bacterial L4, deleting the internal loop of yeast L4 causes severely impaired growth and reduced levels of large ribosomal subunits. We further report that while depleting the entire L4 protein blocks early assembly steps in yeast, deletion of only its extended internal loop affects later steps in assembly, revealing a second role for L4 during ribosome biogenesis. Surprisingly, deletion of the entire eukaryote-specific carboxy-terminal tail of L4 has no effect on viability, production of 60S subunits, or translation. These unexpected observations provide impetus to further investigate the functions of ribosomal protein extensions, especially eukaryote-specific examples, in ribosome assembly and function.",ribosome;ribosome assembly;ribosomal protein L4;ribosomal protein extensions

If yeast cells do not proliferate and transit to quiescence, metabolic changes result in the dissociation of proteasomes into proteolytic core and regulatory complexes and their sequestration into motile cytosolic proteasome storage granuli. These granuli rapidly clear with the resumption of growth, releasing the stored proteasomes, which relocalize back to the nucleus to promote cell cycle progression. Here, I report on three models of how proteasomes are transported from the cytoplasm into the nucleus of yeast cells. The first model applies for dividing yeast and is based on the canonical pathway using classical nuclear localization sequences of proteasomal subcomplexes and the classical import receptor importin/karyopherin αβ. The second model applies for quiescent yeast cells, which resume growth and use Blm10, a HEAT-like repeat protein structurally related to karyopherin β, for nuclear import of proteasome core particles. In the third model, the fully-assembled proteasome is imported into the nucleus. Our still marginal knowledge about proteasome dynamics will inspire the discussion on how protein degradation by proteasomes may be regulated in different cellular compartments of dividing and quiescent eukaryotic cells.",proteasome;nuclear transport;protein degradation

It has been suggested that intrinsic disorder of the N-terminal arm (NTA) of sHSPs is important for substrate recognition. To investigate conformations of the NTA that could recognize substrates we performed replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations. Behavior at normal and stress temperatures of the dimeric building blocks of dodecameric HSPs from wheat (Ta16.9) and pea (Ps18.1) were compared because they display high sequence similarity, but Ps18.1 is more efficient in binding specific substrates. In our simulations, the NTAs of the dimer are flexible and dynamic; however, rather than exhibiting highly extended conformations they retain considerable α-helical character and contacts with the conserved α-crystallin domain (ACD). Network analysis and clustering methods reveal that there are two major conformational forms designated either “open” or “closed” based on the relative position of the two NTAs and their hydrophobic solvent accessible surface area. The equilibrium constant for the closed to open transition is significantly different for Ta16.9 and Ps18.1, with the latter showing more open conformations at elevated temperature correlated with its more effective chaperone activity. In addition, the Ps18.1 NTAs have more hydrophobic solvent accessible surface than those of Ta16.9. NTA hydrophobic patches are comparable in size to the area buried in many protein-protein interactions, which would enable sHSPs to bind early unfolding intermediates. Reduced interactions of the Ps18.1 NTAs with each other and with the ACD contribute to the differences in dynamics and hydrophobic surface area of the two sHSPs. These data support a major role for the conformational equilibrium of the NTA in substrate binding and indicate features of the NTA that contribute to sHSP chaperone efficiency.",

Blocking ABCDE phosphorylation (by alanine mutation) imparts a dominant negative effect, rendering cells hypersensitive to agents that cause DNA double-strand breaks. Here, a mutational approach is used to address the mechanistic basis of this dominant negative effect. Blocking ABCDE phosphorylation hypersensitizes cells to most types of DNA damage (base damage, cross-links, breaks, and damage induced by replication stress), suggesting that DNA-PK binds DNA ends that result from many DNA lesions and that blocking ABCDE phosphorylation sequesters these DNA ends from other repair pathways. This dominant negative effect requires DNA-PK's catalytic activity, as well as phosphorylation of multiple (non-ABCDE) DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) sites. PSIPRED analysis indicates that the ABCDE sites are located in the only contiguous extended region of this huge protein that is predicted to be disordered, suggesting a regulatory role(s) and perhaps explaining the large impact ABCDE phosphorylation has on the enzyme's function. Moreover, additional sites in this disordered region contribute to the ABCDE cluster. These data, coupled with recent structural data, suggest a model whereby early phosphorylations promote initiation of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), whereas ABCDE phosphorylations, potentially located in a “hinge” region between the two domains, lead to regulated conformational changes that initially promote NHEJ and eventually disengage NHEJ.",

A vaccine that reduces parasitemia is desirable to achieve mass treatment with a low cost. Although potential antigens have been identified and tested in clinical trials, no effective vaccine against schistosomiasis is available. Y-box-binding proteins (YBPs) regulate gene expression and participate in a variety of cellular processes, including transcriptional and translational regulation, DNA repair, cellular proliferation, drug resistance, and stress responses. The Schistosoma mansoni ortholog of the human YB-1, SMYB1, is expressed in all stages of the parasite life cycle. Although SMYB1 binds to DNA or RNA oligonucleotides, immunohistochemistry assays demonstrated that it is primarily localized in the cytoplasm of parasite cells. In addition, SMYB1 interacts with a protein involved in mRNA processing, suggesting that SMYB1 functions in the turnover, transport, and/or stabilization of RNA molecules during post-transcriptional gene regulation. Here we report the potential of SMYB1 as a vaccine candidate. We demonstrate that recombinant SMYB1 stimulates the production of high levels of specific IgG1 antibodies in a mouse model. The observed levels of specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies indicate an actual protection against cercariae challenge. Animals immunized with rSMYB1 exhibited a 26% reduction in adult worm burden and a 28% reduction in eggs retained in the liver. Although proteins from the worm tegument are considered optimal targets for vaccine development, this study demonstrates that unexposed cytoplasmic proteins can reduce the load of intestinal worms and the number of eggs retained in the liver.",Schistosoma mansoni;Y-box-binding protein 1;SMYB1;cytoplasmic antigen;vaccine candidates

Although stimulation of many RTKs leads to activation of trimeric G proteins, the molecular mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain elusive. We discovered a unifying mechanism that allows GIV/Girdin, a bona fide metastasis-related protein and a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Gαi, to serve as a direct platform for multiple RTKs to activate Gαi proteins. Using a combination of homology modeling, protein–protein interaction, and kinase assays, we demonstrate that a stretch of ∼110 amino acids within GIV C-terminus displays structural plasticity that allows folding into a SH2-like domain in the presence of phosphotyrosine ligands. Using protein–protein interaction assays, we demonstrated that both SH2 and GEF domains of GIV are required for the formation of a ligand-activated ternary complex between GIV, Gαi, and growth factor receptors and for activation of Gαi after growth factor stimulation. Expression of a SH2-deficient GIV mutant (Arg 1745→Leu) that cannot bind RTKs impaired all previously demonstrated functions of GIV—Akt enhancement, actin remodeling, and cell migration. The mechanistic and structural insights gained here shed light on the long-standing questions surrounding RTK/G protein cross-talk, set a novel paradigm, and characterize a unique pharmacological target for uncoupling GIV-dependent signaling downstream of multiple oncogenic RTKs.",

YscU is a Yersinia pseudotuberculosis type III secretion system protein crucial for bacterial pathogenesis. The protein contains a highly conserved positively charged linker sequence that separates membrane-spanning and cytoplasmic (YscUC) domains. Although disordered in solution, inspection of the primary sequence of the linker reveals that positively charged residues are separated with a typical helical periodicity. Here, we demonstrate that the linker sequence of YscU undergoes a largely electrostatically driven coil-to-helix transition upon binding to negatively charged membrane interfaces. Using membrane-mimicking sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles, an NMR derived structural model reveals the induction of three helical segments in the linker. The overall linker placement in sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles was identified by NMR experiments including paramagnetic relaxation enhancements. Partitioning of individual residues agrees with their hydrophobicity and supports an interfacial positioning of the helices. Replacement of positively charged linker residues with alanine resulted in YscUC variants displaying attenuated membrane-binding affinities, suggesting that the membrane interaction depends on positive charges within the linker. In vivo experiments with bacteria expressing these YscU replacements resulted in phenotypes displaying significantly reduced effector protein secretion levels. Taken together, our data identify a previously unknown membrane-interacting surface of YscUC that, when perturbed by mutations, disrupts the function of the pathogenic machinery in Yersinia.",

The resulting tension between functional requirements and the risk of misfolding and/or aggregation in the evolution of proteins is becoming more and more apparent. One outcome of this tension is sensitivity to mutation, in which only subtle changes in sequence that may be functionally advantageous can tip the delicate balance toward protein aggregation. Similarly, increasing the concentration of aggregation-prone species by reducing the ability to control protein levels or compromising protein folding capacity engenders increased risk of aggregation and disease. In this Perspective, we describe examples that epitomize the tension between protein functional energy landscapes and aggregation risk. Each case illustrates how the energy landscapes for the at-risk proteins are sculpted to enable them to perform their functions and how the risks of aggregation are minimized under cellular conditions using a variety of compensatory mechanisms.",

Its characteristic hexameric ring-like core structure is formed by the highly conserved N-terminal regions. In contrast, the C-terminal forms an extension, which varies in length, lacks homology, and is predicted to be unstructured. In Gram-negative bacteria, Hfq facilitates the pairing of sRNAs with their mRNA target and thus affects gene expression, either positively or negatively, and modulates sRNA degradation. In Gram-positive bacteria, its role is still poorly characterized. Numerous sRNAs have been detected in many Gram-positive bacteria, but it is not yet known whether these sRNAs act in association with Hfq. Compared with all other Hfqs, the C. difficile Hfq exhibits an unusual C-terminal sequence with 75% asparagine and glutamine residues, while the N-terminal core part is more conserved. To gain insight into the functionality of the C. difficile Hfq (Cd-Hfq) protein in processes regulated by sRNAs, we have tested the ability of Cd-Hfq to fulfill the functions of the E. coli Hfq (Ec-Hfq) by examining various functions associated with Hfq in both positive and negative controls of gene expression. We found that Cd-Hfq substitutes for most but not all of the tested functions of the Ec-Hfq protein. We also investigated the role of the C-terminal part of the Hfq proteins.

Here we show that the intrinsically disordered N-terminal region of E7 from high risk HPV16 binds the TAZ2 domain of CBP with greater affinity than E7 from low risk HPV6b. HPV E7 and the tumor suppressor p53 compete for binding to TAZ2. The TAZ2 binding site in E7 overlaps the LxCxE motif that is crucial for interaction with pRb. While TAZ2 and pRb compete for binding to a monomeric E7 polypeptide, the full-length E7 dimer mediates an interaction between TAZ2 and pRb by promoting formation of a ternary complex. Cell-based assays show that expression of full-length HPV16 E7 promotes increased pRb acetylation and that this response depends both on the presence of CBP/p300 and the ability of E7 to form a dimer. These observations suggest a model for the oncogenic effect of high risk HPV16-E7. The disordered region of one E7 molecule in the homodimer interacts with the pocket domain of pRb, while the same region of the other E7 molecule binds the TAZ2 domain of CBP/p300. Through its ability to dimerize, E7 recruits CBP/p300 and pRb into a ternary complex, bringing the histone acetyltransferase domain of CBP/p300 into proximity to pRb and promoting acetylation, leading to disruption of cell cycle control.",human papilloma virus;intrinsic protein disorder;CBP/p300;acetyltransferase;p53;NMR

Pappu: ude.ltsuw@uppap ;∗Corresponding author ude.ltsuw@uppap","The aggregation of proteins with expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts is directly relevant to the formation of neuronal intranuclear inclusions in Huntington’s disease. In vitro studies have uncovered the effects of flanking sequences as modulators of the driving forces and mechanisms of polyQ aggregation in sequence segments associated with HD. Specifically, a seventeen-residue amphipathic stretch (N17) that is directly N-terminal to the polyQ tract in huntingtin decreases the overall solubility, destabilizes nonfibrillar aggregates, and accelerates fibril formation. Published results from atomistic simulations showed that the N17 module reduces the frequency of intermolecular association. Our reanalysis of these simulation results demonstrates that the N17 module also reduces interchain entanglements between polyQ domains. These two effects, which are observed on the smallest lengthscales, are incorporated into phenomenological pair potentials and used in coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations to investigate their impact on large-scale aggregation. We analyze the results from Brownian dynamics simulations using the framework of diffusion-limited cluster aggregation. When entanglements prevail, which is true in the absence of N17, small spherical clusters and large linear aggregates form on distinct timescales, in accord with in vitro experiments. Conversely, when entanglements are quenched and a barrier to intermolecular associations is introduced, both of which are attributable to N17, the timescales for forming small species and large linear aggregates become similar. Therefore, the combination of a reduction of interchain entanglements through homopolymeric polyQ and barriers to intermolecular associations appears to be sufficient for providing a minimalist phenomenological rationalization of in vitro observations regarding the effects of N17 on polyQ aggregation.",

An interaction with host factors must therefore place CTA1 in a folded conformation for the modification of its Gsα target which resides in a lipid raft environment. Host ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) act as in vitro allosteric activators of CTA1, but the molecular events of this process are not fully characterized. Isotope-edited Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy monitored ARF6-induced structural changes to CTA1, which were correlated to changes in CTA1 activity. We found ARF6 prevents the thermal disordering of structured CTA1 and stimulates the activity of stabilized CTA1 over a range of temperatures. Yet ARF6 alone did not promote the refolding of disordered CTA1 to an active state. Instead, lipid rafts shifted disordered CTA1 to a folded conformation with a basal level of activity that could be further stimulated by ARF6. Thus, ARF alone is unable to activate disordered CTA1 at physiological temperature: additional host factors such as lipid rafts place CTA1 in the folded conformation required for its ARF-mediated activation. Interaction with ARF is required for in vivo toxin activity, as enzymatically active CTA1 mutants that cannot be further stimulated by ARF6 fail to intoxicate cultured cells.",ADP-ribosylation factor;cholera toxin;Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy;host-pathogen interactions;protein folding

The UHM-containing alternative splicing factor CAPERα regulates splicing of tumor-promoting VEGF isoforms, yet the molecular target of the CAPERα UHM is unknown. Here we present structures of the CAPERα UHM bound to a representative SF3b155 ULM at 1.7 Å resolution and, for comparison, in the absence of ligand at 2.2 Å resolution. The prototypical UHM/ULM interactions authenticate CAPERα as a bona fide member of the UHM family of proteins. We identify SF3b155 as the relevant ULM-containing partner of full-length CAPERα in human cell extracts. Isothermal titration calorimetry comparisons of the purified CAPERα UHM binding known ULM-containing proteins demonstrate that high affinity interactions depend on the presence of an intact, intrinsically unstructured SF3b155 domain containing seven ULM-like motifs. The interplay among bound CAPERα molecules gives rise to the appearance of two high affinity sites in the SF3b155 ULM-containing domain. In conjunction with the previously identified, UHM/ULM-mediated complexes of U2AF65 and SPF45 with SF3b155, this work demonstrates the capacity of SF3b155 to offer a platform for coordinated recruitment of UHM-containing splicing factors.",Crystal Structure;Gene Regulation;Protein Domain;Protein-Protein Interaction;RNA Splicing;Protein Structure and Folding

The origin of eukaryotes was accompanied by emergence of a highly developed biochemical apparatus for encoding, resetting, and reading covalent epigenetic marks in proteins such as histones and tubulins. The provenance of this apparatus remained unclear until recently. Developments in comparative genomics show that key components of eukaryotic epigenetics emerged as part of the extensive biochemical innovation of secondary metabolism and intergenomic/interorganismal conflict systems in prokaryotes, particularly bacteria. These supplied not only enzymatic components for encoding and removing epigenetic modifications, but also readers of some of these marks. Diversification of these prokaryotic systems and subsequently eukaryotic epigenetics appear to have been considerably influenced by the great oxygenation event in the Earth’s history.",

molecular dynamics
simulations to compare the effects of lipid bilayer environment on
two peptides. Consistent with a previous experimental study,10 our results show a decided preference for the
membrane only in the case of CRAC336 near a 40% cholesterol,
60% DMPC bilayer. This preference is not seen for the same peptide
near a pure DMPC bilayer or for CRAC503 near either bilayer.
Furthermore, our work adds to ongoing experimental work in two key
ways: by identifying the role of disorder in cholesterol interactions
and by examining the role of the central Tyr in the CRAC motif. As
the CRAC336 peptide moves from solution to interact with
the 40% cholesterol bilayer, the peptide loses its helical propensity
and adopts a random coil conformation. The significance of disorder
in protein behavior is becoming more clear; numerous studies have
contributed examples of proteins that are disordered in their bound
state.29 Our work here highlights the role
of disorder in protein–membrane interactions. A single point
mutation of the central Tyr, converting it to Ala, resulted in loss
of the characteristic behavior of CRAC336 near the 40%
cholesterol bilayer, and though the central Tyr of the WT CRAC336 peptide interacts significantly with the cholesterol-bearing
bilayer, the same residue does not show the same high propensity for
interaction with the cholesterol-devoid bilayer. Furthermore, the
context dependence of the functionality of the CRAC domain is demonstrated
through a single-point mutation of the CRAC336 peptide
outside of the CRAC motif.",

Fragments of TDP-43, composed of the second RNA recognition motif (RRM2) and the disordered C terminus, have been observed in cytoplasmic inclusions in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases, suggesting that conformational changes involving RRM2 together with the disordered C terminus play a role in aggregation and toxicity. The biophysical data collected by CD and fluorescence spectroscopies reveal a three-state equilibrium unfolding model for RRM2, with a partially folded intermediate state that is not observed in RRM1. Strikingly, a portion of RRM2 beginning at position 208, which mimics a cleavage site observed in patient tissues, increases the population of this intermediate state. Mutually stabilizing interactions between the domains in the tethered RRM1 and RRM2 construct reduce the population of the intermediate state and enhance DNA/RNA binding. Despite the high sequence homology of the two domains, a network of large hydrophobic residues in RRM2 provides a possible explanation for the increased stability of RRM2 compared with RRM1. The cluster analysis suggests that the intermediate state may play a functional role by enhancing access to the nuclear export signal contained within its sequence.

In this report we demonstrate that the binding affinity of Ng for CaM is weakened by Ca2+ but to a lesser extent (2–3-fold) than that previously suggested from qualitative observations. We also show that Ng induced a >10-fold decrease in the affinity of Ca2+ binding to the C-terminal domain of CaM with an associated increase in the Ca2+ dissociation rate. We also discovered a modest, but potentially important, increase in the cooperativity in Ca2+ binding to the C-lobe of CaM in the presence of Ng, thus sharpening the threshold for the C-domain to become Ca2+-saturated. Domain mapping using synthetic peptides indicated that the IQ motif of Ng is a poor mimetic of the intact protein and that the acidic sequence just N-terminal to the IQ motif plays an important role in reproducing Ng-mediated decreases in the Ca2+ binding affinity of CaM. Using NMR, full-length Ng was shown to make contacts largely with residues in the C-domain of CaM, although contacts were also detected in residues in the N-terminal domain. Together, our results can be consolidated into a model where Ng contacts residues in the N- and C-lobes of both apo- and Ca2+-bound CaM and that although Ca2+ binding weakens Ng interactions with CaM, the most dramatic biochemical effect is the impact of Ng on Ca2+ binding to the C-terminal lobe of CaM.",Calcium;Calmodulin;Cell Signaling;Intrinsically Disordered Proteins;Isothermal Titration Calorimetry;Kinetics;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance;Protein Structure;Protein-Protein Interactions;Signal Transduction

E-mail ude.retsehcor@revluc.airolg","The small subunit (SSU) of the ribosome of E. coli consists of a core of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) surrounded peripherally by ribosomal proteins (r-proteins). Ten of the 15 universally conserved SSU r-proteins possess nonglobular regions called extensions. The N-terminal noncanonically structured extension of S12 traverses from the solvent to intersubunit surface of the SSU and is followed by a more C-terminal globular region that is adjacent to the decoding center of the SSU. The role of the globular region in maintaining translational fidelity is well characterized, but a role for the S12 extension in SSU structure and function is unknown. We examined the effect of stepwise truncation of the extension of S12 in SSU assembly and function in vitro and in vivo. Examination of in vitro assembly in the presence of sequential N-terminal truncated variants of S12 reveals that N-terminal deletions of greater than nine amino acids exhibit decreased tRNA-binding activity and altered 16S rRNA architecture particularly in the platform of the SSU. While wild-type S12 expressed from a plasmid can rescue a genomic deletion of the essential gene for S12, rpsl; N-terminal deletions of S12 exhibit deleterious phenotypic consequences. Partial N-terminal deletions of S12 are slow growing and cold sensitive. Strains bearing these truncations as the sole copy of S12 have increased levels of free SSUs and immature 16S rRNA as compared with the wild-type S12. These differences are hallmarks of SSU biogenesis defects, indicating that the extension of S12 plays an important role in SSU assembly.",ribosome;small subunit;biogenesis;assembly;S12;intrinsically disordered proteins

In the current work, we present PCASSO (Protein C-Alpha Secondary Structure Output), a fast and accurate program for assigning protein secondary structure elements using only the Cα positions. PCASSO achieves ~95% accuracy with respect to DSSP and takes ~0.1 s using a single processor to analyze a 1,000 residue system with multiple chains.

Phosphotyrosines frequently target SH2 domains. The spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is critical for tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins and for regulation of important pathways. Phosphorylation of both Y342 and Y346 in Syk linker B is required for optimal signaling. The SH2 domains of Vav1 and PLC-γ both bind this doubly phosphorylated motif. Here we used a recently developed method to calculate the effects of Y342 and Y346 phosphorylation on the rate constants of a peptide from Syk linker B binding to the SH2 domains of Vav1 and PLC-γ. The predicted effects agree well with experimental observations. Moreover, we found that the same doubly phosphorylated peptide binds the two SH2 domains via distinct mechanisms, with apparent rigid docking for Vav1 SH2 and dock-and-coalesce for PLC-γ SH2.",transient complex;association rate constant;association mechanism;dock-and-coalesce;electrostatic interactions;phosphorylation

The investigation of α-synuclein variants causative of familial forms of Parkinson disease can provide unique insights into the conditions that promote or inhibit aggregate formation. It has been shown recently that a newly identified pathogenic mutation of α-synuclein, H50Q, aggregates faster than the wild-type. We investigate here its aggregation propensity by using a sequence-based prediction algorithm, NMR chemical shift analysis of secondary structure populations in the monomeric state, and determination of thermodynamic stability of the fibrils. Our data show that the H50Q mutation induces only a small increment in polyproline II structure around the site of the mutation and a slight increase in the overall aggregation propensity. We also find, however, that the H50Q mutation strongly stabilizes α-synuclein fibrils by 5.0 ± 1.0 kJ mol−1, thus increasing the supersaturation of monomeric α-synuclein within the cell, and strongly favors its aggregation process. We further show that wild-type α-synuclein can decelerate the aggregation kinetics of the H50Q variant in a dose-dependent manner when coaggregating with it. These last findings suggest that the precise balance of α-synuclein synthesized from the wild-type and mutant alleles may influence the natural history and heterogeneous clinical phenotype of Parkinson disease.",alpha-Synuclein (a-synuclein);Amyloid;Fibril;Parkinson Disease;Protein Aggregation;Aggregation Propensity;Fibrils Thermodynamic Stability;Polyproline II Structure

General consensus holds that proteins are the prime targets; heavy metals interfere with the physiological activity of specific, particularly susceptible proteins, either by forming a complex with functional side chain groups or by displacing essential metal ions in metalloproteins. Recent studies have revealed an additional mode of metal action targeted at proteins in a non-native state; certain heavy metals and metalloids have been found to inhibit the in vitro refolding of chemically denatured proteins, to interfere with protein folding in vivo and to cause aggregation of nascent proteins in living cells. Apparently, unfolded proteins with motile backbone and side chains are considerably more prone to engage in stable, pluridentate metal complexes than native proteins with their well-defined 3D structure. By interfering with the folding process, heavy metal ions and metalloids profoundly affect protein homeostasis and cell viability.

This paper addresses the fundamental issue of encoding amino acids in ways that the representation of such a protein sequence facilitates the decoding of its information content. We show that a feature-based representation in a three-dimensional (3D) space derived from amino acid substitution matrices provides an adequate representation that can be used for direct comparison of protein sequences based on geometry. We measure the performance of such a representation in the context of the protein structural fold prediction problem. We compare the results of classifying different sets of proteins belonging to distinct structural folds against classifications of the same proteins obtained from sequence alone or directly from structural information. We find that sequence alone performs poorly as a structure classifier. We show in contrast that the use of the three dimensional representation of the sequences significantly improves the classification accuracy. We conclude with a discussion of the current limitations of such a representation and with a description of potential improvements.,Protein sequences;Substitution matrices;Protein sequence classification;Fold recognition

Despite recent advances, our understanding of the molecular design, self-assembly, and structure-function relationship of those natural amyloid fibers remains limited. Thus, designing biomimetic amyloid-based adhesives remains challenging. Here, we report strong and multi-functional underwater adhesives obtained from fusing mussel foot proteins (Mfps) of Mytilus galloprovincialis with CsgA proteins, the major subunit of Escherichia coli amyloid curli fibers. These hybrid molecular materials hierarchically self-assemble into higher-order structures, in which, according to molecular dynamics simulations, disordered adhesive Mfp domains are exposed on the exterior of amyloid cores formed by CsgA. Our fibers have an underwater adhesion energy approaching 20.9 mJ/m2, which is 1.5 times greater than the maximum of bio-inspired and bio-derived protein-based underwater adhesives reported thus far. Moreover, they outperform Mfps or curli fibers taken on their own at all pHs and exhibit better tolerance to auto-oxidation than Mfps at pH ≥7.0.

Over the past 50 years, many thermodynamic and kinetic studies have been performed addressing the stability of globular proteins. In comparison, advances in the membrane protein folding field lag far behind. Although membrane proteins constitute about a third of the proteins encoded in known genomes, stability studies on membrane proteins have been impaired due to experimental limitations. Furthermore, no systematic experimental strategies are available for folding these biomolecules in vitro. Common denaturing agents such as chaotropes usually do not work on helical membrane proteins, and ionic detergents have been successful denaturants only in few cases. Refolding a membrane protein seems to be a craftsman work, which is relatively straightforward for transmembrane β-barrel proteins but challenging for α-helical membrane proteins. Additional complexities emerge in multidomain membrane proteins, data interpretation being one of the most critical.

However, connection of the genomic information to cellular functions and biological behaviours relies on the development of effective approaches at higher systems level. In particular, advances in RNA-Seq technology has helped the studies of transcriptome, RNA expressed from the genome, while systems biology on the other hand provides more comprehensive pictures, from which genes and proteins actively interact to lead to cellular behaviours and physiological phenotypes. As biological interactions mediate many biological processes that are essential for cellular function or disease development, it is important to systematically identify genomic information including genetic mutations from GWAS (genome-wide association study), differentially expressed genes, bidirectional promoters, intrinsic disordered proteins (IDP) and protein interactions to gain deep insights into the underlying mechanisms of gene regulations and networks. Furthermore, bidirectional promoters can co-regulate many biological pathways, where the roles of bidirectional promoters can be studied systematically for identifying co-regulating genes at interactive network level. Combining information from different but related studies can ultimately help revealing the landscape of molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases such as cancer.",

PICT1 depletion results in the release of L11 to the nucleoplasm to inhibit MDM2, leading to p53 activation. Here, we demonstrate that nucleolar stress induces proteasome-mediated degradation of PICT1 in a ubiquitin-independent manner. Treatment of H1299 cells with nucleolar stress inducers, such as actinomycin D, 5-fluorouridine, or doxorubicin, induced the degradation of PICT1 protein. The proteasome inhibitors MG132, lactacystin, and epoxomicin blocked PICT1 degradation, whereas the inhibition of E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme by a specific inhibitor and genetic inactivation fail to repress PICT1 degradation. In addition, the 20 S proteasome was able to degrade purified PICT1 protein in vitro. We also found a PICT1 mutant showing nucleoplasmic localization did not undergo nucleolar stress-induced degradation, although the same mutant underwent in vitro degradation by the 20 S proteasome, suggesting that nucleolar localization is indispensable for the stress-induced PICT1 degradation. These results suggest that PICT1 employs atypical proteasome-mediated degradation machinery to sense nucleolar stress within the nucleolus.",Cell Signaling;Nucleolus;Proteasome;Protein Degradation;Signal Transduction;Stress Response;Nucleolar Stress

MxA consists of an N-terminal globular GTPase domain, a connecting bundle signaling element, and the C-terminal stalk that mediates oligomerization and antiviral specificity. We previously reported that the disordered loop L4 that protrudes from the compact stalk is a key determinant of antiviral specificity against influenza A and Thogoto virus. However, the role of individual amino acids for viral target recognition remained largely undefined. By mutational analyses, we identified two regions in the C-terminal part of L4 that contribute to an antiviral interface. Mutations in the proximal motif, at positions 561 and 562, abolished antiviral activity against orthomyxoviruses but not bunyaviruses. In contrast, mutations in the distal motif, around position 577, abolished antiviral activity against both viruses. These results indicate that at least two structural elements in L4 are responsible for antiviral activity and that the proximal motif determines specificity for orthomyxoviruses, whereas the distal sequence serves a conserved structural function.",Antiviral Agents;GTPase;Influenza Virus;Innate Immunity;Interferon;MxA;Dynamin;Myxovirus Resistance

The first four ankyrin repeats (ARs) of the IκBα ARD are well-folded, but the AR5-6 region is intrinsically disordered according to amide H/D exchange and protein folding/unfolding experiments. We previously showed that mutations towards the consensus sequence for stable ankyrin repeats resulted in a “prefolded” mutant. To investigate whether the consensus mutations were uniquely able to order the AR5-6 region, we used a predictor of protein disordered regions PONDR VL-XT to select mutations that would alter the intrinsic disorder towards a more ordered structure (D→O mutants). The algorithm predicted two mutations, E282W and P261F, neither of which correspond to the consensus sequence for ankyrin repeats. Amide exchange and CD were used to assess ordering. Although only the E282W was predicted to be more ordered by CD and amide exchange, stopped-flow fluorescence studies showed that both of the D→O mutants were less efficient at dissociating NFκB from DNA.",

Here, we report an advance in understanding the molecular basis of emerin function: intermolecular emerin–emerin association. There were two modes: one mediated by association of residues 170–220 in one emerin molecule to residues 170–220 in another, and the second involving residues 170–220 and 1–132. Deletion analysis showed residues 187–220 contain a positive element essential for intermolecular association in cells. By contrast, deletion of residues 168–186 inactivated a proposed negative element, required to limit or control association. Association of GFP–emerin with nuclear BAF in cells required the LEM domain (residues 1–47) and the positive element. Emerin peptide arrays revealed direct binding of residues 170–220 to residues 206–225 (the proposed positive element), residues 147–174 (particularly P153MYGRDSAYQSITHYRP169) and the LEM domain.

Currently, the mechanisms underlying the conversion of soluble nuclear U1 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins into insoluble cytoplasmic aggregates remain elusive. Based on the biochemical and subcellular distribution properties of U1-70K in AD, we hypothesized that aggregated U1-70K itself or other biopolymers (e.g. proteins or nucleic acids) interact with and sequester natively folded soluble U1-70K into insoluble aggregates. Here, we demonstrate that total homogenates from AD brain induce soluble U1-70K from control brain or recombinant U1-70K to become Sarkosyl-insoluble. This effect was not dependent on RNA and did not correlate with detergent-insoluble Tau levels as AD homogenates with reduced levels of these components were still capable of inducing U1-70K aggregation. In contrast, proteinase K-treated AD homogenates and Sarkosyl-soluble AD fractions were unable to induce U1-70K aggregation, indicating that aggregated proteins in AD brain are responsible for inducing soluble U1-70K aggregation. It was determined that the C terminus of U1-70K, which harbors two disordered low complexity (LC) domains, is necessary for U1-70K aggregation. Moreover, both LC1 and LC2 domains were sufficient for aggregation. Finally, protein cross-linking and mass spectrometry studies demonstrated that a U1-70K fragment harboring the LC1 domain directly interacts with aggregated U1-70K in AD brain. Our results support a hypothesis that aberrant forms of U1-70K in AD can directly sequester soluble forms of U1-70K into insoluble aggregates.",Neurodegenerative Disease;Protein Aggregation;RNA;Spliceosome;Tau Protein (Tau)

To explore the biophysical mechanism underlying such transitions we use a three-letter continuous protein model with seven atoms per amino acid to provide realistic sequence-structure and sequence-function mappings through explicit simulation of the folding and interaction of model sequences. We start from two 16-amino-acid sequences folding into an α-helix and a β-hairpin, respectively, each of which has a preferred binding partner with 35 amino acids. We identify a mutational pathway between the two folds, which features a sharp fold switch. By contrast, we find that the transition in function is smooth. Moreover, the switch in preferred binding partner does not coincide with the fold switch. Discovery of new folds in evolution might therefore be facilitated by following fitness slopes in sequence space underpinned by binding-induced conformational switching.",

Gardner,"Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA;*Author for correspondence (ude.wu@rrendrag)","Cdc48, known as p97 or valosin-containing protein (VCP) in mammals, is an abundant AAA-ATPase that is essential for many ubiquitin-dependent processes. One well-documented role for Cdc48 is in facilitating the delivery of ubiquitylated misfolded endoplasmic reticulum proteins to the proteasome for degradation. By contrast, the role for Cdc48 in misfolded protein degradation in the nucleus is unknown. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, degradation of misfolded proteins in the nucleus is primarily mediated by the nuclear-localized ubiquitin-protein ligase San1, which ubiquitylates misfolded nuclear proteins for proteasomal degradation. Here, we find that, although Cdc48 is involved in the degradation of some San1 substrates, it is not universally required. The difference in the requirement for Cdc48 correlates with the insolubility of the San1 substrate. The more insoluble the substrate, the more its degradation requires Cdc48. Expression of Cdc48-dependent San1 substrates in mutant cdc48 cells results in increased substrate insolubility, larger inclusion formation and reduced cell viability. Substrate ubiquitylation is increased in mutant cdc48 cells, suggesting that Cdc48 functions downstream of San1. Taken together, we propose that Cdc48 acts, in part, to maintain the solubility or reverse the aggregation of insoluble misfolded proteins prior to their proteasomal degradation.",Cdc48;VCP;p97;San1;Misfolded protein;Proteasome;Protein quality control;Ubiquitin

Adding or removing a dianionic phosphate group somewhere on a protein often changes the protein’s structural properties, its stability and dynamics. Moreover, the majority of signaling pathways involve an extensive set of protein–protein interactions, and phosphorylation can be used to regulate and modulate protein–protein binding. Losses of phosphorylation sites, as a result of disease mutations, might disrupt protein binding and deregulate signal transduction. In this paper we focus on the effects of phosphorylation on protein stability, dynamics, and binding. We describe several physico-chemical mechanisms of protein regulation through phosphorylation and pay particular attention to phosphorylation in protein complexes and phosphorylation in the context of disorder–order and order–disorder transitions. Finally we assess the role of multiple phosphorylation sites in a protein molecule, their possible cooperativity and function.",protein phosphorylation;protein–protein interactions;allosteric regulation;protein disorder;multisite phosphorylation

We show the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) Ube2w employs a novel mechanism to facilitate the specific ubiquitination of the α-amino group of its substrates that involves recognition of backbone atoms of intrinsically disordered N-termini. We present the NMR-based solution ensemble of full-length Ube2w that reveals a structural architecture unlike any other E2, in which its C-terminus is partly disordered and flexible to accommodate variable substrate N-termini. Flexibility of the substrate is critical for recognition by Ube2w and point mutations in, or removal of, the flexible C-terminus of Ube2w inhibits substrate binding and modification.

detection system, all three constructs were covalently labeled with
the small fluorescent dye fluorescein. The purified protein (stock
solutions kept at ≈2 mM) was dissolved to a concentration of
100 μM in NaCO3 buffer. A small amount of fluorescein-5-EX
succinimidyl ester (Life Technologies) was dissolved in DMSO and the
concentration determined by absorbance measurement of a dilution in
NaCO3 buffer. The dissolved fluorescein-5-EX succinimidyl
ester was added to the protein solution to achieve a final protein:dye
ratio of 1:6. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h at room
temperature. To facilitate the reaction, the mixture was placed on
a slowly rotating turntable. The reaction was stopped by performing
three thermal cycles to remove free dye. To fully equilibrate the
protein back into PBS buffer from the NaCO3 buffer, the
final cold supernatant was passed over a Penefsky column.14 An amino specific probe is used rather than
a Cys acting fluorescent probe to allow labeling of both sites in

Increasing interest in intrinsically disordered systems and the desire to target ensembles of protein conformations (rather than single structures) in drug development motivate the need for enhanced sampling algorithms that are not limited to “two-basin” problems, and can efficiently determine structural ensembles. For systems that are not well-studied, this must often be done with little or no information about the dynamics of interest. Here we present a novel strategy to determine structural ensembles that uses dynamically defined sampling regions that are organized in a hierarchical framework. It is based on the weighted ensemble algorithm, where an ensemble of copies of the system (“replicas”) is directed to new regions of configuration space through merging and cloning operations. The sampling hierarchy allows for a large number of regions to be defined, while using only a small number of replicas that can be balanced over multiple length scales. We demonstrate this algorithm on two model systems that are analytically solvable and examine the 10-residue peptide chignolin in explicit solvent. The latter system is analyzed using a configuration space network and novel hydrogen bonds are found that facilitate folding.",rare events;enhanced sampling;chignolin;order parameters;Voronoi polyhedra

Vif neutralizes the antiviral activities of the APOBEC3G/F by diverse mechanisms including their degradation through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway and their translational inhibition. In addition, Vif appears to be an active partner of the late steps of viral replication by interacting with Pr55Gag, reverse transcriptase and genomic RNA. Here, we expressed and purified full-length and truncated Vif proteins, and analyzed their RNA binding and chaperone properties. First, we showed by CD and NMR spectroscopies that the N-terminal domain of Vif is highly structured in solution, whereas the C-terminal domain remains mainly unfolded. Both domains exhibited substantial RNA binding capacities with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range, whereas the basic unfolded C-terminal domain of Vif was responsible in part for its RNA chaperone activity. Second, we showed by NMR chemical shift mapping that Vif and NCp7 share the same binding sites on tRNALys3, the primer of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.

We test this hypothesis by probing intramolecular distance distributions during folding in one of the paradigms of folding reactions, that of cytochrome c. The Trp59 to heme distance was probed by time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (trFRET) in the microsecond time range of refolding. Contrary to expectation, a state with a Trp59-heme distance close to that of the GdnHCl denatured state is present after ~27 µs of folding. A concomitant decrease in the population of this state and an increase in the population of a compact high-FRET state (efficiency > 90%) show that the collapse is barrier-limited. Small-angle x-ray scattering measurements over a similar time range show that the radius of gyration under native favoring conditions is comparable to that of the GdnHCl denatured unfolded state. An independent comprehensive global thermodynamic analysis reveals that marginally stable partially folded structures are also present in the nominally unfolded GdnHCl denatured state. These observations suggest that specifically collapsed intermediate structures with low stability in rapid equilibrium with the unfolded state may contribute to the apparent chain contraction observed in previous fluorescence studies using steady state detection. In the absence of significant dynamic averaging of marginally stable partially folded states and with use of probes sensitive to distance distributions, barrier-limited chain contraction is observed upon transfer of the GdnHCl denatured state ensemble to native like conditions.",protein folding;FRET;small-angle x-ray scattering;unfolded state

The phosphorylation sites are relatively less mutated than other residues in p53. To understand why and how p53 phosphorylation sites are rarely mutated in human cancer, using a bioinformatics approaches, we examined the phosphorylation site and its nearby flanking residues, focusing on the consensus phosphorylation motif pattern, amino-acid correlations within the phosphorylation motifs, the propensity of structural disorder of the phosphorylation motifs, and cancer mutations observed within the phosphorylation motifs. Many p53 phosphorylation sites are targets for several kinases. The phosphorylation sites match 17 consensus sequence motifs out of the 29 classified. In addition to proline, which is common in kinase specificity-determining sites, we found high propensity of acidic residues to be adjacent to phosphorylation sites. Analysis of human cancer mutations in the phosphorylation motifs revealed that motifs with adjacent acidic residues generally have fewer mutations, in contrast to phosphorylation sites near proline residues. p53 phosphorylation motifs are mostly disordered. However, human cancer mutations within phosphorylation motifs tend to decrease the disorder propensity. Our results suggest that combination of acidic residues Asp and Glu with phosphorylation sites provide charge redundancy which may safe guard against loss-of-function mutations, and that the natively disordered nature of p53 phosphorylation motifs may help reduce mutational damage. Our results further suggest that engineering acidic amino acids adjacent to potential phosphorylation sites could be a p53 gene therapy strategy.",phosphorylation;p53 protein;p63;p73;protein binding site;cancer;intrinsically disordered proteins

These intrinsic motions are structurally encoded, and Nature makes use of them to catalyze chemical reactions by means of ligand-induced conformational changes and states redistribution. Such mechanisms align reactive groups for efficient chemistry and stabilize conformers most proficient for catalysis. By combining single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer measurements with normal mode analysis and coarse-grained mesoscopic simulations, we obtained results for a hinge-bending enzyme, namely phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), which support and extend these ideas. From single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer, we obtained insight into the distribution of conformational states and the dynamical properties of the domains. The simulations allowed for the characterization of interdomain motions of a compact state of PGK. The data show that PGK is intrinsically a highly dynamic system sampling a wealth of conformations on timescales ranging from nanoseconds to milliseconds and above. Functional motions encoded in the fold are performed by the PGK domains already in its ligand-free form, and substrate binding is not required to enable them. Compared to other multidomain proteins, these motions are rather fast and presumably not rate-limiting in the enzymatic reaction. Ligand binding slightly readjusts the orientation of the domains and feasibly locks the protein motions along a preferential direction. In addition, the functionally relevant compact state is stabilized by the substrates, and acts as a prestate to reach active conformations by means of Brownian motions.",

The multimeric TOC complex contains two GTP-regulated receptors, Toc34 and Toc159, which recognize the transit peptides of preproteins and initiate protein import through a β–barrel membrane channel, Toc75. Different isoforms of Toc34 and Toc159 assemble with Toc75 to form structurally and functionally diverse translocons, and the composition and levels of TOC translocons is required for the import of specific subsets of coordinately expressed proteins during plant growth and development. Consequently, the proper assembly of the TOC complexes is key to ensuring organelle homeostasis. This review will focus on our current knowledge of the targeting and assembly of TOC components to form functional translocons at the outer membrane. Our analyses reveal that the targeting of TOC components involves elements common to the targeting of other outer membrane proteins, but also include unique features that appear to have evolved to specifically facilitate assembly of the import apparatus.",chloroplast;outer envelope membrane;protein targeting;translocon;TOC assembly;protein import

A mechanical crosstalk can arise from this competition. In this article, we dissect the biomechanical sequence caused by a controlled compressive stress on multicellular spheroids (MCSs) used as a tumor model system. On timescales of minutes, we show that a compressive stress causes a reduction of the MCS volume, linked to a reduction of the cell volume in the core of the MCS. On timescales of hours, we observe a reversible induction of the proliferation inhibitor, p27Kip1, from the center to the periphery of the spheroid. On timescales of days, we observe that cells are blocked in the cell cycle at the late G1 checkpoint, the restriction point. We show that the effect of pressure on the proliferation can be antagonized by silencing p27Kip1. Finally, we quantify a clear correlation between the pressure-induced volume change and the growth rate of the spheroid. The compression-induced proliferation arrest that we studied is conserved for five cell lines, and is completely reversible. It demonstrates a generic crosstalk between mechanical stresses and the key players of cell cycle regulation. Our results suggest a role of volume change in the sensitivity to pressure, and that p27Kip1 is strongly influenced by this change.",

Hybrid simulation/experiment strategies have been undermined by difficulties in evaluating errors from computational model inaccuracies and data uncertainties. Building on recent proposals from maximum entropy theory and nonequilibrium thermodynamics, we address these issues through a Bayesian energy landscape tilting (BELT) scheme for computing Bayesian hyperensembles over conformational ensembles. BELT uses Markov chain Monte Carlo to directly sample maximum-entropy conformational ensembles consistent with a set of input experimental observables. To test this framework, we apply BELT to model trialanine, starting from disagreeing simulations with the force fields ff96, ff99, ff99sbnmr-ildn, CHARMM27, and OPLS-AA. BELT incorporation of limited chemical shift and 3J measurements gives convergent values of the peptide’s α, β, and PPII conformational populations in all cases. As a test of predictive power, all five BELT hyperensembles recover set-aside measurements not used in the fitting and report accurate errors, even when starting from highly inaccurate simulations. BELT’s principled framework thus enables practical predictions for complex biomolecular systems from discordant simulations and sparse data.",

In addition, there has been increased research focusing on the key features of protein folding in the cell that differentiate it from in-vitro folding, such as co-translational folding, chaperone-facilitated folding, and folding in crowded conditions with many weak interactions. Yet these two research areas have not been bridged effectively in research carried out to date. This review points to gaps between the two that are ripe for future research. Moreover, we emphasize the biological selection pressures that impact protein folding in-vivo and how fitness drives the evolution of protein sequences in ways that may place foldability in tension with other requirements on a given protein.

The SRPKs efficiently phosphorylate the arginine-serine dipeptides in the RS domain using a conserved docking groove in the kinase domain. In contrast, CLKs lack a docking groove and phosphorylate both arginine-serine and serine-proline dipeptides, modifications that generate a hyper-phosphorylated state important for unique SR protein-dependent splicing activities. All CLKs contain long, flexible N-terminal extensions (140-300 residues) that resemble the RS domains present in their substrate SR proteins. We showed that the N-terminus in CLK1 contacts both the kinase domain and the RS domain of the SR protein SRSF1. This interaction not only is essential for facilitating hyper-phosphorylation but also induces cooperative binding of SRSF1 to RNA.

Nematode effector proteins are synthesized in the oesophageal glands of nematodes and secreted into plant tissue through a needle‐like stylet. Effectors characterized to date have been shown to mediate processes essential for nematode pathogenesis. To gain an insight into their site of action and putative function, the subcellular localization of 13 previously isolated Meloidogyne incognita effectors was determined. Translational fusions were created between effectors and EGFP‐GUS (enhanced green fluorescent protein‐β‐glucuronidase) reporter genes, which were transiently expressed in tobacco leaf cells. The majority of effectors localized to the cytoplasm, with one effector, 7H08, imported into the nuclei of plant cells. Deletion analysis revealed that the nuclear localization of 7H08 was mediated by two novel independent nuclear localization domains. As a result of the nuclear localization of the effector, 7H08 was tested for the ability to activate gene transcription. 7H08 was found to activate the expression of reporter genes in both yeast and plant systems. This is the first report of a plant‐parasitic nematode effector with transcriptional activation activity.",effector;interaction;Meloidogyne incognita;NLS;nuclear import;root‐knot nematode;transcriptional activation activity

represents a particularly intriguing PTM given that the size of the
modification (76 amino acids) rivals the size of the histone substrate.
In contrast to polyubiquitylation, which commonly serves to flag proteins
for degradation, the monoubiquitylation signals observed on H2A and
H2B are associated with regulation of gene expression.14 Detailed evaluation of the genomic distribution
of H2B modified with ubiquitin at Lys120 (H2B-K120ub) was enabled
by an antibody that specifically recognizes this species.187 As described by Minsky et al.,187 a branched peptide encompassing residues 116–124
of H2B and the C-terminal four residues of ubiquitin, conjugated to
H2B-K120 via an isopeptide bond, served as a surrogate for H2B-ubiquitin
in the immunization process. The authors subsequently performed ChIP
assays on human cell lines with this antibody and found that H2B ubiquitination
occurs in the transcribed regions of highly expressed genes. Beyond
antibody preparation, fully understanding the diversity of direct
biochemical and biophysical consequences of attaching ubiquitin and
related proteins to histones required the development of synthetic
strategies for site-specific attachment of the complete ubiquitin
protein to histones. A key step toward this goal involved the synthesis
of peptide-ubiquitin conjugates.188 As
this process hinges upon protein ligation techniques, we defer its
detailed description to section 4.3.5.",

This departure from the strictly lysine-rich composition of the somatic histone H1 raises a question about the true definition of its protein members. Their minimal essential requirements appear to be the presence of a lysine- and alanine–rich, intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain, with a highly helicogenic potential upon binding to the linker DNA regions of chromatin. In metazoans, specific targeting of these regions is further achieved by a linker histone fold domain (LHFD), distinctively different from the characteristic core histone fold domain (CHFD) of the nucleosome core histones.",chromatin;nucleosome;linker DNA;histone;histone-fold

In the present studies, we investigated the role of post-translational modification in the accumulation of MKP-1 and MKP-2 in macrophages following LPS stimulation. We found that upon LPS stimulation, MKP-1 and MKP-2 accumulated with different kinetics: MKP-1 level peaked at ∼1 h, while MKP-2 levels continued to rise for at least 6 h. Accumulation of both MKP-1 and MKP-2 were attenuated by inhibition of the ERK cascade. Interestingly, p38 inhibition prior to LPS stimulation had little effect on MKP-1 and MKP-2 protein levels, but hindered their detection by an M-18 MKP-1 antibody. Studies of the epitope sequence recognized by the M-18 MKP-1 antibody revealed extensive phosphorylation of two serine residues in the C terminus of both MKP-1 and MKP-2 by the ERK pathway. Remarkably, the stability of both MKP-1 and MKP-2 was markedly decreased in macrophages in the presence of an ERK pathway inhibitor. Mutation of the two C-terminal serine residues in MKP-1 and MKP-2 to alanine decreased their half-lives, while mutating these residues to aspartate dramatically increased their half-lives. Deletion of the C terminus from MKP-1 and MKP-2 also considerably increased their stabilities. Surprisingly, enhanced stabilities of the MKP-1 and MKP-2 mutants were not associated with decreased ubiquitination. Degradation of both MKP-1 and MKP-2 was attenuated by proteasomal inhibitors. Our studies suggest that MKP-1 and MKP-2 stability is regulated by ERK-mediated phosphorylation through a degradation pathway independent of polyubiquitination.",Lipopolysaccharide (LPS);Macrophage;Phosphorylation;Post-translational Modification (PTM);Protein Stability;Ubiquitylation (Ubiquitination);MAP Kinase Phosphatase

Tick saliva contains a complex mix of anti-host defense factors, including the immunosuppressive cysteine-rich secretory glycoprotein Salp15 from Ixodes scapularis ticks and orthologs like Iric-1 from Ixodesricinus. All tick-borne microbes benefit from the immunosuppression at the tick bite site; in addition, borreliae exploit the binding of Salp15 to their outer surface protein C (OspC) for enhanced transmission. Hence, Salp15 proteins are attractive targets for anti-tick vaccines that also target borreliae. However, recombinant Salp proteins are not accessible in sufficient quantity for either vaccine manufacturing or for structural characterization. As an alternative to low-yield eukaryotic systems, we investigated cytoplasmic expression in Escherichia coli, even though this would not result in glycosylation. His-tagged Salp15 was efficiently expressed but insoluble. Among the various solubility-enhancing protein tags tested, DsbA was superior, yielding milligram amounts of soluble, monomeric Salp15 and Iric-1 fusions. Easily accessible mutants enabled epitope mapping of two monoclonal antibodies that, importantly, cross-react with glycosylated Salp15, and revealed interaction sites with OspC. Free Salp15 and Iric-1 from protease-cleavable fusions, despite limited solubility, allowed the recording of 1H–15N 2D NMR spectra, suggesting partial folding of the wild-type proteins but not of Cys-free variants. Fusion to the NMR-compatible GB1 domain sufficiently enhanced solubility to reveal first secondary structure elements in 13C/15N double-labeled Iric-1.

The algorithm takes as input two triangulated genus zero surfaces representing the protein and the round sphere, respectively, and constructs a discrete conformal map f between these surfaces. The conformal map is chosen to minimize a symmetric elastic energy ES(f) that measures the distance of f from an isometry. We illustrate our approach on a set of basic sample problems and then on a dataset of diverse protein structures. We show first that ES(f) is able to quantify the roundness of the Platonic solids and that for these surfaces it replicates well traditional measures of roundness such as the sphericity. We then demonstrate that the symmetric elastic energy ES(f) captures both global and local differences between two surfaces, showing that our method identifies the presence of protruding regions in protein structures and quantifies how these regions make the shape of a protein deviate from globularity. Based on these results, we show that ES(f) serves as a probe of the limits of the application of conformal mapping to parametrize protein shapes. We identify limitations of the method and discuss its extension to achieving automatic registration of protein structures based on their surface geometry.",proteins;genus zero surfaces;conformal mapping;diffeomorphism;triangular mesh

A one-bead-per-amino-acid model is presented that accounts for the hydrophobic/hydrophilic and electrostatic interactions between different amino acids, polarity of the solvent, and screening of free ions. The results indicate that the interaction of the FG-nups forms a high-density, doughnut-like distribution inside the NPC, which is rich in FG-repeats. We show that the obtained distribution is encoded in the amino-acid sequence of the FG-nups and is driven by both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. To explore the relation between structure and function, we have systematically removed different combinations of FG-nups from the pore to simulate inviable and viable NPCs that were previously studied experimentally. The obtained density distributions show that the maximum density of the FG-nups inside the pore does not exceed 185 mg/mL in the inviable NPCs, whereas for the wild-type and viable NPCs, this value increases to 300 mg/mL. Interestingly, this maximum density is not correlated to the total mass of the FG-nups, but depends sensitively on the specific combination of essential Nups located in the central plane of the NPC.",

We show that despite these variations, HMG-D and ZmHMGB1 exist in dynamic assemblies in which the basic HMG boxes and linkers associate with their intrinsically disordered, predominantly acidic, tails in a manner analogous to that observed previously for HMGB1. The DNA-binding surfaces of the boxes and linkers are occluded in “auto-inhibited” forms of the protein, which are in equilibrium with transient, more open structures that are “binding-competent.” This strongly suggests that the mechanism of auto-inhibition may be a general one. HMG-D and ZmHMGB1 differ from HMGB1 in having phosphorylation sites in their tail and linker regions. In both cases, in vitro phosphorylation of serine residues within the acidic tail stabilizes the assembled form, suggesting another level of regulation for interaction with DNA, chromatin, and other proteins that is not possible for the uniformly acidic (hence unphosphorylatable) tail of HMGB1.",Chromatin;Intrinsically Disordered Protein;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR);Phosphorylation;Protein Kinase C (PKC);HMGB Protein;Acidic Regulatory Domain;Casein Kinase 2 (CK2);Paramagnetic Relaxation Enhancement;Protein Kinase C

LMO2 is made up of two LIM only domains (thus it is a LIM-only protein) and forms a bridge in a multi-protein complex. We have studied the mechanism of formation of this complex using a single domain antibody fragment that inhibits LMO2 by sequestering it in a non-functional form. The crystal structure of LMO2 with this antibody fragment has been solved revealing a conformational difference in the positioning and angle between the two LIM domains compared with its normal binding. This contortion occurs by bending at a central helical region of LMO2. This is a unique mechanism for inhibiting an intracellular protein function and the structural contusion implies a model in which newly synthesized, intrinsically disordered LMO2 binds to a partner protein nucleating further interactions and suggests approaches for therapeutic targeting of LMO2.",

We employed a Bayesian network (BN) analysis of HEV3 and HEV4 to detect epistatic connectivity among protein sites and its association with the host specificity in each genotype. The data imply coevolution among ∼70% of polymorphic sites from all HEV proteins and association of numerous coevolving sites with adaptation to swine or humans. BN models for individual proteins and domains of the nonstructural polyprotein detected the host origin of HEV strains with accuracy of 74–93% and 63–87%, respectively. These findings, taken together with lack of phylogenetic association to host, suggest that the HEV host specificity is a heritable and convergent phenotypic trait achievable through variety of genetic pathways (abundance), and explain a broad host range for HEV3 and HEV4.",Hepatitis E virus;Prediction;HEV ORFs;Adaptation;Bayesian network;Coevolution

Therefore, in the high-dimensional conformation space of a protein, the energy landscape is locally relatively flat, in contrast to low-dimensional representations, where, because of the induced entropic contribution to the full free energy, it appears funnel-like. Proteins explore the conformation space by searching these flat subspaces to find a narrow energetic alley that we call a hypergutter and then explore the next, lower-dimensional, subspace. Such a framework provides an effective representation of the energy landscape and folding kinetics that does justice to the essential characteristic of high-dimensionality of the search-space. It also illuminates the important role of nonnative interactions in defining folding pathways. This principle is here illustrated using a coarse-grained model of a family of three-helix bundle proteins whose conformations, once secondary structure has formed, can be defined by six rotational degrees of freedom. Two folding mechanisms are possible, one of which involves an intermediate. The stabilization of intermediate subspaces (or states in low-dimensional projection) in protein folding can either speed up or slow down the folding rate depending on the amount of native and nonnative contacts made in those subspaces. The folding rate increases due to reduced-dimension pathways arising from the mere presence of intermediate states, but decreases if the contacts in the intermediate are very stable and introduce sizeable topological or energetic frustration that needs to be overcome. Remarkably, the hypergutter framework, although depending on just a few physically meaningful parameters, can reproduce all the types of experimentally observed curvature in chevron plots for realizations of this fold.",

at 37 °C until an optical density (OD600) of 0.6 had
been reached and then incubated at 18 °C until an OD600 of 0.7 had been reached. Overexpression was induced by adding 0.5

They function by suppressing the expression of target mRNAs through the recruitment of effector complexes, which include the CCR4–NOT deadenylase complex. Here, we show that the three human Nanos paralogs (Nanos1–3) interact with the CNOT1 C-terminal domain and determine the structural basis for the specific molecular recognition. Nanos1–3 bind CNOT1 through a short CNOT1-interacting motif (NIM) that is conserved in all vertebrates and some invertebrate species. The crystal structure of the human Nanos1 NIM peptide bound to CNOT1 reveals that the peptide opens a conserved hydrophobic pocket on the CNOT1 surface by inserting conserved aromatic residues. The substitutions of these aromatic residues in the Nanos1–3 NIMs abolish binding to CNOT1 and abrogate the ability of the proteins to repress translation. Our findings provide the structural basis for the recruitment of the CCR4–NOT complex by vertebrate Nanos, indicate that the NIMs are the major determinants of the translational repression mediated by Nanos, and identify the CCR4–NOT complex as the main effector complex for Nanos function.",deadenylation;decapping;mRNA decay;SLiM;translational repression

The remaining aqueous space may be further partitioned by the regulated assembly of discrete ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes that contain particular proteins and messenger RNAs. These RNP granules are conserved structures whose importance is highlighted by studies linking them to human disorders like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, relatively little is known about the diversity, composition, and physiological roles of these cytoplasmic structures. To begin to address these issues, we examined the cytoplasmic granules formed by a key set of signaling molecules, the protein kinases of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Interestingly, a significant fraction of these proteins, almost 20%, was recruited to cytoplasmic foci specifically as cells entered into the G0-like quiescent state, stationary phase. Colocalization studies demonstrated that these foci corresponded to eight different granules, including four that had not been reported previously. All of these granules were found to rapidly disassemble upon the resumption of growth, and the presence of each was correlated with cell viability in the quiescent cultures. Finally, this work also identified new constituents of known RNP granules, including the well-characterized processing body and stress granule. The composition of these latter structures is therefore more varied than previously thought and could be an indicator of additional biological activities being associated with these complexes. Altogether, these observations indicate that quiescent yeast cells contain multiple distinct cytoplasmic granules that may make important contributions to their long-term survival.",P-bodies;stress granules;stationary phase;ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules;protein kinases

Despite sharing a high level of homology and the ability to activate PI3K, only Irs-2 positively regulates aerobic glycolysis in mammary tumor cells. To determine the contribution of Irs-2-dependent PI3K signaling to this selective regulation, we generated an Irs-2 mutant deficient in the recruitment of PI3K. We identified four tyrosine residues (Tyr-649, Tyr-671, Tyr-734, and Tyr-814) that are essential for the association of PI3K with Irs-2 and demonstrate that combined mutation of these tyrosines inhibits glucose uptake and lactate production, two measures of aerobic glycolysis. Irs-2-dependent activation of PI3K regulates the phosphorylation of specific Akt substrates, most notably glycogen synthase kinase 3β (Gsk-3β). Inhibition of Gsk-3β by Irs-2-dependent PI3K signaling promotes glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis. The regulation of unique subsets of Akt substrates by Irs-1 and Irs-2 may explain their non-redundant roles in mammary tumor biology.

In this article, we develop a tool that combines SAXS data with a previously developed sampling technique called amplified collective motions (ACM) to elucidate structures of highly dynamic multidomain proteins in solution. We demonstrate the use of this tool in two proteins, bacteriophage T4 lysozyme and tandem WW domains of the formin-binding protein 21.

Currently, there is no clear picture of the overall structure formed by this collection of proteins within the pore, primarily due to their disordered nature. We perform coarse-grained simulations of both individual nucleoporins and grafted rings of nups mimicking the in vivo geometry of the NPC and supplement this with polymer brush modeling. Our results indicate that different regions or blocks of an individual NPC protein can have distinctly different forms of disorder and that this property appears to be a conserved functional feature. Furthermore, this block structure at the individual protein level is critical to the formation of a unique higher-order polymer brush architecture that can exist in distinct morphologies depending on the effective interaction energy between the phenylalanine glycine (FG) domains of different nups. Because the interactions between FG domains may be modulated by certain forms of transport factors, our results indicate that transitions between brush morphologies could play an important role in regulating transport across the NPC, suggesting novel forms of gated transport across membrane pores with wide biomimetic applicability.",

Since such partially denatured proteins are prone to aggregate, cells have evolved several elaborate quality control systems to deal with these potentially toxic proteins. First, various molecular chaperones will seize the misfolded protein and either attempt to refold the protein or target it for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The degradation of misfolded proteins is clearly compartmentalized, so unique degradation pathways exist for misfolded proteins depending on whether their subcellular localization is ER/secretory, mitochondrial, cytosolic or nuclear. Recent studies, mainly in yeast, have shown that the nucleus appears to be particularly active in protein quality control. Thus, specific ubiquitin-protein ligases located in the nucleus, target not only misfolded nuclear proteins, but also various misfolded cytosolic proteins which are transported to the nucleus prior to their degradation. In comparison, much less is known about these mechanisms in mammalian cells. Here we highlight recent advances in our understanding of nuclear protein quality control, in particular regarding substrate recognition and proteasomal degradation.",ubiquitin;degradation;chaperone;proteasome;misfolding;stress;SUMO

Recent studies have revealed the structure and orientation of the N- and C-terminus of LRAP bound to hydroxyapatite (HAP), a surface used as an analog of enamel. The structure of one region, K24 to S28, was found to be sensitive to phosphorylation of S16, the only naturally observed site of serine phosphorylation in LRAP, suggesting that K24S28 may sit at a key region of structural flexibility and play a role in the protein's function. In this work, we investigated the sensitivity of the structure and orientation of this region when bound to HAP as a function of several factors which may vary during enamel formation to influence structure: the ionic strength (0.05, 0.15, 0.2 M), the calcium concentration (0.07 and 0.4 mM), and the surface to which it is binding [HAP and carbonated apatite (CAP), a more direct mimic of enamel]. A naturally occurring mutation found in amelogenin (T21I) was also investigated. The structure in the K24S28 region of the protein was found to be sensitive to these conditions, with the CAP surface and excess Ca2+ (8:1 [Ca2+]:[LRAP-K24S28(+P)]) resulting in a tighter helix, while low ionic strength relaxed the helical structure. Higher ionic strength and the point mutation did not result in any structural change in this region. The distance of the backbone of K24 from the surface was most sensitive to excess Ca2+ and in the T21I-mutation. Collectively, these data suggest that phosphorylated LRAP is able to accommodate structural changes while maintaining its interaction with the surface, and provides further evidence of the structural sensitivity of the K24S28 region, a sensitivity that may contribute to function in biomineralization.",amelogenin;LRAP;secondary structure;biomineralization protein;solid state NMR

As structural disordered disposition in the protein may induce the side-effect and reduce the occupancy for ligand to bind with target protein, PONDR-Fit protocol was performed to predict the disordered disposition in TRAF6 protein before virtual screening. TCM compounds from the TCM Database@Taiwan were employed for virtual screening to identify potent compounds as lead compounds of TRAF6 inhibitor.

However, the docking pose of TRAF6 protein with tryptophan is not stable under dynamic condition. For the other two TCM candidates, diiodotyrosine and saussureamine C maintain the similar docking poses under dynamic conditions.

GR-RBPs are bipartite proteins containing a RNA recognition motif (RRM) followed by a glycine-rich region. Here, we studied the structural basis of nucleic acid binding of full-length Nicotiana tabacum GR-RBP1. NMR studies of NtGR-RBP1 show that the glycine-rich domain, while intrinsically disordered, is responsible for mediating self-association by transient interactions with its RRM domain (NtRRM). Both NtGR-RBP1 and NtRRM bind specifically and with low micromolar affinity to RNA and single-stranded DNA. The solution structure of NtRRM shows that it is a canonical RRM domain. A HADDOCK model of the NtRRM–RNA complex, based on NMR chemical shift and NOE data, shows that nucleic acid binding results from a combination of stacking and electrostatic interactions with conserved RRM residues. Finally, DNA melting experiments demonstrate that NtGR-RBP1 is more efficient in melting CTG containing nucleic acids than isolated NtRRM. Together, our study supports the model that self-association of GR-RBPs by the glycine-rich region results in cooperative unfolding of non-native substrate structures, thereby enhancing its chaperone function.",

That is, observed relaxation times are not simply proportional to the solvent viscosity as might be expected if the solvent were the only source of friction. However, a molecular interpretation of this remarkable phenomenon is currently lacking. Here, we use all-atom simulations of peptide and protein folding in explicit solvent, to probe the origin of the unusual viscosity dependence. We find that an important contribution to this effect, explaining the viscosity dependence of helix formation and the folding of a helix-containing protein, is the insensitivity of torsion angle isomerization to solvent friction. The influence of this landscape roughness can, in turn, be quantitatively explained by a rate theory including memory friction. This insensitivity of local barrier crossing to solvent friction is expected to contribute to the viscosity dependence of folding rates in larger proteins.",

Although Toc159 is known to be a receptor for specific preprotein TPs at the chloroplast surface, the mechanism for its own targeting and integration into the chloroplast outer membrane is not completely understood. In a previous study, we identified a novel TP-like sorting signal at the C-terminus (CT) of a Toc159 homolog from the single-cell C4 species, Bienertia sinuspersici. In the current study, we have extended our understanding of the sorting signal using transient expression of fluorescently-tagged fusion proteins of variable-length, and with truncated and swapped versions of the CT. As was shown in the earlier study, the 56 residues of the CT contain crucial sorting information for reversible interaction of the receptor with the chloroplast envelope. Extension of this region to 100 residues in the current study stabilized the interaction via membrane integration, as demonstrated by more prominent plastid-associated signals and resistance of the fusion protein to alkaline extraction. Despite a high degree of sequence similarity, the plastid localization signals of the equivalent CT regions of Arabidopsis thaliana Toc159 homologs were not as strong as that of the B. sinuspersici counterparts. Together with computational and circular dichroism analyses of the CT domain structures, our data provide insights into the critical elements of the CT for the efficient targeting and anchorage of Toc159 receptors to the dimorphic chloroplasts in the single-cell C4 species.",Bienertia sinuspersici;Toc159;outer envelope protein;transit peptide;plastid;dimorphic chloroplast;translocon;protein targeting

Mia40 accelerates Cox19 folding through the specific recognition of the third Cys in the second helical CX9C motif and the subsequent oxidation of the inner disulfide bond. This renders a native-like intermediate that oxidizes in a slow uncatalyzed reaction into native Cox19. The same intermediate dominates the pathway in the absence of Mia40, and chemical induction of an α-helical structure by trifluoroethanol suffices to accelerate productive folding and mimic the Mia40 folding template mechanism.

Although several genomic features have been associated with organism complexity, in the case of alternative splicing, which has long been proposed to explain the variation in complexity, no such link has been established. Here, we analyzed over 39 million expressed sequence tags available for 47 eukaryotic species with fully sequenced genomes to obtain a comparable index of alternative splicing estimates, which corrects for the distorting effect of a variable number of transcripts per species—an important obstacle for comparative studies of alternative splicing. We find that alternative splicing has steadily increased over the last 1,400 My of eukaryotic evolution and is strongly associated with organism complexity, assayed as the number of cell types. Importantly, this association is not explained as a by-product of covariance between alternative splicing with other variables previously linked to complexity including gene content, protein length, proteome disorder, and protein interactivity. In addition, we found no evidence to suggest that the relationship of alternative splicing to cell type number is explained by drift due to reduced Ne in more complex species. Taken together, our results firmly establish alternative splicing as a significant predictor of organism complexity and are, in principle, consistent with an important role of transcript diversification through alternative splicing as a means of determining a genome’s functional information capacity.",organism complexity;alternative splicing;genome evolution;transcriptome evolution;expressed sequence tags

CyaA is able to invade eukaryotic target cells in which it produces high levels of cAMP, thus altering the cellular physiology. Although CyaA has been extensively studied by various cellular and molecular approaches, the structural and functional states of the toxin remain poorly characterized. Indeed, CyaA is a large protein and exhibits a pronounced hydrophobic character, making it prone to aggregation into multimeric forms. As a result, CyaA has usually been extracted and stored in denaturing conditions. Here, we define the experimental conditions allowing CyaA folding into a monomeric and functional species. We found that CyaA forms mainly multimers when refolded by dialysis, dilution, or buffer exchange. However, a significant fraction of monomeric, folded protein could be obtained by exploiting molecular confinement on size exclusion chromatography. Folding of CyaA into a monomeric form was found to be critically dependent upon the presence of calcium and post-translational acylation of the protein. We further show that the monomeric preparation displayed hemolytic and cytotoxic activities suggesting that the monomer is the genuine, physiologically active form of the toxin.

Thus, cellular processes can be emulated in artificial systems and their molecular basis studied by adding cellular components one at a time in a well-controlled environment while the resulting structures, or structural changes in response to external cues, are monitored with neutron reflection. In recent years, sample environments, data collection strategies and data analysis were continuously refined. The combination of these improvements increases the information which can be obtained from NR to an extent that enables structural characterization of protein-membrane complexes at a length scale that exceeds the resolution of the measurement by far.

Despite the diversity of available computational methods in the literature, none has proven accurate and dependable on its own under all scenarios where mutation analysis is required. Here we present DUET, a web server for an integrated computational approach to study missense mutations in proteins. DUET consolidates two complementary approaches (mCSM and SDM) in a consensus prediction, obtained by combining the results of the separate methods in an optimized predictor using Support Vector Machines (SVM). We demonstrate that the proposed method improves overall accuracy of the predictions in comparison with either method individually and performs as well as or better than similar methods.

post-translational modifications of serine and threonine.2 We found opposing structural effects of phosphorylation
and OGlcNAcylation in proline-rich sequences, which are among the
most common sequences in eukaryotes,1 but
similar effects of both modifications in opposing the unmodified hydroxyl
in sequences with a nascent α-helix. These data provide a plausible
structural basis for the observation that OGlcNAcylation of tau opposes
neurofibrillary tangle formation, because of its confirmation of the
disordered structure of sequences with unmodified serine and threonine
residues, while phosphorylation is associated with neurofibrillary
tangle formation, potentially because of a disorder to order transition
that promotes opening of the global hairpin conformation of tau. More
generally, these data provide a context for interpreting sequence-specific
structural effects of these post-translational modifications, with
broad potential application to understanding the intracellular effects
of phosphorylation and OGlcNAcylation. Across all peptides, dianionic
phosphoserine and dianionic phosphothreonine adopted ordered structures,
including induction of polyproline helix. We found particular conformational
restriction in phosphothreonine residues, with a highly ordered structure
adopted. Notably, phosphoproteomics experiments have revealed that
over 25% of phosphorylation sites are at Ser-Pro or Thr-Pro sequences,
suggesting that the results observed herein in tau peptides and in
proline-rich model peptides may have broad applicability in understanding
the effects of phosphorylation on protein structure, particularly

We characterized the ssDNA-binding properties of Klebsiella pneumoniae SSB (KpSSB), Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium LT2 SSB (StSSB), Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 SSB (PaSSB), and two chimeric KpSSB proteins, namely, KpSSBnStSSBc and KpSSBnPaSSBc. The C-terminal domain of StSSB or PaSSB was exchanged with that of KpSSB through protein chimeragenesis. By using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we characterized the stoichiometry of KpSSB, StSSB, PaSSB, KpSSBnStSSBc, and KpSSBnPaSSBc, complexed with a series of ssDNA homopolymers. The binding site sizes were determined to be 26 ± 2, 21 ± 2, 29 ± 2, 21 ± 2, and 29 ± 2 nucleotides (nt), respectively. Comparison of the binding site sizes of KpSSB, KpSSBnStSSBc, and KpSSBnPaSSBc showed that the C-terminal domain swapping of SSB changes the size of the binding site.

The near-infrared fluorescent proteins have allowed bioimaging of deep tissues and whole organs noninvasively in living animals. BphPs and derived near-infrared fluorescent proteins contain a structural element, called knot, in their polypeptide chains. Formation of knot structures in proteins was denied for a long time. Here, we studied denaturation and renaturation processes of the near-infrared fluorescent probe, iRFP engineered from RpBphP2, which utilizes a heme-derived tetrapyrrole compound biliverdin as a chromophore. iRFP contains a unique figure-of-eight knot. The denaturation and renaturation curves of the iRFP apoform coincided well, suggesting its efficient refolding. However, the iRFP holoform exhibited the irreversible unfolding and aggregation, associated with the bound chromophore. The knot structure in the apoform did not prevent its subsequent binding of biliverdin, resulting in the functional iRFP holoform. We suggest that the irreversibility of protein unfolding is caused by posttranslational protein modifications, such as chromophore binding, rather than the presence of the knot.

Here, through a comprehensive proteomic survey of mRNP assembly, we demonstrate that the SUMO pathway specifically controls the association of the THO complex with mRNPs. We further show that the THO complex, a key player in the interplay between gene expression, mRNA export and genetic stability, is sumoylated on its Hpr1 subunit and that this modification regulates its association with mRNPs. Altered recruitment of the THO complex onto mRNPs in sumoylation-defective mutants does not affect bulk mRNA export or genetic stability, but impairs the expression of acidic stress-induced genes and, consistently, compromises viability in acidic stress conditions. Importantly, inactivation of the nuclear exosome suppresses the phenotypes of the hpr1 non-sumoylatable mutant, showing that SUMO-dependent mRNP assembly is critical to allow a specific subset of mRNPs to escape degradation. This article thus provides the first example of a SUMO-dependent mRNP-assembly event allowing a refined tuning of gene expression, in particular under specific stress conditions.",

CTA1 then unfolds and passes through an ER translocon pore to reach its cytosolic target. Due to its intrinsic instability, cytosolic CTA1 must be refolded to achieve an active conformation. The cytosolic chaperone Hsp90 is involved with the ER to cytosol export of CTA1, but the mechanistic role of Hsp90 in CTA1 translocation remains unknown. Moreover, potential post-translocation roles for Hsp90 in modulating the activity of cytosolic CTA1 have not been explored. Here, we show by isotope-edited Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy that Hsp90 induces a gain-of-structure in disordered CTA1 at physiological temperature. Only the ATP-bound form of Hsp90 interacts with disordered CTA1, and refolding of CTA1 by Hsp90 is dependent upon ATP hydrolysis. In vitro reconstitution of the CTA1 translocation event likewise required ATP hydrolysis by Hsp90. Surface plasmon resonance experiments found that Hsp90 does not release CTA1, even after ATP hydrolysis and the return of CTA1 to a folded conformation. The interaction with Hsp90 allows disordered CTA1 to attain an active state, which is further enhanced by ADP-ribosylation factor 6, a host cofactor for CTA1. Our data indicate CTA1 translocation involves a process that couples the Hsp90-mediated refolding of CTA1 with CTA1 extraction from the ER. The molecular basis for toxin translocation elucidated in this study may also apply to several ADP-ribosylating toxins that move from the endosomes to the cytosol in an Hsp90-dependent process.",Cholera Toxin;Fourier Transform IR (FTIR);Heat Shock Protein 90 (Hsp90);Host-pathogen Interaction;Protein Translocation;Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)

Both neuronal and non-neuronal functions of the methyl-binding protein underlie the related pathologies. Nowadays MeCP2 is recognized as a multifunctional protein that modulates its activity depending on its protein partners and posttranslational modifications. However, we are still missing a comprehensive understanding of all MeCP2 functions and their involvement in the related pathologies. The study of human mutations often offers the possibility of clarifying the functions of a protein. Therefore, we decided to characterize a novel MeCP2 phospho-isoform (Tyr-120) whose relevance was suggested by a Rett syndrome patient carrying a Y120D substitution possibly mimicking a constitutively phosphorylated state. Unexpectedly, we found MeCP2 and its Tyr-120 phospho-isoform enriched at the centrosome both in dividing and postmitotic cells. The molecular and functional connection of MeCP2 to the centrosome was further reinforced through cellular and biochemical approaches. We show that, similar to many centrosomal proteins, MeCP2 deficiency causes aberrant spindle geometry, prolonged mitosis, and defects in microtubule nucleation.

After synthesis in the cytoplasm, over a third of all proteins are targeted to other subcellular compartments. Knowing how proteins are distributed within the cell and how they interact is a prerequisite for understanding it as a whole. Surface and secreted proteins are important pathogenicity determinants. Here we present the STEP database (STEPdb) that contains a comprehensive characterization of subcellular localization and topology of the complete proteome of Escherichia coli. Two widely used E. coli proteomes (K-12 and BL21) are presented organized into thirteen subcellular classes. STEPdb exploits the wealth of genetic, proteomic, biochemical, and functional information on protein localization, secretion, and targeting in E. coli, one of the best understood model organisms. Subcellular annotations were derived from a combination of bioinformatics prediction, proteomic, biochemical, functional, topological data and extensive literature re-examination that were refined through manual curation. Strong experimental support for the location of 1553 out of 4303 proteins was based on 426 articles and some experimental indications for another 526. Annotations were provided for another 320 proteins based on firm bioinformatic predictions. STEPdb is the first database that contains an extensive set of peripheral IM proteins (PIM proteins) and includes their graphical visualization into complexes, cellular functions, and interactions. It also summarizes all currently known protein export machineries of E. coli K-12 and pairs them, where available, with the secretory proteins that use them. It catalogs the Sec- and TAT-utilizing secretomes and summarizes their topological features such as signal peptides and transmembrane regions, transmembrane topologies and orientations. It also catalogs physicochemical and structural features that influence topology such as abundance, solubility, disorder, heat resistance, and structural domain families. Finally, STEPdb incorporates prediction tools for topology (TMHMM, SignalP, and Phobius) and disorder (IUPred) and implements the BLAST2STEP that performs protein homology searches against the STEPdb.",

It serves as an adaptor that binds both dynein and cargoes and enhances single-motor processivity. The dynactin subunit dynamitin (also known as p50) is believed to be integral to dynactin structure because free dynamitin displaces the dynein-binding p150Glued subunit from the cargo-binding Arp1 filament. We show here that the intrinsically disordered dynamitin N-terminus binds to Arp1 directly. When expressed in cells, dynamitin amino acids (AA) 1–87 causes complete release of endogenous dynamitin, p150, and p24 from dynactin, leaving behind Arp1 filaments carrying the remaining dynactin subunits (CapZ, p62, Arp11, p27, and p25). Tandem-affinity purification–tagged dynamitin AA 1–87 binds the Arp filament specifically, and binding studies with purified native Arp1 reveal that this fragment binds Arp1 directly. Neither CapZ nor the p27/p25 dimer contributes to interactions between dynamitin and the Arp filament. This work demonstrates for the first time that Arp1 can directly bind any protein besides another Arp and provides important new insight into the underpinnings of dynactin structure.",

Inhibition of TREM-1 by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in macrophages suppresses cancer cell invasion in vitro. In the clinical setting, high levels of TREM-1 expression on tumor-associated macrophages are associated with cancer recurrence and poor survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). TREM-1 upregulation on peritoneal neutrophils has been found in human sepsis patients and in mice with experimental lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock. However, the precise function of TREM-1 and the nature of its ligand are not yet known. In this study, we used the signaling chain homooligomerization (SCHOOL) model of immune signaling to design a novel, ligand-independent peptide-based TREM-1 inhibitor and demonstrated that this peptide specifically silences TREM-1 signaling in vitro and in vivo. Utilizing two human lung tumor xenograft nude mouse models (H292 and A549) and mice with LPS-induced sepsis, we show for the first time that blockade of TREM-1 function using non-toxic and non-immunogenic SCHOOL peptide inhibitors: 1) delays tumor growth in xenograft models of human NSCLC, 2) prolongs survival of mice with LPS-induced septic shock, and 3) substantially decreases cytokine production in vitro and in vivo. In addition, targeted delivery of SCHOOL peptides to macrophages utilizing lipoprotein-mimicking nanoparticles significantly increased peptide half-life and dosage efficacy. Together, the results suggest that ligand-independent modulation of TREM-1 function using small synthetic peptides might be a suitable treatment for sepsis and NSCLC and possibly other types of inflammation-associated disorders.",Macrophage;TREM-1 receptor;SCHOOL model of cell signaling;therapeutic peptides;non-small cell lung cancer;sepsis;nanoparticles;targeted delivery

However, its role as a seldom-mutated transcription factor, its lack of enzymatic activity for which suitable pharmaceutical inhibitors could be crafted and its expression by normal cells have largely been responsible for its being viewed as “undruggable”. Work over the past several years, however, has begun to reverse this idea by allowing us to view Myc within the larger context of global gene regulatory control. Thus, Myc and its obligate heterodimeric partner, Max, are integral to the coordinated recruitment and post-translational modification of components of the core transcriptional machinery. Moreover, Myc over-expression re-programs numerous critical cellular functions and alters the cell’s susceptibility to their inhibition. This new knowledge has therefore served as a framework upon which to develop new pharmaceutical approaches. These include the continuing development of small molecules which act directly to inhibit the critical Myc-Max interaction, those which act indirectly to prevent Myc-directed post-translational modifications necessary to initiate productive transcription and those which inhibit vital pathways upon which the Myc-transformed cell is particularly reliant.",

Furthermore, given that autotransporter assembly is inherently more complicated than the assembly of generic β barrel proteins, it is conceivable that the Bam complex exists in a distinctive oligomeric state during its interaction with autotransporters. To determine whether a single copy of the Bam complex can mediate the assembly of EspP derivatives, we reconstituted BamABCDE into ∼10–12 nm nanodiscs using conditions that facilitate the incorporation of a single copy of the ABC transporter MalFGK2 (Bao et al., 2012). The nanodiscs eluted at about the same position on gel filtration columns as BamABCDE monomers (Figure 8A). Analysis of the peak fractions by SDS-PAGE suggested that the scaffold protein MSP1D1 was present in excess over the Bam complex proteins (Figure 8B). Because nanodiscs are stabilized by two copies of the scaffold protein (Denisov et al., 2004), however, this observation is consistent with the prediction that they contained a single copy of the Bam complex. In addition, the nanodiscs produced a single band on Blue Native PAGE that migrated only slightly slower than a BamABCDE monomer (compare Figure 8C to Figure 1C). Western blot analysis using the anti-EspP C-terminal antiserum revealed that both EspP(46+β) and EspP(HA-251+β) were assembled into nanodiscs about as efficiently as they were assembled into proteoliposomes (Figure 8D). Although the non-vesicular nature of nanodiscs precluded assessment of passenger domain translocation using a PK-sensitivity assay, we found that the ∼30 kDa passenger domain of EspP(HA-251+β) accumulated in parallel with the cleaved β domain (Figure 8E). These results not only provide evidence that a Bam complex monomer is sufficient to catalyze autotransporter assembly, but also show that the curvature of the proteoliposome membrane is not itself required for the assembly process.",E. coli

We find that both proteins bind to GroEL with high affinity in a reaction involving substantial conformational adaptation. However, whereas the compact denatured state of rhodanese is encapsulated efficiently upon addition of GroES and ATP, the more expanded and unstructured denatured cyclophilin A is not encapsulated but is expelled into solution. The origin of this surprising disparity is the weaker interactions of cyclophilin A with a transiently formed GroEL-GroES complex, which may serve as a crucial checkpoint for substrate discrimination.",

However, recent evidence points toward a selective mode of autophagy mediated by the so-called selective autophagy receptors (SARs). SARs act by recognizing and sorting diverse cargo substrates (e.g., proteins, organelles, pathogens) to the autophagic machinery. Known SARs are characterized by a short linear sequence motif (LIR-, LRS-, or AIM-motif) responsible for the interaction between SARs and proteins of the Atg8 family. Interestingly, many LIR-containing proteins (LIRCPs) are also involved in autophagosome formation and maturation and a few of them in regulating signaling pathways. Despite recent research efforts to experimentally identify LIRCPs, only a few dozen of this class of—often unrelated—proteins have been characterized so far using tedious cell biological, biochemical, and crystallographic approaches. The availability of an ever-increasing number of complete eukaryotic genomes provides a grand challenge for characterizing novel LIRCPs throughout the eukaryotes. Along these lines, we developed iLIR, a freely available web resource, which provides in silico tools for assisting the identification of novel LIRCPs. Given an amino acid sequence as input, iLIR searches for instances of short sequences compliant with a refined sensitive regular expression pattern of the extended LIR motif (xLIR-motif) and retrieves characterized protein domains from the SMART database for the query. Additionally, iLIR scores xLIRs against a custom position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) and identifies potentially disordered subsequences with protein interaction potential overlapping with detected xLIR-motifs. Here we demonstrate that proteins satisfying these criteria make good LIRCP candidates for further experimental verification. Domain architecture is displayed in an informative graphic, and detailed results are also available in tabular form. We anticipate that iLIR will assist with elucidating the full complement of LIRCPs in eukaryotes.",macroautophagy;selective autophagy;LC3 interacting region-motif;Atg8-family interacting proteins;web server;prediction

Evidence from animal models has implicated SK/IK channels in neurological conditions such as ataxia and alcohol use disorders. Further, genome-wide association studies have suggested that cardiovascular abnormalities such as arrhythmias and hypertension are associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms that occur within the genes encoding the SK/IK channels. The Ca2+ sensitivity of the SK/IK channels stems from a constitutively bound Ca2+-binding protein: calmodulin. Small-molecule positive modulators of SK/IK channels have been developed over the past decade, and recent structural studies have revealed that the binding pocket of these positive modulators is located at the interface between the channel and calmodulin. SK/IK channel positive modulators can potentiate channel activity by enhancing the coupling between Ca2+ sensing via calmodulin and mechanical opening of the channel. Here, we review binding pocket studies that have provided structural insight into the mechanism of action for SK/IK channel positive modulators.

Proteolytic fragments from Pmel17 form fibrils upon which melanin is deposited in melanosomes. The repeat domain (RPT) derived from Pmel17 only forms fibrils under acidic melanosomal conditions. Here, we examined the effects of lipids on RPT aggregation to explore whether intramelanosomal vesicles can facilitate fibrillogenesis. Using transmission electron microscopy, circular dichroism, and fluorescence spectroscopy, fibril formation was monitored at the ultrastructural, secondary conformational and local level, respectively. Phospholipid vesicles and lysophospholipid (lysolipid) micelles were employed as membrane mimics. The surfactant-like lysolipids are particularly pertinent due to their high content in melanosomal membranes. Interestingly, RPT aggregation kinetics were influenced only by lysolipid-containing phospholipid vesicles. While both vesicles containing either anionic lysophosphatidylglycerol (LPG) or zwitterionic lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) stimulate aggregation, LPG exerted a greater effect on reducing the apparent nucleation time. A detailed comparison showed distinct behaviors of LPG versus LPC monomers and micelles plausibly originating from their headgroup hydrogen bonding capabilities. Acceleration and retardation of aggregation were observed for LPG monomers and micelles, respectively. Because a specific interaction between LPG and RPT was identified by intrinsic W423 fluorescence and induced α-helical structure, it is inferred that binding of LPG near the C-terminal amyloid core initiates intermolecular association, whereas stabilization of α-helical conformation inhibits β-sheet formation. Contrastingly, LPC promotes RPT aggregation at both submicellar and micellar concentrations via non-specific binding with undetectable secondary structural change. Our findings suggest that protein-lysolipid interactions within melanosomes may regulate amyloid formation in vivo.",melanosome;protein-lipid interaction;tryptophan;TEM;lysolipids

Differential RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to explore the specificities of its transcriptome. Strikingly, for 1,174 (60%) mRNAs, the transcription start site was found exactly at (916 cases, 47%) or very close to the translation initiation codon AUG or GUG. Such proportion of leaderless mRNAs, which may resemble ancestral mRNAs, is unprecedented for a bacterial species. Proteomics showed that leaderless mRNAs are efficiently translated in D. deserti. Interestingly, we also found 173 additional transcripts with a 5′-AUG or 5′-GUG that would make them competent for ribosome binding and translation into novel small polypeptides. Fourteen of these are predicted to be leader peptides involved in transcription attenuation. Another 30 correlated with new gene predictions and/or showed conservation with annotated and nonannotated genes in other Deinococcus species, and five of these novel polypeptides were indeed detected by mass spectrometry. The data also allowed reannotation of the start codon position of 257 genes, including several DNA repair genes. Moreover, several novel highly radiation-induced genes were found, and their potential roles are discussed. On the basis of our RNA-seq and proteogenomics data, we propose that translation of many of the novel leaderless transcripts, which may have resulted from single-nucleotide changes and maintained by selective pressure, provides a new explanation for the generation of a cellular pool of small peptides important for protection of proteins against oxidation and thus for radiation/desiccation tolerance and adaptation to harsh environmental conditions.",protein translation initiation;genome evolution;small peptides;desiccation tolerance;protein protection;transcription start sites

Here, to address these questions, we use a robust β-barrel channel, α-hemolysin, reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers. Transient, ∼95% blockage of the channel current by α-syn was observed when 1), α-syn was added from the membrane side where the shorter (stem) part of the channel is exposed; and 2), the applied potential was lower on the side of α-syn addition. While the on-rate of α-syn binding to the channel strongly increased with the applied field, the off-rate displayed a turnover behavior. Statistical analysis suggests that at voltages >50 mV, a significant fraction of the α-syn molecules bound to the channel undergoes subsequent translocation. The observed on-rate varied by >100 times depending on the bilayer lipid composition. Removal of the last 25 amino acids from the highly negatively charged C-terminal of α-syn resulted in a significant decrease in the binding rates. Taken together, these results demonstrate that β-barrel channels may serve as sensitive probes of α-syn interactions with membranes as well as model systems for studies of channel-assisted protein transport.",

Notably, significant changes in conformational ensembles can occur upon the binding of a protein to a ligand or partner protein. In the most extreme cases of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), the bulk of folding occurs only on substrate binding. Although some residual structure persists in the unbound conformational ensemble of IDPs (6), recent work has challenged the idea that features present in this residual structure are crucial for the binding mechanism (7). More broadly, several talks and posters throughout the conference delved into the interplay between entropic and enthalpic contributions to protein folding and stability, including kinetic stability (8) and its ability to suppress aggregation (9). Another common theme was the diverse ways that protein structures and folding mechanisms respond to amino acid mutations (10, 11). Building upon this biophysical foundation, other presentations highlighted recent insights into the effects of macromolecular crowding (12), molecular chaperones (13), and other nanomachines on protein-folding mechanisms, protein stability, and the competition between productive protein folding and protein aggregation in vivo.",

We present here a systematic computational study of the role of histone tails in the nucleosome, using replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations with an implicit solvent model and different well-established force fields. We performed simulations for all four histone tails, H4, H3, H2A, and H2B, isolated and with inclusion of the nucleosome. The results confirm predictions of previous theoretical studies for the secondary structure of the isolated tails but show a strong dependence on the force field used. In the presence of the entire nucleosome for all force fields, the secondary structure of the histone tails is destabilized. Specific contacts are found between charged lysine and arginine residues and DNA phosphate groups and other binding sites in the minor and major DNA grooves. Using cluster analysis, we found a single dominant configuration of binding to DNA for the H4 and H2A histone tails, whereas H3 and H2B show multiple binding configurations with an equal probability. The leading stabilizing contribution for those binding configurations is the attractive interaction between the positively charged lysine and arginine residues and the negatively charged phosphate groups, and thus the resulting charge neutralization. Finally, we present results of molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent to confirm our conclusions. Results from both implicit and explicit solvent models show that large portions of the histone tails are not bound to DNA, supporting the complex role of these tails in gene transcription and expression and making them possible candidates for binding sites of transcription factors, enzymes, and other proteins.",

Here, we address the electrostatic and nonpolar properties of ribosomal proteins that are important for ribosome assembly and interaction with other cellular components and may influence protein folding on the ribosome. We examined 50 S ribosomal subunits from 10 species and found a clear distinction between the net charge of ribosomal proteins from halophilic and non-halophilic organisms. We found that ∼67% ribosomal proteins from halophiles are negatively charged, whereas only up to ∼15% of ribosomal proteins from non-halophiles share this property. Conversely, hydrophobicity tends to be lower for ribosomal proteins from halophiles than for the corresponding proteins from non-halophiles. Importantly, the surface electrostatic potential of ribosomal proteins from all organisms, especially halophiles, has distinct positive and negative regions across all the examined species. Positively and negatively charged residues of ribosomal proteins tend to be clustered in buried and solvent-exposed regions, respectively. Hence, the majority of ribosomal proteins is characterized by a significant degree of intramolecular charge segregation, regardless of the organism of origin.

The sub-nuclear localization of Acinus-L and Acinus-S′ was determined using fluorescence microscopy. Acinus-S′ colocalizes with SC35 in nuclear speckles while Acinus-L localizes diffusely throughout the nucleoplasm. RA treatment has little effect on the sub-nuclear localization of Acinus-L and Acinus-S′. The domains/regions necessary for the distinct sub-nuclear localization of Acinus-L and Acinus-S′ were identified. The speckled sub-nuclear localization of Acinus-S′ is dependent on its C-terminal RS- and RD/E-rich region but is independent of the phosphorylation status of Ser-453 and Ser-604 within this region. The unique N-terminal SAP-motif of Acinus-L is responsible for its diffuse localization in the nucleus. Moreover, the sub-nuclear localization of Acinus isoforms is affected by each other, which is determined by the combinatorial effect of the more potent SAP motif of Acinus-L and the C-terminal RS- and RD/E-rich region in all Acinus isoforms. The C-terminal RS- and RD/E-rich region of Acinus mediates the colocalization of Acinus isoforms as well as with its interacting protein RNPS1.

Molecular simulations are poised to more frequently guide the interpretation of biophysical measurements of biomolecular complexes. Ligand design strategies emerge from detailed analyses of computed structural ensembles. The feasibility of routine applications to ligand optimization problems hinges upon successful extensive large scale validation studies and the development of protocols to intelligently automate computations.,

Many plants species are able to cold-acclimate, acquiring higher freezing tolerance upon exposure to low but non-freezing temperatures. Among a plethora of adaptational processes, this involves the accumulation of cold regulated (COR) proteins that are assumed to stabilize and protect cellular structures during freezing. However, their molecular functions are largely unknown. We recently reported a comprehensive study of 2 intrinsically disordered cold regulated chloroplast proteins, COR15A and COR15B from Arabidopsis thaliana. They are necessary for full cold acclimation. During freezing, they stabilize leaf cells through folding and binding to chloroplast membranes. Contrary to evidence from in-vitro experiments, they play no role in enzyme stabilization in vivo. Elucidating these major functional and structural characteristics and estimation of protein abundance allow us to propose a detailed model for the mode of action of the two COR15 proteins.",amphipathic α-helix;cold acclimation;COR protein;freezing temperatures;intrinsically disordered protein;protein-membrane interaction

E-mail: ude.msu@irahcagnar.yajiv","Amyloid aggregates of α-synuclein (αS) protein are the predominant species present within the intracellular inclusions called Lewy bodies in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. Among various aggregates, the low-molecular weight ones broadly ranging between 2 and 30 mers are known to be the primary neurotoxic agents responsible for the impairment of neuronal function. Recent research has indicated that the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) is one of the key physiological agents promoting and augmenting αS aggregation, which is thought to be a significant event in PD pathologenesis. Specifically, DA is known to induce the formation of soluble oligomers of αS, which in turn are responsible for inducing several important cellular changes leading to cellular toxicity. In this report, we present the generation, isolation, and biophysical characterization of five different dopamine-derived αS oligomers (DSOs) ranging between 3 and 15 mers, corroborating previously published reports. More importantly, we establish that these DSOs are also capable of replication by self-propagation, which leads to the replication of DSOs upon interaction with αS monomers, a process similar to that observed in mammilian prions. In addition, DSOs are also able to cross-propagate amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates involved in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Interestingly, while self-propagation of DSOs occur with no net gain in protein structure, cross-propagation proceeds with an overall gain in β-sheet conformation. These results implicate the involvement of DSOs in the progression of PD, and, in part, provide a molecular basis for the observed co-existence of AD-like pathology among PD patients.",α-synuclein;oligomers;propagation;prion;amyloid;Parkinson’s

In this work we investigate this relationship by examining α-synuclein in the presence of a small molecular tweezer, CLR01, which binds selectively to Lys side chains. We find strong binding to multiple Lys within the chain as measured by fluorescence and mass-spectrometry and a linear increase in the reconfiguration rate with concentration of the inhibitor. Top-down mass-spectrometric analysis shows that the main binding of CLR01 to α-synuclein occurs at the N-terminal Lys-10/Lys-12. Photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP) analysis shows that under the conditions used for the fluorescence analysis, α-synuclein is predominantly monomeric. The results can be successfully modeled using a kinetic scheme in which two aggregation-prone monomers can form an encounter complex that leads to further oligomerization but can also dissociate back to monomers if the reconfiguration rate is sufficiently high. Taken together, the data provide important insights into the preferred binding site of CLR01 on α-synuclein and the mechanism by which the molecular tweezer prevents self-assembly into neurotoxic aggregates by α-synuclein and presumably other amyloidogenic proteins.",α-Synuclein;Mass Spectrometry (MS);Parkinson's Disease;Protein Aggregation;Spectroscopy;Inhibitor;Intramolecular Diffusion

One of the possible scenarios suggests that the code evolved in response to direct interactions between peptides and RNA oligonucleotides in the primordial environment. Recently, we have revealed a strong matching between base-binding preferences of modern protein sequences and the composition of their cognate mRNA coding sequences. These results point directly at the physicochemical foundation behind the code’s origin, but also support the possibility of direct complementary interactions between proteins and their cognate mRNAs, especially if the two are unstructured. Here, we analyze molecular-surface mapping of knowledge-based amino-acid/nucleobase interaction preferences for a set of complete, high-resolution protein structures and show that the connection between the two biopolymers could remain relevant even for structured, folded proteins. Specifically, protein surface loops are strongly enriched in residues with a high binding propensity for guanine and cytosine, while adenine- and uracil-preferring residues are uniformly distributed throughout protein structures. Moreover, compositional complementarity of cognate protein and mRNA sequences remains strong even after weighting protein sequence profiles by residue solvent exposure. Our results support the possibility that protein/mRNA sequence complementarity may also translate to cognate interactions between structured biopolymers.",mRNA-cognate protein complementarity;knowledge-based statistical potentials;analysis of protein surfaces;origin of the genetic code

Targets were highly enriched for APC-related functions, including microtubule organization, cell motility, cancer and neurologic disease. Among the targets is β2B-tubulin, known to be required in human neuron and axon migration. We show β2B-tubulin is synthesized in axons and localizes preferentially to dynamic microtubules in the growth cone periphery. APC binds the β2B-tubulin 3'UTR; treatments interfering with this interaction reduced β2B-tubulin mRNA axonal localization and expression, depleted dynamic microtubules and the growth cone periphery, and impaired neuron migration. These results identify APC as a platform binding functionally-related protein and RNA networks, and suggest a self-organizing model for the microtubule to localize synthesis of its own subunits.",

LEM domain (LAP2, emerin, MAN1 domain, LEM-D) proteins are components of the nuclear lamina, identified by a shared ∼45-amino-acid motif that binds Barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF), a chromatin-interacting protein. Drosophila melanogaster has three nuclear lamina LEM-D proteins, named Otefin (Ote), Bocksbeutel (Bocks), and dMAN1. Although these LEM-D proteins are globally expressed, loss of either Ote or dMAN1 causes tissue-specific defects in adult flies that differ from each other. The reason for such distinct tissue-restricted defects is unknown. Here, we generated null alleles of bocks, finding that loss of Bocks causes no overt adult phenotypes. Next, we defined phenotypes associated with lem-d double mutants. Although the absence of individual LEM-D proteins does not affect viability, loss of any two proteins causes lethality. Mutant phenotypes displayed by lem-d double mutants differ from baf mutants, suggesting that BAF function is retained in animals with a single nuclear lamina LEM-D protein. Interestingly, lem-d double mutants displayed distinct developmental and cellular mutant phenotypes, suggesting that Drosophila LEM-D proteins have developmental functions that are differentially shared with other LEM-D family members. This conclusion is supported by studies showing that ectopically produced LEM-D proteins have distinct capacities to rescue the tissue-specific phenotypes found in single lem-d mutants. Our findings predict that cell-specific mutant phenotypes caused by loss of LEM-D proteins reflect both the constellation of LEM-D proteins within the nuclear lamina and the capacity of functional compensation of the remaining LEM-D proteins.",LEM domain;laminopathies;nuclear lamina;Drosophila;germline stem cells

Although the precise mechanisms by which tau contributes to neurodegeneration remain unclear, tau aggregation is commonly considered to be a critical component of tau-mediated pathogenicity. Nevertheless, the context in which tau aggregation begins in vivo is unknown. Tau is enriched in membrane-rich neuronal structures such as axons and growth cones, and can interact with membranes both via intermediary proteins and directly via its microtubule-binding domain (MBD). Membranes efficiently facilitate tau aggregation in vitro, and may therefore provide a physiologically relevant context for nucleating tau aggregation in vivo. Furthermore, tau-membrane interactions may potentially play a role in tau’s poorly understood normal physiological functions. Despite the potential importance of direct tau-membrane interactions for tau pathology and physiology, the structural mechanisms that underlie such interactions remain to be elucidated. Here, we employ electron spin resonance spectroscopy to investigate the secondary and long-range structural properties of the MBD of three-repeat tau isoforms when bound to lipid vesicles and membrane mimetics. We show that the membrane interactions of the tau MBD are mediated by short amphipathic helices formed within each of the MBD repeats in the membrane-bound state. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed elucidation of helical tau structure in the context of intact lipid bilayers. We further show, for the first time (to our knowledge), that these individual helical regions behave as independent membrane-binding sites linked by flexible connecting regions.

One highly conserved hub is a protein called LC8 that was originally identified as an essential component of the multi-subunit complex dynein but later shown to be also critical in multiple protein complexes in diverse systems. What is intriguing about this hub protein is that it does not passively bind its various partners but emerging evidence suggests that LC8 acts as a dimerization engine that promotes self-association and/or higher order organization of its primarily disordered monomeric partners. This structural organization process does not require ATP but is triggered by long-range allosteric regulation initiated by LC8 binding a pair of disordered chains forming a bivalent or polybivalent scaffold. This review focuses on the role of LC8 in promoting self-association of two of its binding partners, a dynein intermediate chain and a non dynein protein called Swallow.",

One of the most important PTMs is the Arg- or Lys-methylation that occurs on arginine or lysine, respectively. Given a protein, which site of its Arg (or Lys) can be methylated, and which site cannot? This is the first important problem for understanding the methylation mechanism and drug development in depth. With the avalanche of protein sequences generated in the postgenomic age, its urgency has become self-evident. To address this problem, we proposed a new predictor, called iMethyl-PseAAC.

Recently, we showed that the INDETERMINATE DOMAIN family proteins serve as transcriptional scaffolds to exert the transactivation activity of DELLAs.

ER stress occurs under adverse environmental conditions and results from the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins in the ER lumen. One of the membrane-associated transcription factors activated by heat and ER stress agents is bZIP28. In its inactive form, bZIP28 is a type II membrane protein with a single pass transmembrane domain, residing in the ER. bZIP28’s N-terminus, containing a transcriptional activation domain, is oriented towards the cytoplasm and its C-terminal tail is inserted into the ER lumen. In response to stress, bZIP28 exits the ER and moves to the Golgi where it is proteolytically processed, liberating its cytosolic component which relocates to the nucleus to upregulate stress-response genes. bZIP28 is thought to sense stress through its interaction with the major ER chaperone, binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP). Under unstressed conditions, BIP binds to intrinsically disordered regions in bZIP28’s lumen-facing tail and retains it in the ER. A truncated form of bZIP28, without its C-terminal tail is not retained in the ER but migrates constitutively to the nucleus. Upon stress, BIP releases bZIP28 allowing it to exit the ER. One model to account for the release of bZIP28 by BIP is that BIP is competed away from bZIP28 by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. However, other forces such as changes in energy charge levels, redox conditions or interaction with DNAJ proteins may also promote release of bZIP28 from BIP. Movement of bZIP28 from the ER to the Golgi is assisted by the interaction of elements of the COPII machinery with the cytoplasmic domain of bZIP28. Thus, the mobilization of bZIP28 in response to stress involves the dissociation of factors that retain it in the ER and the association of factors that mediate its further organelle-to-organelle movement.",endoplasmic reticulum stress;unfolded protein response (UPR);bZIP transcription factors;binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP);protein folding;Golgi apparatus;COPII vesicle transport system

Acetylation at K14 favors the A15-P16trans conformation and reduces K4me3. Environmental stress-induced genes are most sensitive to the changes at K14 influencing H3 tail conformation and K4me3. By contrast, ribosomal protein genes maintain K4me3, required for their repression during stress, independently of Spp1, K14, and P16.

The only clearly defined function for CP12 in any organism is in the thioredoxin-mediated regulation of the Calvin–Benson cycle. CP12 mediates the formation of a complex between glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and phosphoribulokinase (PRK) in response to changes in light intensity. Under low light, the formation of the GAPDH/PRK/CP12 complex results in a reduction in the activity of both PRK and GAPDH and, under high light conditions, thioredoxin mediates the disassociation of the complex resulting in an increase in both GAPDH and PRK activity. Although the role of CP12 in the redox-mediated formation of the GAPDH/PRK/CP12 multiprotein complex has been clearly demonstrated, a number of studies now provide evidence that the CP12 proteins may play a wider role. In Arabidopsis thaliana CP12 is expressed in a range of tissue including roots, flowers, and seeds and antisense suppression of tobacco CP12 disrupts metabolism and impacts on growth and development. Furthermore, in addition to the higher plant genomes which encode up to three forms of CP12, analysis of cyanobacterial genomes has revealed that, not only are there multiple forms of the CP12 protein, but that in these organisms CP12 is also found fused to cystathionine-β-synthase domain containing proteins. In this review we present the latest information on the CP12 protein family and explore the possibility that CP12 proteins form part of a redox-mediated metabolic switch, allowing organisms to respond to rapid changes in the external environment.",protein–protein interactions;redox;cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS)-domains;thioredoxin;intrinsically unstructured (disordered) protein

The MALDI-ISD spectra of bovine serum albumin (BSA), myoglobin and thioredoxin show discontinuous intense ion peaks originating from one-side preferential cleavage at the N-Cα bond of Xxx-Asp, Xxx-Asn, Xxx-Cys and Gly-Xxx residues. Consistent with these observations, Asp, Asn and Gly residues are also identified by other flexibility measures such as B-factor, turn preference, protection and fluorescence decay factors, while Asp, Asn, Cys and Gly residues are identified by turn preference factor based on X-ray crystallography. The results suggest that protein molecules embedded in/on MALDI matrix crystals partly maintain α-helix and that the reason some of the residues are more susceptible to ISD (Asp, Asn, Cys and Gly) and others less so (Ile and Val) is because of accessibility of the peptide backbone to hydrogen-radicals from matrix molecules. The hydrogen-radical accessibility in MALDI-ISD could therefore be adopted as a factor for measuring protein flexibility.",proteins;hydrogen-radical;flexibility;MALDI MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry);in-source decay

The biological effects of selenium are largely mediated by selenium-containing proteins (selenoproteins) that are present in all three domains of life. Although selenoproteins represent diverse molecular pathways and biological functions, all these proteins contain at least one selenocysteine (Sec), a selenium-containing amino acid, and most serve oxidoreductase functions. Sec is cotranslationally inserted into nascent polypeptide chains in response to the UGA codon, whose normal function is to terminate translation. To decode UGA as Sec, organisms evolved the Sec insertion machinery that allows incorporation of this amino acid at specific UGA codons in a process requiring a cis-acting Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element. Although the basic mechanisms of Sec synthesis and insertion into proteins in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes have been studied in great detail, the identity and functions of many selenoproteins remain largely unknown. In the last decade, there has been significant progress in characterizing selenoproteins and selenoproteomes and understanding their physiological functions. We discuss current knowledge about how these unique proteins perform their functions at the molecular level and highlight new insights into the roles that selenoproteins play in human health.",

The picture of metal coordination to PrP has been improved and refined over the past decade, and yet the structural details of the various metal coordination modes have not been fully elucidated in some cases. Herein we employ X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy as well as extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy to structurally characterize the dominant 1:1 coordination modes for CuII, CuI and ZnII with an N-terminal fragment of PrP. The PrP fragment constitutes four tandem repeats representative of the mammalian octarepeat domain, designated OR4, which is also the most studied PrP fragment for metal interactions, making our findings applicable to a large body of previous work. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide additional structural and thermodynamic data, and candidate structures are used to inform EXAFS data analysis. The optimized geometries from DFT calculations are used to identify potential coordination complexes for multi-histidine coordination of CuII, CuI and ZnII in an aqueous medium, modeled using 4-methylimidazole to represent the histidine side chain. Through a combination of in silico coordination chemistry as well as rigorous EXAFS curve fitting, using full multiple scattering on candidate structures from DFT calculations, we have characterized the predominant coordination modes for the 1:1 complexes of CuII, CuI and ZnII with the OR4 peptide at pH 7.4 at atomic resolution, which are best represented as a square planar [CuII(His)4]2+, digonal [CuI(His)2]+ and tetrahedral [ZnII(His)3(OH2)]2+, respectively.",prion;copper;zinc;X-ray absorption spectroscopy;density functional calculations

However, the function of ING4 in human osteosarcoma remains unclear. To understand its potential roles and mechanisms in inhibiting osteosarcoma, we constructed an expression vector pEGFP-ING4 and transfected the human osteosarcoma cells using this vector. We then studied the effects of over-expressed ING4 in the transfected cells on the proliferation, apoptosis and invasion of the osteosarcoma cells. The up-regulation of ING4 in the osteosarcoma cells, arising from the stable pEGFP-ING4 gene transfection, was found to significantly inhibit the cell proliferation by the cell cycle alteration with S phase reduction and G0/G1 phase arrest, induce cell apoptosis via the activation of the mitochondria pathway, and suppress cell invasion through the down-regulation of the matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 expression. In addition, increased ING4 level evoked the blockade of NF-κB signaling pathway and down-regulation of its target proteins.

Here, we tested whether differences in recognition of TM or actin isoforms by Tmod1 and Tmod3 contribute to the distinct cellular functions of these Tmods. We found that Tmod3 bound ∼5-fold more weakly than Tmod1 to α/βTM, TM5b, and TM5NM1. However, surprisingly, Tmod3 was as effective as Tmod1 at capping pointed ends of skeletal muscle α-actin (αsk-actin) filaments coated with α/βTM, TM5b, or TM5NM1. Tmod3 only capped TM-coated αsk-actin filaments more weakly than Tmod1 in the presence of recombinant αTM2, which is unacetylated at its NH2 terminus, binds F-actin weakly, and has a disabled Tmod-binding site. Moreover, both Tmod1 and Tmod3 were similarly effective at capping pointed ends of platelet β/cytoplasmic γ (γcyto)-actin filaments coated with TM5NM1. In the absence of TMs, both Tmod1 and Tmod3 had similarly weak abilities to nucleate β/γcyto-actin filament assembly, but only Tmod3 could sequester cytoplasmic β- and γcyto-actin (but not αsk-actin) monomers and prevent polymerization under physiological conditions. Thus, differences in TM binding by Tmod1 and Tmod3 do not appear to regulate the abilities of these Tmods to cap TM-αsk-actin or TM-β/γcyto-actin pointed ends and, thus, are unlikely to determine selective co-assembly of Tmod, TM, and actin isoforms in different cell types and cytoskeletal structures.

The three-dimensional structure of a protein-protein complex, generally, is more difficult to determine experimentally than the structure of an individual protein. Adequate computational techniques to model protein interactions are important because of the growing number of known protein structures, particularly in the context of structural genomics. Docking offers tools for fundamental studies of protein interactions and provides a structural basis for drug design. Protein-protein docking is the prediction of the structure of the complex, given the structures of the individual proteins. In the heart of the docking methodology is the notion of steric and physicochemical complementarity at the protein-protein interface. Originally, mostly high-resolution, experimentally determined (primarily by x-ray crystallography) protein structures were considered for docking. However, more recently, the focus has been shifting toward lower-resolution modeled structures. Docking approaches have to deal with the conformational changes between unbound and bound structures, as well as the inaccuracies of the interacting modeled structures, often in a high-throughput mode needed for modeling of large networks of protein interactions. The growing number of docking developers is engaged in the community-wide assessments of predictive methodologies. The development of more powerful and adequate docking approaches is facilitated by rapidly expanding information and data resources, growing computational capabilities, and a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles of protein interactions.",

Critical amino acid residues will determine the range or stability of structural changes within the ovine prion protein or its functional interaction with potential cofactors, during conversion of PrPC to PrPSc in these different forms of scrapie disease. Here we computationally identified that regions of ovine PrP, including those near amino acid residues 141 and 154, displayed more conservation than expected based on local structural environment. Molecular dynamics simulations showed these conserved regions of ovine PrP displayed genotypic differences in conformational repertoire and amino acid side-chain interactions.

Kinetic models of amyloidogenesis require data on the number concentration and size distribution of aggregates, but this information is difficult to obtain using conventional methods. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) is a relatively new technique that may be uniquely suited for obtaining these data. In NTA, the two-dimensional (2-D) trajectory of individual particles is tracked, from which the diffusion coefficient, and, hence, hydrodynamic radius is obtained. Here we examine the validity of NTA in tracking number concentration and size of DNA, as a model of a fibrillar macromolecule.

For protein–protein, protein–nucleic acid and a subset of protein–chemical interactions, we also developed and benchmarked a measure of whether modifications are likely to enhance or diminish the interactions, which can assist the detection of modifications with specific effects. Analysis of high-throughput sequencing data shows that the approach can identify interesting differences between cancers, and application to proteomics data finds potential mechanistic insights for how post-translational modifications can alter biomolecular interactions.",

The work presented highlighted significant advances in understanding nucleocytoplasmic trafficking including how transport receptors and cargoes pass through the nuclear pore complex, the many signaling pathways that impinge on transport pathways, interplay between the nuclear envelope, nuclear pore complexes, and transport pathways, and numerous links between transport pathways and human disease.

The proposed member of the LcrE protein family from some Chlamydia species (e.g. pCopN from C. pneumoniae) binds tubulin and inhibits microtubule assembly in vitro. From the pCopN structure and its similarity with that of MxiC from Shigella, we definitively confirm CopN as the Chlamydia homolog of the LcrE family of bacterial proteins involved in the regulation of type III secretion. We have also investigated the molecular basis for the pCopN effect on microtubules. We show that pCopN delays microtubule nucleation and acts as a pure tubulin-sequestering protein at steady state. It targets the β subunit interface involved in the tubulin longitudinal self-association in a way that inhibits nucleotide exchange. pCopN contains three repetitions of a helical motif flanked by disordered N- and C-terminal extensions. We have identified the pCopN minimal tubulin-binding region within the second and third repeats. Together with the intriguing observation that C. trachomatis CopN does not bind tubulin, our data support the notion that, in addition to the shared function of type III secretion regulation, these proteins have evolved different functions in the host cytosol. Our results provide a mechanistic framework for understanding the C. pneumoniae CopN-specific inhibition of microtubule assembly.",Chlamydia;Microtubule;Protein-Protein Interaction;Structural Biology;Tubulin

Here we review existing methods and techniques to study and predict the effects of DNA mutations from three different perspectives: in silico, in vitro and in vivo.

E-mail ed.lbme@eztneh","RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) control RNA fate from synthesis to decay. Since their cellular expression levels frequently do not reflect their in vivo activity, methods are needed to assess the steady state RNA-binding activity of RBPs as well as their responses to stimuli. While electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSA) have been used for such determinations, their results serve at best as proxies for the RBP activities in living cells. Here, we describe a quantitative dual fluorescence method to analyze protein–mRNA interactions in vivo. Known or candidate RBPs are fused to fluorescent proteins (eGFP, YFP), expressed in cells, cross-linked in vivo to RNA by ultraviolet light irradiation, and immunoprecipitated, after lysis, with a single chain antibody fragment directed against eGFP (GFP-binding protein, GBP). Polyadenylated RNA-binding activity of fusion proteins is assessed by hybridization with an oligo(DT) probe coupled with a red fluorophore. Since UV light is directly applied to living cells, the assay can be used to monitor dynamic changes in RNA-binding activities in response to biological or pharmacological stimuli. Notably, immunoprecipitation and hybridization can also be performed with commercially available GBP-coupled 96-well plates (GFP-multiTrap), allowing highly parallel RNA-binding measurements in a single experiment. Therefore, this method creates the possibility to conduct in vivo high-throughput RNA-binding assays. We believe that this fast and simple radioactivity-free method will find many useful applications in RNA biology.",fluorescence;protein–RNA interaction;RNA;RNA-binding proteins

Spin probe experiments have also shown that better molecular immobilization in dry hydroxyectoine provides better redox stability of the molecules embedded in this dry matrix. With a glass transition temperature of 87°C (vs. 47°C for ectoine) hydroxyectoine displays remarkable desiccation protection properties, on a par with sucrose and trehalose.

correct assembly and disassembly of other macromolecular structures, which they
themselves do not remain a part of. They associate with a large and diverse set
of coregulators termed cochaperones that regulate their function and
specificity. Amongst others, chaperones and cochaperones regulate the activity
of several signaling molecules including steroid receptors, which upon ligand
binding interact with discrete nucleotide sequences within the nucleus to
control the expression of diverse physiological and developmental genes.
Molecular chaperones and cochaperones are typically known to provide the correct
conformation for ligand binding by the steroid receptors. While this
contribution is widely accepted, recent studies have reported that they further
modulate steroid receptor action outside ligand binding. They are thought to
contribute to receptor turnover, transport of the receptor to different
subcellular localizations, recycling of the receptor on chromatin and even
stabilization of the DNA-binding properties of the receptor. In addition to
these combined effects with molecular chaperones, cochaperones are reported to
have additional functions that are independent of molecular chaperones. Some of
these functions also impact on steroid receptor action. Two well-studied
examples are the cochaperones p23 and Bag-1L, which have been identified as
modulators of steroid receptor activity in nuclei. Understanding details of
their regulatory action will provide new therapeutic opportunities of
controlling steroid receptor action independent of the widespread effects of
molecular chaperones.",steroid receptors;nuclear receptors;chaperones;cellular transport

The megasynthase is a 2 MDa trimeric complex comprised of three unique homodimers assembled from the gene products DEBS1, DEBS2, and DEBS3, which are housed within the erythromycin biosynthetic gene cluster. Each homodimer contains two clusters of catalytically independent enzymatic domains, each referred to as a module, which catalyzes one round of polyketide chain extension and modification. Modules are named sequentially to indicate the order in which they are utilized during synthesis of 6-dEB. We report small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analyses of a whole module and bimodule from DEBS as well as a set of domains for which high-resolution structures are available. In all cases, the solution state was probed under previously established conditions that ensure each protein is catalytically active. SAXS data are consistent with atomic-resolution structures of DEBS fragments. Therefore, we used the available high-resolution structures of DEBS domains to model the architectures of the larger protein assemblies using rigid body refinement. Our data supports a model in which, the third module of DEBS forms a disc-shaped structure capable of caging the acyl carrier protein domain proximal to each active site. The molecular envelope of DEBS3 is a thin, elongated ellipsoid, and the results of rigid body modeling suggest that modules 5 and 6 stack colinearly along the 2-fold axis of symmetry.",

This diversity was determined in living cells of intact multicellular tissues using 20 different marker proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana, mostly belonging to the Remorin protein family. These proteins associate with microdomains at the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane. We characterized these membrane domains and determined their lateral dynamics by extensive quantitative image analysis. Systematic colocalization experiments with an extended subset of marker proteins tested in 45 different combinations revealed the coexistence of highly distinct membrane domains on individual cell surfaces.

One emerging link between glucose hypometabolism and progression of AD is the nutrient-responsive post-translational O-GlcNAcylation of nucleocytoplasmic proteins. O-GlcNAc is abundant in neurons and occurs on both tau and amyloid precursor protein. Increased brain O-GlcNAcylation protects against tau and amyloid-β peptide toxicity. Decreased O-GlcNAcylation occurs in AD, suggesting that glucose hypometabolism may impair the protective roles of O-GlcNAc within neurons and enable neurodegeneration. Here, we review how O-GlcNAc may link cerebral glucose hypometabolism to progression of AD and summarize data regarding the protective role of O-GlcNAc in AD models.",Alzheimer Disease;Amyloid-β (Aβ);Brain Metabolism;Glucose Metabolism;Glycobiology;Glycoprotein;Glycosylation;O-GlcNAcylation;O-Linked N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc);Tau Protein (Tau)

Its surface is ‘decorated’ with proteins that are covalently anchored to the cell wall peptidoglycan. Structural and functional analysis has identified four distinct classes of surface proteins, of which microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs) are the largest class. These surface proteins have numerous functions, including adhesion to and invasion of host cells and tissues, evasion of immune responses and biofilm formation. Thus, cell wall-anchored proteins are essential virulence factors for the survival of S. aureus in the commensal state and during invasive infections, and targeting them with vaccines could combat S. aureus infections.",

The RydC/Hfq structure reveals that the U-rich tail is bound in a recessed channel on the proximal face of Hfq. The electron density is not well defined in this region, and there may be disorder or multiple conformations of the polyU tail, but the features do show that uridines U61, U62, and U64 (as well as C63) each forms an aromatic base stacking interaction with the ring of F42 (Figure 3C; distances provided in Figure 3—figure supplement 1). K56 forms hydrogen bonds with the O2 group of the uracils, consistent with the importance of this residue in binding RNA on the proximal face (Mikulecky et al., 2004). The model indicates that there are likely to be hydrogen bonds between the uridine bases and Q41 and Q8, as well as between the furanose 2′ OH group with the imidazole group of H57. These interactions are consistent with the crystal structure of Salmonella Typhimurium Hfq/polyU (Sauer and Weichenrieder, 2011; PDB code 2YLC) and with fluorescence quenching experiments for binding U6 (Robinson et al., 2013). Similar interactions are seen in the crystal structure of Staphylococcus aureus Hfq in complex with AUUUUUG (Schumacher et al., 2002; PDB code 1KQ2) and E. coli Hfq in complex with AUUUUUA (Wang et al., 2011, 2013; PDB code 4HT9). In principle, the RNA can visit each of the uridine pockets following a clockwise or counter-clockwise path, but the polarity seems to be consistently clockwise in the reference frame that views the proximal face.

Estrogen can induce PDZK1 gene expression; however, our recent report showed that PDZK1 expression in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 is indirect and involves insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 receptor function. Such a relationship was established in cell culture systems and human breast cancer tissues. Here we show that overexpression of PDZK1 promoted an increase in cyclin D1 and enhanced anchorage-independent growth of MCF-7 cells in the absence of 17β-estradiol, suggesting that PDZK1 harbors oncogenic activity. Indeed, PDKZ1 overexpression enhanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-stimulated MEK/ERK1/2 signaling and IGF-induced Akt phosphorylation. PDZK1 appeared to play this role, in part, by stabilizing the integrity of the growth promoting factors Akt, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2/Neu) and EGFR. Increased Akt levels occurred via a decrease in the ubiquitination of the kinase. PDZK1 overexpression was associated with resistance to paclitaxel/5-fluorouracil/etoposide only at low concentrations. Although the increased stability of Akt was sensitive to heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibition, increased levels of the cochaperone cell division cycle 37 (Cdc37), as well as its ability to bind PDZK1, appear to play a larger role in kinase stability. Using human tissue microarrays, we show strong positive correlation between PDZK1, Akt and Cdc37 protein levels, and all correlated with human breast malignancy. There were no positive correlations between PDZK1 and Cdc37 at the mRNA levels, confirming our in vitro studies. These results demonstrate a relationship between PDZK1, Akt and Cdc37, and potentially Her2/Neu and EGFR, in breast cancer, representing a new axis that can be targeted therapeutically to reduce the burden of human breast cancer.",

Curvature-inducing proteins can act as curvature sensors; they aggregate to membrane regions matching their intrinsic curvature; as well as induce curvature in cell membranes to stabilize emergent high curvature, nonspherical, structures such as tubules, discs, and caveolae. A definitive understanding of the interplay between protein recruitment and migration, the evolution of membrane curvature, and membrane morphological transitions is emerging but remains incomplete. Here, within a continuum framework and using the machinery of Monte Carlo simulations, we introduce and compare three free-energy methods to delineate the free-energy landscape of curvature-inducing proteins on bilayer membranes. We demonstrate the utility of the Widom test particle (or field) insertion methodology in computing the excess chemical potentials associated with curvature-inducing proteins on the membrane—in particular, we use this method to track the onset of morphological transitions in the membrane at elevated protein densities. We validate this approach by comparing the results from the Widom method with those of thermodynamic integration and Bennett acceptance ratio methods. Furthermore, the predictions from the Widom method have been tested against analytical calculations of the excess chemical potential at infinite dilution. Our results are useful in precisely quantifying the free-energy landscape, and also in determining the phase boundaries associated with curvature-induction, curvature-sensing, and morphological transitions. This approach can be extended to studies exploring the role of thermal fluctuations and other external (control) variables, such as membrane excess area, in shaping curvature-mediated interactions on bilayer membranes.",

Ub-fold proteins of archaea (SAMPs, small archaeal modifier proteins) and Thermus (TtuB, tRNA-two-thiouridine B) that differ from Ub in amino acid sequence, yet share a common β-grasp fold, also form isopeptide bonds by a mechanism that appears streamlined compared with ubiquitylation. SAMPs and TtuB are found to be members of a small group of Ub-fold proteins that function not only in protein modification but also in sulfur-transfer pathways associated with tRNA thiolation and molybdopterin biosynthesis.

While significant progress has been made, the success rate of protein design remains low. As a result, a library of designed sequences or profile of sequences is currently employed for guiding experimental screening or directed evolution. Sequence profiles can be computationally predicted by iterative mutations of a random sequence to produce energy-optimized sequences, or by combining sequences of structurally similar fragments in a template library. The latter approach is computationally more efficient but yields less accurate profiles than the former because of lacking tertiary structural information. Here we present a method called SPIN that predicts Sequence Profiles by Integrated Neural network based on fragment-derived sequence profiles and structure-derived energy profiles. SPIN improves over the fragment-derived profile by 6.7% (from 23.6% to 30.3%) in sequence identity between predicted and wild-type sequences. The method also reduces the number of residues in low complex regions by 15.7% and has a significant better balance of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues at protein surfaces. The accuracy of sequence profiles obtained is comparable to those generated from the protein design program RosettaDesign 3.5. This highly efficient method for predicting sequence profiles from structures will be useful as a single-body scoring term for improving scoring functions used in protein design and fold recognition. It also complements protein design programs in guiding experimental design of the sequence library for screening and directed evolution of designed sequences.

In the present work, a relative large nanopore with a diameter of about 60 nm has been used to detect protein translocation driven by a series of applied voltages. Compared with previous studied small nanopores, a distinct profile of protein translocation through a larger nanopore has been characterized. First, a higher threshold voltage is required to drive proteins into the large nanopore. With the increase of voltages, the capture frequency of protein into the nanopore has been markedly enhanced. And the distribution of current blockage events is characterized as a function of biased voltages. Due to the large dimension of the nanopore, the adsorption and desorption phenomenon of proteins observed with a prolonged dwell time has been weakened in our work. Nevertheless, the protein can still be stretched into an unfolded state by increased electric forces at high voltages. In consideration of the high throughput of the large nanopore, a couple of proteins passing through the nanopore simultaneously occur at high voltage. As a new feature, the feasibility and specificity of a nanopore with distinct geometry have been demonstrated for sensing protein translocation, which broadly expand the application of nanopore devices.",Protein translocation;Solid state nanopore;Current blockage;Translocation time

Although pannexin 1 does not form intercellular channels, a common channel topology and oligomerization state, as well as involvement of the intracellular carboxyl terminal (CT) domain in channel gating, is shared with connexins. In this study, we characterized the secondary structure of the mouse pannexin 1 cytoplasmic domains to complement structural studies of the transmembrane segments and compare with similar domains from connexins. A combination of structural prediction tools and circular dichroism revealed that, unlike connexins (predominately intrinsically disordered), cytosolic regions of pannexin 1 contain approximately 50% secondary structure, a majority being α-helical. Moreover, prediction of transmembrane domains uncovered a potential membrane interacting region (I360-G370) located upstream of the caspase cleavage site (D375-D378) within the pannexin 1 CT domain. The α-helical content of a peptide containing these domains (G357-S384) increased in the presence of detergent micelles providing evidence of membrane association. We also purified a pannexin 1 CT construct containing the caspase cleavage site (M374-C426), assigned the resonances by NMR, and confirmed cleavage by Caspase-3 in vitro.

These include neutralization of the lysine’s positive charge to directly
influence histone tail-DNA/internucleosomal interactions or indirect effects via
bromodomain-containing effector proteins. Recently, we described a novel
function of lysine acetylation to influence proline isomerization and thus local
protein conformation. We found that acetylation of lysine 14 in the histone H3
N-terminal tail (H3K14ac), an intrinsically disordered domain, increased the
proportion of neighbouring proline 16 (H3P16) in the trans
conformation. This conformation of the tail was associated with reduced
tri-methylation on histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) due to both decreased
methylation by the Set1 methyltransferase (with the me3-specific subunit Spp1)
and increased demethylation by the demethylase Jhd2. Interestingly, H3K4me3 on
individual genes was differentially affected by substitution of H3K14 or H3P16,
with ribosomal protein genes losing the least H3K4me3 and environmental

Analysis of mammalian genomic and transcriptomic data shows that contrary to the traditional view, the joint contribution of ATI and ATT to the transcriptome and proteome diversity is quantitatively greater than the contribution of AS. Although the mean numbers of protein-coding constitutive and alternative nucleotides in gene loci are nearly identical, their distribution along the transcripts is highly non-uniform. On average, coding exons in the variable 5′ and 3′ transcript ends that are created by ATI and ATT contain approximately four times more alternative nucleotides than core protein-coding regions that diversify exclusively via AS. Short upstream exons that encompass alternative 5′-untranslated regions and N-termini of proteins evolve under strong nucleotide-level selection whereas in 3′-terminal exons that encode protein C-termini, protein-level selection is significantly stronger.

To study the functional interplay between TM binding and TM-actin filament capping by Tmods, we introduced disabling mutations into the first, second, or both TM-binding sites of full-length Tmod1 (Tmod1-L27G, Tmod1-I131D, and Tmod1-L27G/I131D, respectively) and full-length Tmod3 (Tmod3-L29G, Tmod3-L134D, and Tmod3-L29G/L134D, respectively). Tmod1 and Tmod3 showed somewhat different TM-binding site utilization, but nearly all TM binding was abolished in Tmod1-L27G/I131D and Tmod3-L29G/L134D. Disruption of Tmod-TM binding had a modest effect on Tmod1's ability and no effect on Tmod3's ability to stabilize TM-actin pointed ends against latrunculin A-induced depolymerization. However, disruption of Tmod-TM binding did significantly impair the ability of Tmod3 to reduce elongation rates at pointed ends with α/βTM, albeit less so with TM5NM1, and not at all with TM5b. For Tmod1, disruption of Tmod-TM binding only slightly impaired its ability to reduce elongation rates with α/βTM and TM5NM1, but not at all with TM5b. Thus, Tmod-TM binding has a greater influence on Tmods’ ability to inhibit subunit association as compared to dissociation from TM-actin pointed ends, particularly for α/βTM, with Tmod3's activity being more dependent on TM binding than Tmod1's activity. Nevertheless, disruption of Tmod1-TM binding precluded Tmod1 targeting to thin filament pointed ends in cardiac myocytes, suggesting that the functional effects of Tmod-TM binding on TM-coated actin filament capping can be significantly modulated by the in vivo conformation of the pointed end or other factors in the intracellular environment.",

As the inhibition for those tumor-associated mutant IDH proteins may induce differentiation of those cancer cells, these tumor-associated mutant IDH proteins can be treated as a drug target proteins for a differentiation therapy against cancers. In this study, we aim to identify the potent TCM compounds from the TCM Database@Taiwan as lead compounds of IDH2 R140Q mutant inhibitor. Comparing to the IDH2 R140Q mutant protein inhibitor, AGI-6780, the top two TCM compounds, precatorine and abrine, have higher binding affinities with target protein in docking simulation. After MD simulation, the top two TCM compounds remain as the same docking poses under dynamic conditions. In addition, precatorine is extracted from Abrus precatorius L., which represents the cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects for breast cancer and several tumor lines. Hence, we propose the TCM compounds, precatorine and abrine, as potential candidates as lead compounds for further study in drug development process with the IDH2 R140Q mutant protein against cancer.",

In Escherichia coli, RNase E contributes to the majority of RNA turnover and processing events, and the enzyme has been extensively characterized as the central component of the RNA degradosome assembly. A similar RNA degradosome assembly has been described in the α-proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus, with the interacting partners of RNase E identified as the Kreb's cycle enzyme aconitase, a DEAD-box RNA helicase RhlB and the exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase. Here we report that an additional degradosome component is the essential exoribonuclease RNase D, and its recognition site within RNase E is identified. We show that, unlike its E. coli counterpart, C. crescentus RhlB interacts directly with a segment of the N-terminal catalytic domain of RNase E. The crystal structure of a portion of C. crescentus RNase E encompassing the helicase-binding region is reported. This structure reveals that an inserted segment in the S1 domain adopts an α-helical conformation, despite being predicted to be natively unstructured.

We have structurally characterized the colicin M-like bacteriocin, pectocin M2, which is active against strains of Pectobacterium spp. This unusual bacteriocin lacks the intrinsically unstructured translocation domain that usually mediates translocation of these bacteriocins across the outer membrane, containing only a single globular ferredoxin domain connected to its cytotoxic domain by a flexible α-helix, which allows it to adopt two distinct conformations in solution. The ferredoxin domain of pectocin M2 is homologous to plant ferredoxins and allows pectocin M2 to parasitize a system utilized by Pectobacterium to obtain iron during infection of plants. Furthermore, we identify a novel ferredoxin-containing bacteriocin pectocin P, which possesses a cytotoxic domain homologous to lysozyme, illustrating that the ferredoxin domain acts as a generic delivery module for cytotoxic domains in Pectobacterium.",

To improve the outcome of unresectable and recurrent gallbladder cancer, it is necessary to develop new effective treatments and drugs. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of cordycepin on human gallbladder cells and uncover the molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects. The Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays revealed that cordycepin affected the viability and proliferation of human gallbladder cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analysis showed that cordycepin induced S phase arrest in human gallbladder cancer cell lines(NOZ and GBC-SD cells). Cordycepin-induced apoptosis was observed using an Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) double-staining assay, and the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, western blot analysis revealed the upregulation of cleaved-caspase-3, cleaved-caspase-9, cleaved-PARP and Bax and the downregulation of Bcl-2, cyclin A and Cdk-2 in cordycepin-treated cells. Moreover, cordycepin inhibited tumor growth in nude mice bearing NOZ tumors.

Monkey-bar dynamics highly depends on the properties of the multidomain protein (the affinity of each of the constituent domains to the DNA and the length of the linker) and the DNA molecules (their inter-distance and inter-angle). In this study, we investigate using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations how the local conformation of the DNA may affect the DNA search performed by a multidomain protein Pax6 in comparison to that of the isolated domains. Our results suggest that in addition to the common rotation-coupled translation along the DNA major groove, for curved DNA the tethered domains may slide in a rotation-decoupled sliding mode. Furthermore, the multidomain proteins move by longer jumps on curved DNA compared with those performed by the single domain protein. The long jumps originate from the DNA curvature bringing two sequentially distant DNA sites into close proximity with each other and they suggest that multidomain proteins may move on highly curved DNA faster than linear DNA.",

They are particularly abundant in mammals, where by conservative estimates one in three proteins contain a TR. High generation-scale duplication and deletion rates were reported for nucleic TR units. However, it is not known whether protein TR units can also be frequently lost or gained providing a source of variation for rapid adaptation of protein function, or alternatively, tend to have conserved TR unit configurations over long evolutionary times. To obtain a systematic picture, we performed a proteome-wide analysis of the mode of evolution for human protein TRs. For this purpose, we propose a novel method for the detection of orthologous TRs based on circular profile hidden Markov models. For all detected TRs, we reconstructed bispecies TR unit phylogenies across 61 eukaryotes ranging from human to yeast. Moreover, we performed additional analyses to correlate functional and structural annotations of human TRs with their mode of evolution. Surprisingly, we find that the vast majority of human TRs are ancient, with TR unit number and order preserved intact since distant speciation events. For example, ≥61% of all human TRs have been strongly conserved at least since the root of all mammals, approximately 300 Ma. Further, we find no human protein TR that shows evidence for strong recent duplications and deletions. The results are in contrast to the high generation-scale mutability of nucleic TRs. Presumably, most protein TRs fold into stable and conserved structures that are indispensable for the function of the TR-containing protein.

We recently demonstrated a novel phenomenon in cell cycle regulation by showing that cyclin-dependent kinase–dependent multisite phosphorylation of a crucial substrate is performed sequentially in the N-to-C terminal direction along the disordered protein. The process is controlled by key parameters, including the distance between phosphorylation sites, the distribution of serines and threonines in sites, and the position of docking motifs. According to our model, linear patterns of phosphorylation along disordered protein segments determine the signal-response function of a multisite phosphorylation switch. Here we discuss the general advantages and engineering principles of multisite phosphorylation networks as processors of kinase signals. We also address the idea of using the mechanistic logic of linear multisite phosphorylation networks to design circuits for synthetic biology applications.",

The method utilizes a hydrophilic PTFE membrane engineered for presentation of aqueous samples in a dried format compatible with fast infrared analysis. Unlike classical quantification techniques, the reported method is amino acid sequence independent and thus applicable to complex samples of unknown composition. By comparison to existing platforms, this MIR-based method enables direct quantification using minimal sample volume (2 µL); it is well-suited where repeat access and limited sample size are critical parameters. Further, accurate results can be derived without specialized training or knowledge of IR spectroscopy. Overall, the simplified application and analysis system provides a more cost-effective alternative to high-throughput IR systems for research laboratories with minimal throughput demands. In summary, the MIR-based system provides a viable alternative to current protein quantitation methods; it also uniquely offers simultaneous qualification of other components, notably lipids and detergents.",

In most cases the (Ca2+)4-form of CaM leads to the activation of a key regulatory enzyme or protein in a myriad of biological processes. Using the nitroxide spin-labeling reagent, 3-(2-iodoacetamido)-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-pyrrolidinyl oxyl, bovine brain CaM was modified at 2-3 methionines with retention of activity as judged by the activation of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase. X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was used to measure the spectral changes upon addition of Ca2+ to the apo-form of spin-labeled protein. A significant loss of spectral intensity, arising primarily from reductions in the heights of the low, intermediate, and high field peaks, accompanied Ca2+ binding. The midpoint of the Ca2+-mediated transition determined by EPR occurred at a higher Ca2+ concentration than that measured with circular dichroic spectroscopy and enzyme activation. Recent data have indicated that the transition from the apo-state of CaM to the fully saturated form, [Ca2+)4-CaM], contains a compact intermediate corresponding to [Ca2+)2-CaM], and the present results suggest that the spin probes are reporting on Ca2+ binding to the last two sites in the N-terminal domain, i.e. for the [Ca2+)2-CaM] → [Ca2+)4-CaM] transition in which the compact structure becomes more extended. EPR of CaM, spin-labeled at methionines, offers a different approach for studying Ca2+-mediated conformational changes and may emerge as a useful technique for monitoring interactions with target proteins.",Calmodulin;Calcium binding;Spin labeling;Nitroxide;Electron paramagnetic resonance;Circular dichroism;Phosphodiesterase

After export of prolipoproteins through the cytoplasmic membrane, which occurs predominantly but not exclusively via the general secretory or Sec pathway, the proteins are lipid-modified at the cytoplasmic membrane in a multistep process that involves sequential modification of a cysteine residue and cleavage of the signal peptide by the signal II peptidase Lsp. In both monoderms and diderms, signal peptide processing is preceded by acylation with a diacylglycerol through preprolipoprotein diacylglycerol transferase (Lgt). In diderms but also some monoderms, lipoproteins are further modified with a third acyl chain through lipoprotein N-acyl transferase (Lnt). Fully modified lipoproteins that are destined to be anchored in the inner leaflet of the outer membrane (OM) are selected, transported and inserted by the Lol (lipoprotein outer membrane localization) pathway machinery, which consists of the inner-membrane (IM) ABC transporterlike LolCDE complex, the periplasmic LolA chaperone and the OM LolB lipoprotein receptor. Retention of lipoproteins in the cytoplasmic membrane results from Lol avoidance signals that were originally described as the “+2 rule”. Surface localization of lipoproteins in diderms is rare in most bacteria, with the exception of several spirochetal species. Type 2 (T2SS) and type 5 (T5SS) secretion systems are involved in secretion of specific surface lipoproteins of γ-proteobacteria. In the model spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, surface lipoprotein secretion does not follow established sorting rules, but remains dependent on N-terminal peptide sequences. Secretion through the outer membrane requires maintenance of lipoproteins in a translocation-competent unfolded conformation, likely through interaction with a periplasmic holding chaperone, which delivers the proteins to an outer membrane lipoprotein flippase.",

Pulsed field gradient-NMR spectroscopy was used to determine the effective hydrodynamic radius of NS3h, which was constant over a wide range of protein concentrations in the absence and presence of ssRNA. Size exclusion chromatography-static light scattering experiments showed that NS3h eluted as a monomeric molecule even in the presence of ssRNA. Binding of NS3h to ssRNA was studied by quantitative fluorescence titrations using fluorescein-labeled and unlabeled ssRNA oligonucleotides of different lengths, and the effect of the fluorescein label on the interaction parameters was also analyzed. Experimental results were well described by a statistical thermodynamic model based on the theory of non-specific interactions of large ligands to a one-dimensional lattice.

RNA–protein remodeling events required for spliceosome assembly, splicing catalysis, and spliceosome disassembly are driven and controlled by a conserved group of ATPases/RNA helicases. The activities of most of these enzymes are timed by their recruitment to the spliceosome. The Brr2 enzyme, however, which mediates spliceosome catalytic activation, is a stable subunit of the spliceosome, and thus, requires special regulation. Recent structural and functional studies have revealed diverse mechanisms whereby an RNaseH-like and a Jab1/MPN-like domain of the Prp8 protein regulate Brr2 activity during splicing both positively and negatively. Reversible Brr2 inhibition might in part be achieved via an intrinsically unstructured element of the Prp8 Jab1/MPN domain, a concept widespread in biological systems. Mutations leading to changes in the Prp8 Jab1/MPN domain, which are linked to a severe form of retinitis pigmentosa, disrupt Jab1/MPN-mediated regulation of Brr2.",Pre-mRNA splicing;RNA helicase;RNA-protein complex;retinitis pigmentosa;spliceosome catalytic activation

Recognition of GA by GID1 relieves the repression mediated by the DELLA protein, a model known as the GID1-DELLA GA perception system. There have been reports of potential GA-binding proteins in the plasma membrane that perceive GA and induce α-amylase expression in cereal aleurone cells, which is mechanistically different from the GID1-DELLA system. Therefore, we examined the expression of the rice (Oryza sativa) α-amylase genes in rice mutants impaired in the GA receptor (gid1) and the DELLA repressor (slender rice1; slr1) and confirmed their lack of response to GA in gid1 mutants and constitutive expression in slr1 mutants. We also examined the expression of GA-regulated genes by genome-wide microarray and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses and confirmed that all GA-regulated genes are modulated by the GID1-DELLA system. Furthermore, we studied the regulatory network involved in GA signaling by using a set of mutants defective in genes involved in GA perception and gene expression, namely gid1, slr1, gid2 (a GA-related F-box protein mutant), and gamyb (a GA-related trans-acting factor mutant). Almost all GA up-regulated genes were regulated by the four named GA-signaling components. On the other hand, GA down-regulated genes showed different expression patterns with respect to GID2 and GAMYB (e.g. a considerable number of genes are not controlled by GAMYB or GID2 and GAMYB). Based on these observations, we present a comprehensive discussion of the intricate network of GA-regulated genes in rice aleurone cells.",

PI31 has a C-terminal HbYX (where Hb is a hydrophobic amino acid, Y is tyrosine, and X is any amino acid) motif characteristic of several proteasome activators. Peptides corresponding to the PI31 C terminus also bind to and activate the 20 S proteasome in an HbYX-dependent manner, but intact PI31protein inhibits in vitro 20 S activity. Binding to and inhibition of the proteasome by PI31 are conferred by the HbYX-containing proline-rich C-terminal domain but do not require HbYX residues. Thus, multiple regions of PI31 bind independently to the proteasome and collectively determine effects on activity. PI31 blocks the ATP-dependent in vitro assembly of 26 S proteasome from 20 S proteasome and PA700 subcomplexes but has no effect on in vitro activity of the intact 26 S proteasome. To determine the physiologic significance of these in vitro effects, we assessed multiple aspects of cellular proteasome content and function after altering PI31 levels. We detected no change in overall cellular proteasome content or function when PI31 levels were either increased by moderate ectopic overexpression or decreased by RNA interference (RNAi). We also failed to identify a role of PI31 ADP-ribosylation as a mechanism for regulation of overall 26 S proteasome content and function, as recently proposed. Thus, despite its in vitro effects on various proteasome activities and its structural relationship to established proteasome regulators, cellular roles and mechanisms of PI31 in regulation of proteasome function remain unclear and require future definition.",Protease Inhibitor;Proteasome;Protein Complex;Protein Degradation;Ubiquitin-dependent Protease;HbYX Motif;PI31

Global DNA methylation, as assessed by 5-methylcytosine staining, was not changed in normal rat kidney cells treated with acute cytotoxic doses of KBrO3 (100 and 200 ppm), as compared with controls. However, KBrO3 treatment did increase p38, p53 and histone 2AX (H2AX) phosphorylation, and p21 expression. Treatment of cells with inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase (5-azacytidine or 5-Aza) and histone deacetylase (trichostatin A or TSA) in addition to KBrO3 increased cytotoxicity, as compared with cells exposed to KBrO3 alone. 5-Aza and TSA co-treatment did not alter p38 or p53 phosphorylation, but slightly decreased H2AX phosphorylation and significantly decreased p21 expression. We also assessed epigenetic changes in cells treated under sub-chronic conditions with environmentally relevant concentrations of KBrO3. Under these conditions (0–10ppm KBrO3 for up to 18 days), we detected no increases in cell death or DNA damage. In contrast, slight alterations were detected in the phosphorylation of H2AX, p38, and p53. Sub-chronic low-dose KBrO3 treatment also induced a biphasic response in p21 expression, with lower concentrations increasing expression, but higher concentrations decreasing expression. Methylation-specific PCR demonstrated that sub-chronic KBrO3 treatment altered the methylation of cytosine bases in the p21 gene, as compared with controls, correlating to alterations in p21 protein expression. Collectively, these data show the novel finding that KBrO3-induced renal cell death is altered by inhibitors of epigenetic modifying enzymes and that KBrO3 itself induces epigenetic changes in the p21 gene.",epigenetics;p21;kidney;nephrotoxicity;bromate;water disinfection byproducts

PTEN mutations are frequent in tumors and in the germ line of patients with tumor predisposition or with neurological or cognitive disorders, which makes the PTEN gene and protein a major focus of interest in current biomedical research. After almost two decades of intense investigation on the 403-residue-long PTEN protein, a previously uncharacterized form of PTEN has been discovered that contains 173 amino-terminal extra amino acids, as a result of an alternate translation initiation site. To facilitate research in the field and to avoid ambiguities in the naming and identification of PTEN amino acids from publications and databases, we propose here a unifying nomenclature and amino acid numbering for this longer form of PTEN.",

Solid-state 13C magic-angle spinning NMR spectroscopy at natural isotopic abundance gives site-specific structural information that can aid in the characterization of complex biomembranes. Using the separated local-field experiment DROSS, we resolved 13C-1H residual dipolar couplings that were interpreted with a statistical mean-torque model. Liquid-disordered and liquid-ordered phases were characterized according to membrane thickness and average cross-sectional area per lipid. Knowledge of such structural parameters is vital for molecular dynamics simulations, and provides information about the balance of forces in membrane lipid bilayers. Experiments were conducted with both phosphatidylcholine (dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC)) and egg-yolk sphingomyelin (EYSM) lipids, and allowed us to extract segmental order parameters from the 13C-1H residual dipolar couplings. Order parameters were used to calculate membrane structural quantities, including the area per lipid and bilayer thickness. Relative to POPC, EYSM is more ordered in the ld phase and experiences less structural perturbation upon adding 50% cholesterol to form the lo phase. The loss of configurational entropy is smaller for EYSM than for POPC, thus favoring its interaction with cholesterol in raftlike lipid systems. Our studies show that solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy is applicable to investigations of complex lipids and makes it possible to obtain structural parameters for biomembrane systems where isotope labeling may be prohibitive.",

There are no therapies that reverse these protein-misfolding events. We aim to apply Hsp104, a hexameric AAA+ protein from yeast, to target misfolded conformers for reactivation. Hsp104 solubilizes disordered aggregates and amyloid, but has limited activity against human neurodegenerative disease proteins. Thus, we have previously engineered potentiated Hsp104 variants that suppress aggregation, proteotoxicity and restore proper protein localization of ALS and PD proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and mitigate neurodegeneration in an animal PD model. Here, we establish that potentiated Hsp104 variants possess broad substrate specificity and, in yeast, suppress toxicity and aggregation induced by wild-type TDP-43, FUS and α-synuclein, as well as missense mutant versions of these proteins that cause neurodegenerative disease. Potentiated Hsp104 variants also rescue toxicity and aggregation of TAF15 but not EWSR1, two RNA-binding proteins with a prion-like domain that are connected with the development of ALS and frontotemporal dementia. Thus, potentiated Hsp104 variants are not entirely non-specific. Indeed, they do not unfold just any natively folded protein. Rather, potentiated Hsp104 variants are finely tuned to unfold proteins bearing short unstructured tracts that are not recognized by wild-type Hsp104.

We demonstrated that negatively charged actin and calmodulin (CaM), as well as basic histone H1.3, inhibit MBP hydrolysis by competing with the proteasome and MBP, respectively, for binding their counterpart.

Furthermore, ncRNAs play an important role in normal development and their expression levels are dysregulated in several diseases. Recently, several long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to alter the epigenetic status of genomic loci and suppress the expression of target genes. This review will present examples of such a mechanism and focus on the potential to target lncRNAs for achieving therapeutic gene upregulation by de-repressing genes that are epigenetically silenced in various diseases. Finally, the potential to target lncRNAs, through their interactions with epigenetic enzymes, using various tools, such as small molecules, viral vectors and antisense oligonucleotides, will be discussed.

Here we investigated the diversity displayed in 104 nuclear-coded mitochondrial proteins from 1,092 individuals from the 1000 Genomes dataset, in order to evaluate if these genes are under the effects of purifying selection and how that selection compares with their mitochondrial encoded counterparts. Only the very rare variants (frequency < 0.1%) in these nDNA genes are indistinguishable from a random set from all possible variants in terms of predicted pathogenicity score, but more frequent variants display distinct signs of purifying selection. Comparisons of selection strength indicate stronger selection in the mtDNA genes compared to this set of nDNA genes, accounted for by the high hydrophobicity of the proteins coded by the mtDNA. Most of the predicted pathogenic variants in the nDNA genes were restricted to a single continental population. The proportion of individuals having at least one potential pathogenic mutation in this gene set was significantly lower in Europeans than in Africans and Asians. This difference may reflect demographic asymmetries, since African and Asian populations experienced main expansions in middle Holocene, while in Europeans the main expansions occurred earlier in the post-glacial period.",

In addition, SR proteins are now implicated in many aspects of mRNA and ncRNA processing well beyond splicing. These unexpected roles, including RNA transcription, export, translation and decay may prove to be the rule rather than the exception. To simply define this family of RNA binding proteins as splicing factors belies the broader roles of SR proteins in post-transcriptional gene expression.",

CaM has been proposed to be functionally distinct from the S100 proteins, a related family of eukaryotic calcium-binding proteins. Previously, it was demonstrated that peptides derived from the actin-capping protein, TRTK12, and the tumor-suppressor protein, p53, interact with multiple members of the S100 proteins. To test the specificity of these peptides, they were screened using isothermal titration calorimetry against 16 members of the human S100 protein family, as well as CaM, which served as a negative control. Interestingly, both the TRTK12 and p53 peptides were found to interact with CaM. These interactions were further confirmed by both fluorescence and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies. These peptides have distinct sequences from the known CaM target sequences. The TRTK12 peptide was found to independently interact with both CaM domains and bind with a stoichiometry of 2:1 and dissociations constants Kd,C-term = 2 ± 1 µM and Kd,N-term = 14 ± 1 µM. In contrast, the p53 peptide was found to interact only with the C-terminal domain of CaM, Kd,C-term =2 ± 1 µM, 25°C. Using NMR spectroscopy, the locations of the peptide binding sites were mapped onto the structure of CaM. The binding sites for both peptides were found to overlap with the binding interface for previously identified targets on both domains of CaM. This study demonstrates the plasticity of CaM in target binding and may suggest a possible overlap in target specificity between CaM and the S100 proteins.",S100 proteins;calmodulin;isothermal titration calorimetry;nuclear magnetic resonance;line-shape analysis;p53;TRTK12;CapZ

While the function of chaperones in protein folding has been well documented over the last four decades, more recent studies have shown that chaperones are also necessary for the clearance of terminally misfolded proteins by the Ub-proteasome system. In this capacity, chaperones protect misfolded degradation substrates from spontaneous aggregation, facilitate their recognition by the Ub ligation machinery and finally shuttle the ubiquitylated substrates to the proteasome. The physiological importance of these functions is manifested by inefficient proteasomal degradation and the accumulation of protein aggregates during ageing or in certain neurodegenerative diseases, when chaperone levels decline. In this review, we focus on the diverse roles of stress-induced chaperones in targeting misfolded proteins to the proteasome and the consequences of their compromised activity.

A major challenge is to predict the effects of these Indels and to distinguish between deleterious and neutral variants.

TLQP-21 is found in the sympathetic nerve terminals in the adipose tissue and targets the G-protein-coupled-receptor (GPCR) Complement-3a-Receptor1 (C3aR1). So far, the mechanisms of TLQP-21-induced receptor activation remained unexplored. Here, we report that TLQP-21 is intrinsically disordered and undergoes a disorder-to-order transition, adopting an α-helical conformation, upon targeting cells expressing the C3aR1. We determined that the hot spots for TLQP-21 are located at the C-terminus, with mutations in the last four amino acids progressively reducing the bioactivity and, a single site mutation (R21A) or C-terminal amidation abolishing its function completely. Interestingly, the human TLQP-21 sequence carrying a S20A substitution activates the human C3aR1 receptor with lower potency compared to the rodent sequence. These studies reveal the mechanism of action of TLQP-21 and provide molecular templates for designing agonists and antagonists to modulate C3aR1 functions.",Adipocyte;Alanine scanning;Lipolysis;Solid-state NMR;VGF

Targeted deletion of mouse tropomodulin3 (Tmod3) leads to embryonic lethality at E14.5-E18.5, with anemia due to defects in definitive erythropoiesis in the fetal liver. Erythroid burst-forming unit and colony-forming unit numbers are greatly reduced, indicating defects in progenitor populations. Flow cytometry of fetal liver erythroblasts shows that late-stage populations are also decreased, including reduced percentages of enucleated cells. Annexin V staining indicates increased apoptosis of Tmod3−/− erythroblasts, and cell-cycle analysis reveals that there are more Ter119hi cells in S-phase in Tmod3−/− embryos. Notably, enucleating Tmod3−/− erythroblasts are still in the process of proliferation, suggesting impaired cell-cycle exit during terminal differentiation. Tmod3−/− late erythroblasts often exhibit multilobular nuclear morphologies and aberrant F-actin assembly during enucleation. Furthermore, native erythroblastic island formation was impaired in Tmod3−/− fetal livers, with Tmod3 required in both erythroblasts and macrophages. In conclusion, disruption of Tmod3 leads to impaired definitive erythropoiesis due to reduced progenitors, impaired erythroblastic island formation, and defective erythroblast cell-cycle progression and enucleation. Tmod3-mediated actin remodeling may be required for erythroblast-macrophage adhesion, coordination of cell cycle with differentiation, and F-actin assembly and remodeling during erythroblast enucleation.",

Previously, we have shown the strong anti-HIV-1 activity of prothymosin α (ProTα) derived from CD8+ T cells. ProTα is a small acidic protein with wide cell distribution, to which several functions have been ascribed, depending on its intracellular or extracellular localization. To date, activities of ProTα have been attributed to a single protein known as isoform 2. Here we report the isolation and identification of 2 new ProTα variants from CD8+ T cells and cervicovaginal lavage with potent anti-HIV-1 activity. The first is a splice variant of the ProTα gene, known as isoform CRA_b, and the second is the product of a ProTα gene, thus far classified as a pseudogene 7. Native or recombinant ProTα variants potently restrict HIV-1 replication in macrophages through the induction of type I interferon. The baseline expression of interferon-responsive genes in primary human cervical tissues positively correlate with high levels of intracellular ProTα, and the knockdown of ProTα variants by small interfering RNA leads to downregulation of interferon target genes. Overall, these findings suggest that ProTα variants are innate immune mediators involved in immune surveillance.",prothymosin alpha;macrophages;cervicovaginal lavage;HIV-1;CD8+ T cells

In addition, natural adenoviruses pose severe risks for immunocompromised people, yet infections are usually mild and self-limiting in immunocompetent individuals. Here we describe how adenoviruses are recognized by the host innate defense system during entry and replication in immune and nonimmune cells. Innate defense protects the host and represents a major barrier to using adenoviruses as therapeutic interventions in humans. Innate response against adenoviruses involves intrinsic factors present at constant levels, and innate factors mounted by the host cell upon viral challenge. These factors exert antiviral effects by directly binding to viruses or viral components, or shield the virus, for example, soluble factors, such as blood clotting components, the complement system, preexisting immunoglobulins, or defensins. In addition, Toll-like receptors and lectins in the plasma membrane and endosomes are intrinsic factors against adenoviruses. Important innate factors restricting adenovirus in the cytosol are tripartite motif-containing proteins, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like inflammatory receptors, and DNA sensors triggering interferon, such as DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box polypeptide 41 and cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate synthase. Adenovirus tunes the function of antiviral autophagy, and counters innate defense by virtue of its early proteins E1A, E1B, E3, and E4 and two virus-associated noncoding RNAs VA-I and VA-II. We conclude by discussing strategies to engineer adenovirus vectors with attenuated innate responses and enhanced delivery features.",

Ubiquitin is recognized by a series of complexes that operate at a number of vesicle transport steps. Ubiquitin serves as a sorting signal for internalization at the plasma membrane and is the major signal for incorporation into intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular late endosomes. The sorting machineries that catalyze these steps can bind Ub via a variety of Ub-binding domains. At the same time, many of these complexes are themselves ubiquitinated, thus providing a plethora of potential mechanisms to regulate their activity.

However, its conformation upon nucleosome binding and its impact on chromatin organization remain unknown. Our mesoscale chromatin model with a flexible LH CTD captures a dynamic, salt-dependent condensation mechanism driven by charge neutralization between the LH and linker DNA. Namely, at low salt concentration, CTD condenses, but LH only interacts with the nucleosome and one linker DNA, resulting in a semi-open nucleosome configuration; at higher salt, LH interacts with the nucleosome and two linker DNAs, promoting stem formation and chromatin compaction. CTD charge reduction unfolds the domain and decondenses chromatin, a mechanism in consonance with reduced counterion screening in vitro and phosphorylated LH in vivo. Divalent ions counteract this decondensation effect by maintaining nucleosome stems and expelling the CTDs to the fiber exterior. Additionally, we explain that the CTD folding depends on the chromatin fiber size, and we show that the asymmetric structure of the LH globular head is responsible for the uneven interaction observed between the LH and the linker DNAs. All these mechanisms may impact epigenetic regulation and higher levels of chromatin folding.",

Their ability to stabilize highly abundant histone proteins in the cellular environment prevents non-specific interactions and promotes nucleosome formation, but the various mechanisms for doing so are not well understood. We now focus on the dynamic features of the DAXX histone chaperone that have been elusive from previous structural studies. Using hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (H/DX-MS), we elucidate the concerted binding-folding of DAXX with histone variants H3.3/H4 and H3.2/H4 and find that high local stability at the variant-specific recognition residues rationalizes its known selectivity for H3.3. We show that the DAXX histone binding domain is largely disordered in solution and that formation of the H3.3/H4/DAXX complex induces folding and dramatic global stabilization of both histone and chaperone. Thus, DAXX uses a novel strategy as a molecular chaperone that paradoxically couples its own folding to substrate recognition and binding. Further, we propose a model for the chromatin assembly reaction it mediates, including a stepwise folding pathway that helps explain the fidelity of DAXX in associating with the H3.3 variant, despite an extensive and nearly identical binding surface on its counterparts, H3.1 and H3.2.",

Quantitative analyses revealed that the occurrence of the bulbs correlated with the amount of GFP. Next, we prepared a construct of H+-PPase linked with a nondimerizing GFP (mGFP); we detected no bulbs. These results indicate that the membranes adhere face-to-face by antiparallel dimerization of GFP, resulting in the formation of bulbs.

This energy depletion negatively affects ATP-dependent chaperone systems, making ROS-mediated protein unfolding and aggregation a potentially very challenging problem. Here we show that Get3, a protein involved in ATP-dependent targeting of tail-anchored (TA) proteins under non-stress conditions, turns into an effective ATP-in dependent chaperone when oxidized. Activation of Get3’s chaperone function, which is a fully reversible process, involves disulfide bond formation, metal release and its conversion into distinct, higher oligomeric structures. Mutational studies demonstrate that the chaperone activity of Get3 is functionally distinct from and likely mutually exclusive with its targeting function, and responsible for the oxidative stress sensitive phenotype that has long been noted for yeast cells lacking functional Get3. These results provide convincing evidence that Get3 functions as a redox regulated chaperone, effectively protecting eukaryotic cells against oxidative protein damage.",

We have shown that Gemin5 interacts with internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements and modulates initiation of translation. However, little is known about the RNA-binding sites of this protein. Here we show that the C-terminal region of Gemin5 bears two non-canonical bipartite RNA-binding sites, encompassing amino acids 1297–1412 (RBS1) and 1383–1508 (RBS2). While RBS1 exhibits greater affinity for RNA than RBS2, it does not affect IRES-dependent translation in G5-depleted cells. In solution, the RBS1 three-dimensional structure behaves as an ensemble of flexible conformations rather than having a defined tertiary structure. However, expression of the polypeptide G51383–1508, bearing the low RNA-binding affinity RBS2, repressed IRES-dependent translation. A comparison of the RNA-binding capacity and translation control properties of constructs expressed in mammalian cells to that of the Gemin5 proteolysis products observed in infected cells reveals that non-repressive products accumulated during infection while the repressor polypeptide is not stable. Taken together, our results define the low affinity RNA-binding site as the minimal element of the protein being able to repress internal initiation of translation.",

Moreover, we found that they interacted with SnRK1, which phosphorylated AtREM4.1, and were degraded by the 26S proteasome pathway.

The study of dynamic interactions between proteins and their cognate ligands is therefore fundamental to the understanding of biological systems. During the last two decades MS, and its associated techniques, has become accepted as a method for the study of protein–ligand interactions, not only for covalent complexes, where the use of MS is well established, but also, and significantly for protein–ligand interactions, for noncovalent assemblies. In this review, we employ a broad definition of a ligand to encompass protein subunits, drug molecules, oligonucleotides, carbohydrates, and lipids. Under the appropriate conditions, MS can reveal the composition, heterogeneity and dynamics of these protein–ligand interactions, and in some cases their structural arrangements and binding affinities. Herein, we highlight MS approaches for studying protein–ligand complexes, including those containing integral membrane subunits, and showcase examples from recent literature. Specifically, we tabulate the myriad of methodologies, including hydrogen exchange, proteomics, hydroxyl radical footprinting, intact complexes, and crosslinking, which, when combined with MS, provide insights into conformational changes and subtle modifications in response to ligand‐binding interactions.",crosslinking;hydrogen–deuterium exchange;hydroxyl radical footprinting;MS;protein complexes;protein–ligand interactions;proteomics

IAPP is a fascinating molecule and a very challenging experimental
system. Amyloid deposits in the pancreas were first reported in 1901,
but it was not until more than 80 years later, in 1987, that the protein
component of islet amyloid was described.12−14 The culprit,
IAPP, is a 37 residue polypeptide hormone. In normal individuals,
soluble IAPP plays a role in regulating metabolism, but it forms pancreatic
amyloid by an unknown mechanism in type-2 diabetes.15,16 Pancreatic amyloidosis leads to β-cell dysfunction, β-cell
apoptosis and cell death, as well as islet transplant failure.15,16 The peptide is extremely amyloidogenic, and it aggregates aggressively
in vitro; indeed, it is even more prone to aggregate than Aβ.
These factors make it challenging to study, and thus, IAPP self-assembly
is less well-defined than that of Aβ. The developments and new
methods highlighted in the three Perspectives in this volume, together
with other advances, hold the promise of shedding more light on amyloid
formation by IAPP and other proteins. Many of the methods and approaches
outlined in these articles can be applied to more general problems
in protein aggregation.",

The conservation of the PriCT domain in the C termini of some archaeo-eukaryotic primases indicates that it probably plays a similar role in these proteins.

To identify potential factors that might have played a role in such a transition, three key domains of the vertebrate tooth enamel protein amelogenin were probed for calcium mineral/protein interactions and their ability to promote calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate crystal growth. Under calcium phosphate crystal growth conditions, only the carboxy-terminus augmented polyproline repeat peptide, but not the N-terminal peptide nor the polyproline repeat peptide alone, promoted the formation of thin and parallel crystallites resembling those of bone and initial enamel. In contrast, under calcium carbonate crystal growth conditions, all three amelogenin-derived polypeptides caused calcium carbonate to form fused crystalline conglomerates. When examined for long-term crystal growth, polyproline repeat peptides of increasing length promoted the growth of shorter calcium carbonate crystals with broader basis, contrary to the positive correlation between polyproline repeat element length and apatite mineralization published earlier. To determine whether the positive correlation between polyproline repeat element length and apatite crystal growth versus the inverse correlation between polyproline repeat length and calcium carbonate crystal growth were related to the binding affinity of the polyproline domain to either apatite or carbonate, a parallel series of calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate/apatite protein binding studies was conducted. These studies demonstrated a remarkable binding affinity between the augmented amelogenin polyproline repeat region and calcium phosphates, and almost no binding to calcium carbonates. In contrast, the amelogenin N-terminus bound to both carbonate and apatite, but preferentially to calcium carbonate. Together, these studies highlight the specific binding affinity of the augmented amelogenin polyproline repeat region to calcium phosphates versus calcium carbonate, and its unique role in the growth of thin apatite crystals as they occur in vertebrate biominerals. Our data suggest that the rise of apatite-based biominerals in vertebrates might have been facilitated by a rapid evolution of specialized polyproline repeat proteins flanked by a charged domain, resulting in apatite crystals with reduced width, increased length, and tailored biomechanical properties.",amelogenin;hydroxyapatite;calcium carbonate;polyproline repeat proteins;vertebrate evolution

Tissue-specific processing of proglucagon yields three major peptide hormones as follows: glucagon in the α cells and glucagon-like peptides (GLP)-1 and -2 in the L cells and neurons. Efficient sorting and packaging into the secretory granules of the regulated secretory pathway in each cell type are required for nutrient-regulated secretion of these proglucagon-derived peptides. Our previous work suggested that proglucagon is directed into granules by intrinsic sorting signals after initial processing to glicentin and major proglucagon fragment (McGirr, R., Guizzetti, L., and Dhanvantari, S. (2013) J. Endocrinol. 217, 229–240), leading to the hypothesis that sorting signals may be present in multiple domains. In the present study, we show that the α-helices within glucagon and GLP-1, but not GLP-2, act as sorting signals by efficiently directing a heterologous secretory protein to the regulated secretory pathway. Biophysical characterization of these peptides revealed that glucagon and GLP-1 each encode a nonamphipathic, dipolar α-helix, whereas the helix in GLP-2 is not dipolar. Surprisingly, glicentin and major proglucagon fragment were sorted with different efficiencies, thus providing evidence that proglucagon is first sorted to granules prior to processing. In contrast to many other prohormones in which sorting is directed by ordered prodomains, the sorting determinants of proglucagon lie within the ordered hormone domains of glucagon and GLP-1, illustrating that each prohormone has its own sorting “signature.”",Confocal Microscopy;Intracellular Trafficking;Peptide Hormones;Protein Secretion;Protein Sorting;GLP-1;Dipolar α-Helix;Glucagon;Proglucagon;Secretory Granules

In most of these experiments, the NMR data collection time is ultimately governed by the proton spin-lattice relaxation times (T1). For over two decades, gadolinium(III)-DTPA (Gd-DTPA, DTPA = Diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid) has been one of the most widely used contrast-enhancement agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this study, we demonstrate that Gd-DTPA can also be effectively used to enhance the longitudinal relaxation rates of protons in solid-state NMR experiments conducted on bone without significant line-broadening and chemical-shift-perturbation side effects. Using bovine cortical bone samples incubated in different concentrations of Gd-DTPA complex, the 1H T1 values were calculated from data collected by 1H spin-inversion recovery method detected in natural-abundance 13C cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) NMR experiments. Our results reveal that the 1H T1 values can be successfully reduced by a factor of 3.5 using as low as 10 mM Gd-DTPA without reducing the spectral resolution and thus enabling faster data acquisition of the 13C CPMAS spectra. These results obtained from 13C-detected CPMAS experiments were further confirmed using 1H-detected ultrafast MAS experiments on Gd-DTPA doped bone samples. This approach considerably improves the signal-to-noise ratio per unit time of NMR experiments applied to bone samples by reducing the experimental time required to acquire the same number of scans.",Solid-state NMR;paramagnetic relaxation enhancement;ultrafast MAS;Gd-DTPA;Bone

Small molecules have serious limitations: drugs of this type can be fairly good enzyme inhibitors, receptor ligands, or allosteric modulators. However, most cellular functions are mediated by protein interactions with other proteins, and targeting protein–protein interactions by small molecules presents challenges that are unlikely to be overcome with these compounds as the only tools. Recent advances in gene delivery techniques and characterization of cell type-specific promoters open the prospect of using reengineered signaling-biased proteins as next-generation therapeutics. The first steps in targeted engineering of proteins with desired functional characteristics look very promising. As quintessential scaffolds that act strictly via interactions with other proteins in the cell, arrestins represent a perfect model for the development of these novel therapeutic agents with enormous potential: custom-designed signaling proteins will allow us to tell the cell what to do and when to do it in a way it cannot disobey.",Drugs;Small molecules;Enzyme inhibitors;Receptor ligands;Signaling scaffolds;Protein-based therapeutics

It is generally believed that the vast majority of tau molecules decorate axonal microtubules, thereby stabilizing them. However, it is an open question how tau can regulate microtubule dynamics without impeding microtubule-dependent transport and how tau is also available for interactions other than those with microtubules. Here we address this apparent paradox by fast single-molecule tracking of tau in living neurons and Monte Carlo simulations of tau dynamics. We find that tau dwells on a single microtubule for an unexpectedly short time of ∼40 ms before it hops to the next. This dwell time is 100-fold shorter than previously reported by ensemble measurements. Furthermore, we observed by quantitative imaging using fluorescence decay after photoactivation recordings of photoactivatable GFP–tagged tubulin that, despite this rapid dynamics, tau is capable of regulating the tubulin–microtubule balance. This indicates that tau's dwell time on microtubules is sufficiently long to influence the lifetime of a tubulin subunit in a GTP cap. Our data imply a novel kiss-and-hop mechanism by which tau promotes neuronal microtubule assembly. The rapid kiss-and-hop interaction explains why tau, although binding to microtubules, does not interfere with axonal transport.",

As archaea include extremophiles that can withstand diverse environmental stresses, they provide fundamental systems for understanding enzymes and pathways critical to genome integrity and stress responses. Such archaeal extremophiles provide critical data on the periodic table for life as well as on the biochemical, geochemical, and physical limitations to adaptive strategies allowing organisms to thrive under environmental stress relevant to determining the boundaries for life as we know it. Specifically, archaeal enzyme structures have informed the architecture and mechanisms of key DNA repair proteins and complexes. With added abilities to temperature-trap flexible complexes and reveal core domains of transient and dynamic complexes, these structures provide insights into mechanisms of maintaining genome integrity despite extreme environmental stress. The DNA damage response protein structures noted in this review therefore inform the basis for genome integrity in the face of environmental stress, with implications for all domains of life as well as for biomanufacturing, astrobiology, and medicine.",

Recently, several publications have begun to elucidate mechanisms of quality control that operate at the plasma membrane (PM), recognizing misfolded PM proteins and targeting their endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation.

We examined Pax-6 variations in the squid and found five types of Pax-6 splicing variants but no duplication of the Pax-6 gene.

This work extends previous EPR and XAS analysis in which, in contrast, the effect of adding Zn(II) to Cu(II)–tetra-octarepeat complexes was investigated. Detailed structural analysis of the XAS spectra taken at both the Cu and Zn K-edge when the two metals are present at different relative concentrations revealed that Zn(II) and Cu(II) ions compete for binding to the tetra-octarepeat peptide by cross-regulating their relative binding modes. We show that the specific metal–peptide coordination mode depends not only, as expected, on the relative metal concentrations, but also on whether Zn(II) or Cu(II) was first bound to the peptide. In particular, it seems that the Zn(II) binding mode in the absence of Cu(II) is able to promote the formation of small peptide clusters in which triplets of tetra-octarepeats are bridged by pairs of Zn ions. When Cu(II) is added, it starts competing with Zn(II) for binding, disrupting the existing peptide cluster arrangement, despite the fact that Cu(II) is unable to completely displace Zn(II). These results may have a bearing on our understanding of peptide-aggregation processes and, with the delicate cross-regulation balancing we have revealed, seem to suggest the existence of an interesting, finely tuned interplay among metal ions affecting protein binding, capable of providing a mechanism for regulation of metal concentration in cells.",Prion protein;XAS;Metal homeostasis

Despite substantial progress in the models and algorithms used in many areas of computational biology, such comparisons sometimes reveal that the computations are not in quantitative agreement with experimental data. The principle of maximum entropy is a general procedure for constructing probability distributions in the light of new data, making it a natural tool in cases when an initial model provides results that are at odds with experiments. The number of maximum entropy applications in our field has grown steadily in recent years, in areas as diverse as sequence analysis, structural modelling, and neurobiology. In this Perspectives article, we give a broad introduction to the method, in an attempt to encourage its further adoption. The general procedure is explained in the context of a simple example, after which we proceed with a real-world application in the field of molecular simulations, where the maximum entropy procedure has recently provided new insight. Given the limited accuracy of force fields, macromolecular simulations sometimes produce results that are at not in complete and quantitative accordance with experiments. A common solution to this problem is to explicitly ensure agreement between the two by perturbing the potential energy function towards the experimental data. So far, a general consensus for how such perturbations should be implemented has been lacking. Three very recent papers have explored this problem using the maximum entropy approach, providing both new theoretical and practical insights to the problem. We highlight each of these contributions in turn and conclude with a discussion on remaining challenges.",

In HspB1, HspB3, and HspB8 all known mutations cause motor neuropathies, whereas in HspB5 they cause myopathies. Several features are common to the majority of these mutations: (i) they are missense mutations, (ii) most associated disease phenotypes exhibit a dominant inheritance pattern and late disease onset, (iii) in the primary protein sequences, the sites of most mutations are located in the conserved α-crystallin domain and the variable C-terminal extensions, and (iv) most human mutation sites are highly conserved among the vertebrate orthologs and have been historically exposed to significant purifying selection. In contrast, a minor fraction of these mutations deviate from these rules: they are (i) frame shifting, nonsense, or elongation mutations, (ii) associated with recessive or early onset disease phenotypes, (iii) positioned in the N-terminal domain of the proteins, and (iv) less conserved among the vertebrates and were historically not subject to a strong selective pressure. In several vertebrate sHSPs (including primate sHSPs), homologous sites differ from the human sequence and occasionally even encode the same amino acid residues that cause the disease in humans. Apparently, a number of these mutations sites are not crucial for the protein function in single species or entire taxa, and single species even seem to have adopted mechanisms that compensate for potentially adverse effects of 'mutant-like' sHSPs. The disease-associated dominant sHSP missense mutations have a number of cellular consequences that are consistent with gain-of-function mechanisms of genetic dominance: dominant-negative effects, the formation of cytotoxic amyloid protein oligomers and precipitates, disruption of cytoskeletal networks, and increased downstream enzymatic activities. Future therapeutic concepts should aim for reducing these adverse effects of mutant sHSPs in patients. Indeed, initial experimental results are encouraging.",small heat shock protein;mutation;motor neuropathy;myopathy;purifying selection;genetic dominance

Goldenberg: ude.hatu.ygoloib@grebnedlog ;∗Corresponding author ude.hatu.ygoloib@grebnedlog","Small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) was used to study the behavior of equine metmyoglobin (Mb) and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) at concentrations up to 0.4 and 0.15 g/mL, respectively, in solutions also containing 50% D2O and 1 M urea. For both proteins, significant effects because of interference between x-rays scattered by different molecules (interparticle interference) were observed, indicating nonideal behavior at high concentrations. The experimental data were analyzed by comparison of the observed scattering profiles with those predicted by crystal structures of the proteins and a hard-sphere fluid model used to represent steric exclusion effects. The Mb scattering data were well fit by the hard-sphere model using a sphere radius of 18 Å, only slightly smaller than that estimated from the three-dimensional structure (20 Å). In contrast, the scattering profiles for BPTI in phosphate buffer displayed substantially less pronounced interparticle interference than predicted by the hard-sphere model and the radius estimated from the known structure of the protein (15 Å). Replacing the phosphate buffer with 3-(N-morpolino)propane sulfonic acid (MOPS) led to increased interparticle interference, consistent with a larger effective radius and suggesting that phosphate ions may mediate attractive intermolecular interactions, as observed in some BPTI crystal structures, without the formation of stable oligomers. The scattering data were also used to estimate second virial coefficients for the two proteins: 2.0 ×10-4 cm3mol/g2 for Mb in phosphate buffer, 1.6 ×10-4 cm3mol/g2 for BPTI in phosphate buffer and 9.2 ×10-4 cm3mol/g2 for BPTI in MOPS. The results indicate that the behavior of Mb, which is nearly isoelectric under the conditions used, is well described by the hard-sphere model, but that of BPTI is considerably more complex and is likely influenced by both repulsive and attractive electrostatic interactions. The hard-sphere model may be a generally useful tool for the analysis of small-angle scattering data from concentrated macromolecular solutions.",

Chazinude.tlibrednav@nizahc.retlaW","DNA replication, damage response and repair require the coordinated action of multi-domain proteins operating within dynamic multi-protein machines that act upon the DNA substrate. These modular proteins contain flexible linkers of various lengths, which enable changes in the spatial distribution of the globular domains (architecture) that harbor their essential biochemical functions. This mobile architecture is uniquely suited to follow the evolving substrate landscape present over the course of the specific process performed by the multi-protein machinery. A fundamental advance in understanding of protein machinery is the realization of the pervasive role of dynamics. Not only is the machine undergoing dynamic transformations, but the proteins themselves are flexible and constantly adapting to the progression through the steps of the overall process. Within this dynamic context the activity of the constituent proteins must be coordinated, a role typically played by hub proteins. A number of important characteristics of modular proteins and concepts about the operation of dynamic machinery have been discerned. These provide the underlying basis for the action of the machinery that reads DNA, and responds to and repairs DNA damage. Here, we introduce a number of key characteristics and concepts, including the modularity of the proteins, linkage of weak binding sites, direct competition between sites, and allostery, using the well recognized hub protein replication protein A (RPA).",DNA repair;DNA replication;multi-protein machinery;replication protein A;allostery;DNA mimicry;multivalent interactions

To our knowledge, this is the first report of optical, label-free characterization of biomolecular translocation at millisecond time resolution using an array of synthetic nanopores. Our method uses fluorescence measurements to optically access the same information that can be attained through electrical current measurements. This technique may be of particular importance when low salt concentration is necessary, as all optical measurements here were performed with only 65 mM of CaCl2. Notably, this concentration of calcium is compatible with the ϕ29 polymerase used in certain nanopore sequencing platforms36,39 (see Supporting Information for details). If the desired system does not require such proteins, the calcium concentration used may be easily increased to attain a higher signal-to-noise ratio. This system may also be useful for simultaneously characterizing translocation dynamics of an analyte molecule through various pore diameters, as pores of varying sizes can be easily incorporated into the platform. We note that our system used epi-fluorescence illumination and an electron-multiplying CCD (emCCD) for detection, both of which can be improved upon in a more dedicated system by choosing the appropriate conditions (e.g., sheet illumination and APD array detection). Finally, under the appropriate illumination/detection conditions, scaling up to a large array of small pores (which can be slow using TEM-based fabrication)49 should be possible using recently demonstrated pore arrays that were fabricated using a scanning ion beam.50",nanopore;ionophore;fluorescence;single-molecule;optical patch-clamping

Many studies based on single-molecule techniques have shed light on conformational dynamics and contributed to a better understanding of living matter. In particular, single-molecule FRET experiments have revealed unprecedented information at various time scales varying from milliseconds to seconds. The choice and the attachment of fluorophores is a pivotal requirement for single-molecule FRET experiments. One particularly well-studied millisecond conformational change is the opening and closing of DNA hairpin structures. In this study, we addressed the influence of base- and terminal-labeled fluorophores as well as the fluorophore DNA interactions on the extracted kinetic information of the DNA hairpin. Gibbs free energies varied from ∆G0 = −3.6 kJ/mol to ∆G0 = −0.2 kJ/mol for the identical DNA hairpin modifying only the labeling scheme and design of the DNA sample. In general, the base-labeled DNA hairpin is significantly destabilized compared to the terminal-labeled DNA hairpin and fluorophore DNA interactions additionally stabilize the closed state of the DNA hairpin.

We have used 15N labeling of barley (Hordeum vulgare) plants and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of free amino acids and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of proteins to track the enrichment of 15N into the amino acid pools in barley leaves and then into tryptic peptides derived from newly synthesized proteins. Using information on the rate of growth of barley leaves combined with the rate of degradation of 14N-labeled proteins, we calculate the turnover rates of 508 different proteins in barley and show that they vary by more than 100-fold. There was approximately a 9-h lag from label application until 15N incorporation could be reliably quantified in extracted peptides. Using this information and assuming constant translation rates for proteins during the time course, we were able to quantify degradation rates for several proteins that exhibit half-lives on the order of hours. Our workflow, involving a stringent series of mass spectrometry filtering steps, demonstrates that 15N labeling can be used for large-scale liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry studies of protein turnover in plants. We identify a series of abundant proteins in photosynthesis, photorespiration, and specific subunits of chlorophyll biosynthesis that turn over significantly more rapidly than the average protein involved in these processes. We also highlight a series of proteins that turn over as rapidly as the well-known D1 subunit of photosystem II. While these proteins need further verification for rapid degradation in vivo, they cluster in chlorophyll and thiamine biosynthesis.",

In a force-free approach to measuring molecular-level interaction via the surface water diffusivity, different mussel foot proteins were found to have differential abilities to evict hydration layers from the surfaces—a necessary step for adsorption and adhesion. It was anticipated that Dopa would mediate dehydration given its efficacy forbio-inspired wet adhesion. Instead, hydrophobic side-chains are found to be a critical component in bringing about protein-surface intimacy. This is the first direct measurement of interfacial water dynamics during force-free adsorptive interactions at solid surfaces, and offers guidance for engineering wet adhesives and coatings.",ESR spectroscopy;dynamic nuclear polarization;hydrophobic effect;mussel foot proteins;wet adhesion

The mechanisms that trigger protein misfolding and aggregation are still not fully understood. Increasing experimental evidence indicates that abnormal interactions between PMD-related proteins and nucleic acids (NAs) can induce conformational changes. Here, we discuss these protein–NA interactions and address the role of deoxyribonucleic (DNA) and ribonucleic (RNA) acid molecules in the conformational conversion of different proteins that aggregate in PMDs, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and prion diseases. Studies on the affinity, stability, and specificity of proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases and NAs are specifically addressed. A landscape of reciprocal effects resulting from the binding of prion proteins, amyloid-β peptides, tau proteins, huntingtin, and α-synuclein are presented here to clarify the possible role of NAs, not only as encoders of genetic information but also in triggering PMDs.",Protein aggregation;Protein misfolding;Protein–nucleic acid interaction;Degenerative diseases;Conformational conversion

Because ETD can break covalent bonds while minimally disrupting non-covalent interactions, we have investigated the ability of this dissociation technique together with CID to probe the sites of electrostatic interactions in gas phase protein ions. By comparing spectra from ETD with spectra from ETD followed by CID, we find that several proteins, including ubiquitin, CRABP I, azurin, and β-2-microglobulin, appear to maintain many of the salt bridge contacts known to exist in solution. To support this conclusion, we also performed calculations to consider all possible salt bridge patterns for each protein, and we find that the native salt bridge pattern explains the experimental ETD data better than nearly all other possible salt bridge patterns. Overall, our data suggest that ETD and ETD/CID of native protein ions can provide some insight into approximate location of salt bridges in the gas phase.",Electron transfer dissociation;collision-induced dissociation;native electrospray ionization;gas phase;protein ions;salt bridges

These motifs often comprise peptides of less than 10 amino acids that modulate protein–protein interactions. While well-characterized in eukaryotic intracellular signaling, their role in prokaryotic signaling is less well-understood. We surveyed the distribution of known motifs in prokaryotic extracellular and virulence proteins across a range of bacterial species and conducted searches for novel motifs in virulence proteins. Many known motifs in virulence effector proteins mimic eukaryotic motifs and enable the pathogen to control the intracellular processes of their hosts. Novel motifs were detected by finding those that had evolved independently in three or more unrelated virulence proteins. The search returned several significantly over-represented linear motifs of which some were known motifs and others are novel candidates with potential roles in bacterial pathogenesis. A putative C-terminal G[AG].$ motif found in type IV secretion system proteins was among the most significant detected. A KK$ motif that has been previously identified in a plasminogen-binding protein, was demonstrated to be enriched across a number of adhesion and lipoproteins. While there is some potential to develop peptide drugs against bacterial infection based on bacterial peptides that mimic host components, this could have unwanted effects on host signaling. Thus, novel SLiMs in virulence factors that do not mimic host components but are crucial for bacterial pathogenesis, such as the type IV secretion system, may be more useful to develop as leads for anti-microbial peptides or drugs.",short linear motifs (SLiMs);virulence factor;motif mimicry;antibacterial;bioinformatics;pathogen

Antigen receptor gene assembly proceeds through DNA DSB intermediates generated in G1-phase lymphocytes by the RAG endonuclease. These DSBs activate ATM, which phosphorylates H2AX, forming γ-H2AX in flanking chromatin. γ-H2AX prevents CtIP from initiating resection of RAG DSBs. Whether there are additional proteins required to promote resection of these DNA ends is not known. KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP-1) (TRIM28) is a transcriptional repressor that modulates chromatin structure and has been implicated in the repair of DNA DSBs in heterochromatin. Here, we show that in murine G1-phase lymphocytes, KAP-1 promotes resection of DSBs that are not protected by H2AX and its downstream effector 53BP1. In these murine cells, KAP-1 activity in DNA end resection is attenuated by a single-amino-acid change that reflects a KAP-1 polymorphism between primates and other mammalian species. These findings establish KAP-1 as a component of the machinery that can resect DNA ends in G1-phase cells and suggest that there may be species-specific features to this activity.",

The mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene is also frequently involved in chromosomal translocations or partial tandem duplication in acute leukemia. The MLL protein interacts with RUNX1 and prevents RUNX1 from ubiquitin-mediated degradation. RUNX1/CBFβ recruits MLL to regulate downstream target genes. However, the functional consequence of MLL fusions on RUNX1/CBFβ activity has not been fully understood. In this report, we show that MLL fusion proteins and the N-terminal MLL portion of MLL fusions downregulate RUNX1 and CBFβ protein expression via the MLL CXXC domain and flanking regions. We confirmed this finding in Mll-Af9 knock-in mice and human M4/M5 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, with or without MLL translocations, showing that MLL translocations cause a hypomorph phenotype of RUNX1/CBFβ. Overexpression of RUNX1 inhibits the development of AML in Mll-Af9 knock-in mice; conversely, further reducing Runx1/Cbfβ levels accelerates MLL-AF9–mediated AML in bone marrow transplantation assays. These data reveal a newly defined negative regulation of RUNX1/CBFβ by MLL fusion proteins and suggest that targeting RUNX1/CBFβ levels may be a potential therapy for MLLs.",

Our experiments reveal apoptogenic capabilities equivalent to those documented for H1.2 in H1.1 and H1.3 isoforms. Deletion mutants of H1.2 and site-directed mutagenesis of H1.1 and H1.2 implicated the C-terminal domain in apoptogenic activity. In this context, disruption of protein kinase-C activity using chemical inhibitors, dominant-negative approaches and RNA interference coupled with site-directed modifications in H1.1, identified the protein kinase-Cβ1 isoform as a repressor of H1.1/H1.3 apoptogenic activity. Finally, a H1.2 C-terminal tail recombinant attenuated Bcl-xl inhibition of Bak-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the C-terminal domain was necessary and sufficient for apoptogenic functions. Thus, integration with apoptotic intermediates (via C-terminal tail interactions) may constitute a more generalized function of LH isoforms in apoptotic cascades.",apoptosis;Bak;H1.2-CTD;linker histone;PKC

E-mail: ude.tlibrednav@etnew.nasus","Directional export of messenger RNA (mRNA) protein particles (mRNPs) through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) requires multiple factors. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the NPC proteins Nup159 and Nup42 are asymmetrically localized to the cytoplasmic face and have distinct functional domains: a phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat domain that docks mRNP transport receptors and domains that bind the DEAD-box ATPase Dbp5 and its activating cofactor Gle1, respectively. We speculated that the Nup42 and Nup159 FG domains play a role in positioning mRNPs for the terminal mRNP-remodeling steps carried out by Dbp5. Here we find that deletion (Δ) of both the Nup42 and Nup159 FG domains results in a cold-sensitive poly(A)+ mRNA export defect. The nup42ΔFG nup159ΔFG mutant also has synthetic lethal genetic interactions with dbp5 and gle1 mutants. RNA cross-linking experiments further indicate that the nup42ΔFG nup159ΔFG mutant has a reduced capacity for mRNP remodeling during export. To further analyze the role of these FG domains, we replaced the Nup159 or Nup42 FG domains with FG domains from other Nups. These FG “swaps” demonstrate that only certain FG domains are functional at the NPC cytoplasmic face. Strikingly, fusing the Nup42 FG domain to the carboxy-terminus of Gle1 bypasses the need for the endogenous Nup42 FG domain, highlighting the importance of proximal positioning for these factors. We conclude that the Nup42 and Nup159 FG domains target the mRNP to Gle1 and Dbp5 for mRNP remodeling at the NPC. Moreover, these results provide key evidence that character and context play a direct role in FG domain function and mRNA export.",nuclear pore complex;nuclear transport;DEAD-box protein;nucleoporin;mRNA export

The current understanding of the mechanisms by which MDM2 posttranslational modifications and protein binding cause p53 stabilization remains incomplete. Here we present evidence that the MDM2 central acidic region is critical for activating RING domain E3 ligase activity. A 30-amino-acid minimal region of the acidic domain binds to the RING domain through intramolecular interactions and stimulates the catalytic function of the RING domain in promoting ubiquitin release from charged E2. The minimal activation sequence is also the binding site for the ARF tumor suppressor, which inhibits ubiquitination of p53. The acidic domain-RING domain intramolecular interaction is modulated by ATM-mediated phosphorylation near the RING domain or by binding of ARF. These results suggest that MDM2 phosphorylation and association with protein regulators share a mechanism in inhibiting the E3 ligase function and stabilizing p53 and suggest that targeting the MDM2 autoactivation mechanism may be useful for therapeutic modulation of p53 levels.",

Accuracy of chromosome segregation depends critically upon Aurora B phosphorylation of Ndc80/Hec1. To determine how CCAN protein architecture mechanically constrains intrakinetochore stretch between CENP-A and Ndc80/Hec1 for proper Ndc80/Hec1 phosphorylation, we used super-resolution fluorescence microscopy and selective protein depletion. We found that at bi-oriented chromosomes in late prometaphase cells, CENP-T is stretched ~16 nm to the inner end of Ndc80/Hec1, much less than expected for full-length CENP-T. Depletion of various CCAN linker proteins induced hyper-intrakinetochore stretch (an additional 20-60 nm) with corresponding significant decreases in Aurora B phosphorylation of Ndc80/Hec1. Thus, proper intrakinetochore stretch is required for normal kinetochore function and depends critically on all the CCAN mechanical linkers to the Ndc80 complex.",

We will define a cellular signaling microdomain and apply this definition to the plethora of means by which cellular communication has been hypothesized to occur in the blood vessel wall. To that end, we make a case for three broad areas of cellular communication where signaling microdomains could play an important role: 1) paracrine release of free radicals and gaseous molecules such as nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species; 2) role of ion channels including gap junctions and potassium channels, especially those associated with the endothelium-derived hyperpolarization mediated signaling, and lastly, 3) mechanism of exocytosis that has considerable oversight by signaling microdomains, especially those associated with the release of von Willebrand factor.

Advanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments indicate that these conformational changes can occur in the absence of ligand molecules (or with bound ligands), and that the ligands may “select” protein conformations for binding (or unbinding). In this review, we argue that this conformational selection requires transition times for ligand binding and unbinding that are small compared to the dwell times of proteins in different conformations, which is plausible for small ligand molecules. Such a separation of timescales leads to a decoupling and temporal ordering of binding/unbinding events and conformational changes. We propose that conformational-selection and induced-change processes (such as induced fit) are two sides of the same coin, because the temporal ordering is reversed in binding and unbinding direction. Conformational-selection processes can be characterized by a conformational excitation that occurs prior to a binding or unbinding event, while induced-change processes exhibit a characteristic conformational relaxation that occurs after a binding or unbinding event. We discuss how the ordering of events can be determined from relaxation rates and effective on- and off-rates determined in mixing experiments, and from the conformational exchange rates measured in advanced NMR or single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments. For larger ligand molecules such as peptides, conformational changes and binding events can be intricately coupled and exhibit aspects of conformational-selection and induced-change processes in both binding and unbinding direction.",binding kinetics;conformational selection;induced fit;advanced nuclear magnetic resonance experiments;single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer

Yet, the reliability of these two techniques is greatly affected by the omnipresent water vapor in the atmosphere. Several criteria are currently in use as quality controls to ensure the protein absorption spectrum is negligibly affected by water vapor interference. In this study, through a second derivative study of liquid water, we first argue that the previously established criteria cannot guarantee a reliable evaluation of water vapor interference due to a phenomenon that we refer to as sample’s absorbance-dependent water vapor interference. Then, through a comparative study of protein and liquid water, we show that a protein absorption spectrum can still be significantly affected by water vapor interference even though it satisfies the established criteria.

We report here that Blm10 is required for the maintenance of functional mitochondria. BLM10 expression is induced 25-fold upon a switch from fermentation to oxidative metabolism. In the absence of BLM10, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells exhibit a temperature-sensitive growth defect under oxidative growth conditions and produce colonies with dysfunctional mitochondria at high frequency. Loss of BLM10 leads to reduced respiratory capacity, increased mitochondrial oxidative damage, and reduced viability in the presence of oxidative stress or death stimuli. In the absence of BLM10, increased fragmentation of the mitochondrial network under oxidative stress is observed indicative of elevated activity of the mitochondrial fission machinery. The degradation of Dnm1, the main factor mediating mitochondrial fission, is impaired in the absence of BLM10 in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that the mitochondrial functional and morphological changes observed are related to elevated Dnm1 levels. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that cells that constitutively overexpress DNM1 display the same mitochondrial defects as blm10Δ cells. The data are consistent with a model in which Blm10 proteasome-mediated turnover of Dnm1 is required for the maintenance of mitochondrial function and provides cytoprotection under conditions that induce increased mitochondrial damage and programmed cell death.",Mitochondria;Oxidative Stress;Proteasome;Protein Degradation;Respiration

To achieve this, most colicins require an abundant porin (e.g. OmpF) plus a low‐copy‐number, high‐affinity, outer membrane protein receptor (e.g. BtuB). Recently, genetic screens have suggested that colicin N (ColN), which has no high‐affinity receptor, targets highly abundant lipopolysaccharide (LPS) instead. Here we reveal the details of this interaction and demonstrate that the ColN receptor‐binding domain (ColN‐R) binds to a specific region of LPS close to the membrane surface. Data from in vitro studies using calorimetry and both liquid‐ and solid‐state NMR reveal the interactions behind the in vivo requirement for a defined oligosaccharide region of LPS. Delipidated LPS (LPSΔLIPID) shows weaker binding; and thus full affinity requires the lipid component. The site of LPS binding means that ColN will preferably bind at the interface and thus position itself close to the surface of its translocon component, OmpF. ColN is, currently, unique among colicins in requiring LPS and, combined with previous data, this implies that the ColN translocon is distinct from those of other known colicins.",

Environmental and occupational exposure to high concentrations of Mn causes manganism, a well-defined movement disorder in humans, with symptoms resembling Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, manganism is distinct from PD and the neural basis of its pathology is poorly understood. To address this issue, we generated a zebrafish model of manganism by incubating larvae in rearing medium containing Mn. We find that Mn-treated zebrafish larvae exhibit specific postural and locomotor defects. Larvae begin to float on their sides, show a curved spine and swim in circles. We discovered that treatment with Mn causes postural defects by interfering with mechanotransduction at the neuromasts. Furthermore, we find that the circling locomotion could be caused by long-duration bursting in the motor neurons, which can lead to long-duration tail bends in the Mn-treated larvae. Mn-treated larvae also exhibited fewer startle movements. Additionally, we show that the intensity of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity is reversibly reduced after Mn-treatment. This led us to propose that reduced dopamine neuromodulation drives the changes in startle movements. To test this, when we supplied an external source of dopamine to Mn-treated larvae, the larvae exhibited a normal number of startle swims. Taken together, these results indicate that Mn interferes with neuronal function at the sensory, motor and modulatory levels, and open avenues for therapeutically targeted studies on the zebrafish model of manganism.",Zebrafish;Manganism;Mechanotransduction;Fictive motor patterns;Dopaminergic neurons

The monomeric precursor of elastin, tropoelastin, as well as polypeptides containing smaller subsets of the tropoelastin sequence, can self-assemble through a colloidal phase separation process called coacervation. Present understanding suggests that self-assembly is promoted by association of hydrophobic domains contained within the tropoelastin sequence, whereas polymerization is achieved by covalent joining of lysine side chains within distinct alanine-rich, α-helical cross-linking domains. In this study, model elastin polypeptides were used to determine the structure of cross-linking domains during the assembly process and the effect of sequence alterations in these domains on assembly and structure. CD temperature melts indicated that partial α-helical structure in cross-linking domains at lower temperatures was absent at physiological temperature. Solid-state NMR demonstrated that β-strand structure of the cross-linking domains dominated in the coacervate state, although α-helix was predominant after subsequent cross-linking of lysine side chains with genipin. Mutation of lysine residues to hydrophobic amino acids, tyrosine or alanine, leads to increased propensity for β-structure and the formation of amyloid-like fibrils, characterized by thioflavin-T binding and transmission electron microscopy. These findings indicate that cross-linking domains are structurally labile during assembly, adapting to changes in their environment and aggregated state. Furthermore, the sequence of cross-linking domains has a dramatic effect on self-assembly properties of elastin-like polypeptides, and the presence of lysine residues in these domains may serve to prevent inappropriate ordered aggregation.",Amyloid;Elastin;Extracellular Matrix;Protein Self-assembly;Protein Structure;Cross-linking Domain

While loss of N-terminal acetylation is associated with many abnormalities, the molecular basis of these effects is known for only a few cases, where acetylation of single factors has been linked to binding avidity or metabolic stability. In contrast, the impact of N-terminal acetylation for the majority of the proteome, and its combinatorial contributions to phenotypes, are unknown. Here, by studying the yeast prion [PSI+], an amyloid of the Sup35 protein, we show that loss of N-terminal acetylation promotes general protein misfolding, a redeployment of chaperones to these substrates, and a corresponding stress response. These proteostasis changes, combined with the decreased stability of unacetylated Sup35 amyloid, reduce the size of prion aggregates and reverse their phenotypic consequences. Thus, loss of N-terminal acetylation, and its previously unanticipated role in protein biogenesis, globally resculpts the proteome to create a unique phenotype.",

We previously demonstrated that GroEL-GroES enhances the productive folding of a kinetically trapped substrate protein through unfolding, where both binding energy and the energy of ATP hydrolysis are used to disrupt the inhibitory misfolded states. Here, we show that the intrinsically disordered yet highly conserved C-terminal sequence of the GroEL subunits directly contributes to substrate protein unfolding. Interactions between the C terminus and the non-native substrate protein alter the binding position of the substrate protein on the GroEL apical surface. The C-terminal tails also impact the conformational state of the substrate protein during capture and encapsulation on the GroEL ring. Importantly, removal of the C termini results in slower overall folding, reducing the fraction of the substrate protein that commits quickly to a productive folding pathway and slowing several kinetically distinct folding transitions that occur inside the GroEL-GroES cavity. The conserved C-terminal tails of GroEL are thus important for protein folding from the beginning to the end of the chaperonin reaction cycle.",Chaperone;Molecular Chaperone;Protein Dynamic;Protein Folding;Protein Misfolding;GroEL;Hsp60;Chaperonin

rapidly evaluating potential small-molecule–target
interactions from mixtures in a single solution that is compatible
with unpurified targets in biological samples. The ability to identify
ligand+target pairs from complex samples including cell lysates
offers significant advantages compared to other methods for evaluating
DNA-encoded chemical libraries. Samples in cell lysates are able to
undergo native post-translational modification and interact with accessory
proteins and metabolites in ways that better reflect their relevant
biological environment. Because IDUP is compatible with crude cell
lysates, difficult-to-purify, poorly soluble, intrinsically unstable,
and aggregation-prone targets may also be compatible with this method,
without requiring truncation or other strategies used to promote heterologous
expression. We demonstrated the ability of IDUP to selectively amplify
DNA sequences corresponding to interactions between His6-tagged or SNAP-tagged target proteins and their ligands in cell
lysates, and we have demonstrated that IDUP results reflect the ability
of accessory proteins to modulate ligand–target affinity. We
also demonstrated the ability of IDUP to selectively enrich DNA sequences
corresponding to known protein+ligand interactions with affinities
from 0.2 nM to 26 μM from a library of SNAP-target-expressing
cell lysates and a library of DNA-linked small molecules. Moreover,
we observed a relationship between sequence counts and ligand–target
identity, suggesting that IDUP sequencing results may be able to not
only identify new interactions but also estimate their affinities.

strategy to evaluate DNA-encoded libraries under conditions in which
purified protein targets are unavailable or differ in important ways

Most preproteins contain a cleavable sequence at their N terminal (transit peptide) serving as a signal for targeting to the organelle and recognition by the translocation machinery TOC–TIC (translocon of outer membrane complex–translocon of inner membrane complex) spanning the dual membrane envelope. The plastid proteome needs constant remodeling in response to developmental and environmental factors. Therefore selective regulation of preprotein import plays a crucial role in plant development. In this review we describe the diversity of transit peptides and TOC receptor complexes, and summarize the current knowledge and potential directions for future research concerning regulation of the different Toc isoforms.",plastids;protein import;TOC complex;preproteins;post-translational modifications

PrPC N-terminal moiety is intrinsically disordered and is able to interact with a variety of ligands. Physiological ligands have neurotrophic activity, whilst others, including protein toxic oligomers, have neurotoxic functions. These two opposite activities involve different interacting partners and result from different PrPC-activated signaling pathways. Remarkably, PrPC may be inactivated either by physiological endoproteolysis and release of the N-terminal domain, or by ectodomain shedding. Ligand-induced PrPC dimerization or enforced dimerization of PrPC indicate that PrPC dimerization represents an important molecular switch for both intracellular signaling and inactivation by the release of PrPC N-terminal domain or shedding. In this review, we summarize evidence that cell surface receptor activity of PrPC is finely regulated by dimerization.",prion protein trafficking;dimerization;signaling;neuroprotection;neurodegeneration

Subversion of the cellular machinery that controls replication of the infected host cell is a common activity of many viruses. Viruses employ different strategies to deregulate cell cycle checkpoint controls and modulate cell proliferation pathways. A number of DNA and RNA viruses encode proteins that target critical cell cycle regulators to achieve cellular conditions that are beneficial for viral replication. Many DNA viruses induce quiescent cells to enter the cell cycle; this is thought to increase pools of deoxynucleotides and thus, facilitate viral replication. In contrast, some viruses can arrest cells in a particular phase of the cell cycle that is favorable for replication of the specific virus. Cell cycle arrest may inhibit early cell death of infected cells, allow the cells to evade immune defenses, or help promote virus assembly. Although beneficial for the viral life cycle, virus-mediated alterations in normal cell cycle control mechanisms could have detrimental effects on cellular physiology and may ultimately contribute to pathologies associated with the viral infection, including cell transformation and cancer progression and maintenance. In this chapter, we summarize various strategies employed by DNA and RNA viruses to modulate the replication cycle of the virus-infected cell. When known, we describe how these virus-associated effects influence replication of the virus and contribute to diseases associated with infection by that specific virus.",Cell cycle;Regulation;DNA and RNA viruses;Consequences

SelS has a single-spanning transmembrane domain and protects cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis through interaction with p97(VCP). The cytosolic tail of SelS consists of a coiled-coil domain, a putative VCP-interacting motif (VIM), and an unpronounced glycine- and proline-rich secondary structure. To understand the regulatory mechanism of SelS during ER stress, we investigated the interaction of the protein with p97(VCP) using mouse neuroblastoma cells and human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The SelS expression level increased when ER stress was induced. In addition, the effect of ER stress was enhanced, and recruitment of p97(VCP) to the ER membrane was inhibited in SelS knockdown cells. The effect of SelS knockdown was rescued by ectopic expression of SelS U188C. p97(VCP) interacted with SelS U188C and was recruited to the ER membrane. The expression of SelS[ΔVIM], which is a VIM deletion mutant of SelS, also showed both a recovery effect and an interaction with p97(VCP) in cells. However, mutants in which the proline residue positions 178 or 183 of SelS were changed to alanine or were deleted did not interact with p97(VCP). The proline mutants did not rescue ER stress in SelS knockdown cells. These results suggest that both Pro178 and Pro183 of SelS play important roles in the translocation of p97(VCP) to the ER membrane and protect cells from ER stress.",ER Stress;ER-associated Degradation;Protein-Protein Interactions;Selenium;Selenoprotein;p97(VCP)

There is growing appreciation that G proteins are also present at endomembrane compartments, where they can potentially interact with a distinct set of signaling proteins. Here, we examine the cellular trafficking function of the G protein α subunit in yeast, Gpa1. Gpa1 contains a unique 109-amino acid insert within the α-helical domain that undergoes a variety of posttranslational modifications. Among these is monoubiquitination, catalyzed by the NEDD4 family ubiquitin ligase Rsp5. Using a newly optimized method for G protein purification together with biophysical measures of structure and function, we show that the ubiquitination domain does not influence enzyme activity. By screening a panel of 39 gene deletion mutants, each lacking a different ubiquitin binding domain protein, we identify seven that are necessary to deliver Gpa1 to the vacuole compartment including four proteins (Ede1, Bul1, Ddi1, and Rup1) previously not known to be involved in this process. Finally, we show that proper endocytosis of the G protein is needed for sustained cellular morphogenesis and mating in response to pheromone stimulation. We conclude that a cascade of ubiquitin-binding proteins serves to deliver the G protein to its final destination within the cell. In this instance and in contrast to the previously characterized visual system, endocytosis from the plasma membrane is needed for proper signal transduction rather than for signal desensitization.",Endocytosis;G Proteins;Protein Domains;Protein Purification;Ubiquitination

It has been shown that oxidation of either M109 or M124 in CaM diminishes CaM regulation of the muscle calcium release channel, the ryanodine receptor (RyR), and that mutation of M to Q (glutamine) in either case produces functional effects identical to those of oxidation. Here we have used site-directed spin labeling and double electron-electron resonance (DEER), a pulsed EPR technique that measures distances between spin labels, to characterize the structural changes resulting from these mutations. Spin labels were attached to a pair of introduced cysteine residues, one in the C-lobe (T117C) and one in the N-lobe (T34C) of CaM, and DEER was used to determine the distribution of interspin distances. Ca binding induced a large increase in the mean distance, in concert with previous x-ray crystallography and NMR data, showing a closed structure in the absence of Ca and an open structure in the presence of Ca. DEER revealed additional information about CaM’s structural heterogeneity in solution: In both the presence and absence of Ca, CaM populates both structural states, one with probes separated by ~4 nm (closed) and another at ~6 nm (open). Ca shifts the structural equilibrium constant toward the open state by a factor of 13. DEER reveals the distribution of interprobe distances, showing that each of these states is itself partially disordered, with the width of each population ranging from 1.5 to 3 nm. Both mutations (M109Q and M124Q) decrease the effect of Ca on the structure of CaM, primarily by decreasing the closed-to-open equilibrium constant in the presence of Ca. We propose that Met oxidation alters CaM’s functional interaction with its target proteins by perturbing this Ca-dependent structural shift.",

Circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectroscopies were used to examine the effects of pH (1.0–3.0 and 7.5–10.5) and temperature (20 and 37 °C) on the structural integrity of ALAS. The secondary structure, as deduced from far-UV CD, is mostly resilient to pH and temperature changes. Partial unfolding was observed at pH 2.0, but further decreasing pH resulted in acid-induced refolding of the secondary structure to nearly native levels. The tertiary structure rigidity, monitored by near-UV CD, is lost under acidic and specific alkaline conditions (pH 10.5 and pH 9.5/37 °C), where ALAS populates a molten globule state. As the enzyme becomes less structured with increased alkalinity, the chiral environment of the internal aldimine is also modified, with a shift from a 420 nm to 330 nm dichroic band. Under acidic conditions, the PLP cofactor dissociates from ALAS. Reaction with 8-anilino-1-naphtalenesulfonic acid corroborates increased exposure of hydrophobic clusters in the alkaline and acidic molten globules, although the reaction is more pronounced with the latter. Furthermore, quenching the intrinsic fluorescence of ALAS with acrylamide at pH 1.0 and 9.5 yielded subtly different dynamic quenching constants. The alkaline molten globule state of ALAS is catalytically active (pH 9.5/37 °C), although the kcat value is significantly decreased. Finally, the binding of 5-aminolevulinate restricts conformational fluctuations in the alkaline molten globule. Overall, our findings prove how the structural plasticity of ALAS contributes to reaching a functional enzyme.",aminolevulinate synthase;pyridoxal-5′phosphate;heme;molten globule;protein folding;intrinsically disordered proteins

RAD54, a member of the ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling factor family, is required to promote the RAD51-mediated homologous pairing in nucleosomal DNA. In higher eukaryotes, most nucleosomes form higher-ordered chromatin containing the linker histone H1. However, the mechanism by which RAD51/RAD54-mediated homologous pairing occurs in higher-ordered chromatin has not been elucidated. In this study, we found that a histone chaperone, Nap1, accumulates on DSB sites in human cells, and DSB repair is substantially decreased in Nap1-knockdown cells. We determined that Nap1 binds to RAD54, enhances the RAD54-mediated nucleosome remodeling by evicting histone H1, and eventually stimulates the RAD51-mediated homologous pairing in higher-ordered chromatin containing histone H1.",

The P protein interacts with the L protein and the N-RNA template, thus connecting the polymerase to the template. P protein also binds to free N protein to maintain it in a soluble, encapsidation-competent form. Previously, five sites of phosphorylation were identified on the P protein and these sites were reported to be differentially important for mRNA synthesis or genomic replication. The previous studies were carried out by biochemical analysis of portions of the authentic viral P protein or by analysis of bacterium-expressed, exogenously phosphorylated P protein by mutagenesis. However, there has been no systematic biochemical search for phosphorylation sites on authentic, virus-expressed P protein. In this study, we analyzed the P protein isolated from VSV-infected cells for sites of phosphorylation by mass spectrometry. We report the identification of Tyr14 as a previously unidentified phosphorylation site of VSV P and show that it is essential for viral transcription and replication.

ZipA interacts with FtsZ with high affinity and interacts with the CCTP with low affinity, but the reason for this difference is not clear. In this study we show that this difference is due to the oligomerization of FtsZ converting the CCTP to a multivalent ligand that binds multiple ZipAs bound to a surface with high avidity. Artificial dimerization of the CCTP is sufficient to increase the affinity for ZipA in vitro. Similar principles apply to the interaction of FtsZ with SlmA.

Nucleation-promoting factors (NPFs) of the WASp-family generate F-actin in the cytosol via the VCA-domain and support RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription in the nucleus. Whether nuclear-WASp requires the integration of its ARP2/3-dependent cytoplasmic function to reprogram gene transcription, however, remains unresolved. Using the model of human T helper (TH) cell differentiation, we find that WASp has a functional nuclear localizing (NLS) and nuclear exit (NES) sequences and accordingly its effects on transcription are controlled mainly at the level of its nuclear entry and exit via the nuclear pore. Human WASp does not utilize its VCA-dependent, ARP2/3-driven, cytoplasmic effector mechanisms to support histone H3K4 methyltransferase activity in the nucleus of TH1-skewed cells. Accordingly, an isolated deficiency of nuclear-WASp is sufficient to impair the transcriptional reprogramming of TBX21 and IFNG promoters in TH1-skewed cells, whereas, an isolated deficiency of cytosolic-WASp does not impair this process. In contrast, nuclear presence of WASp in TH2-skewed cells is small and its loss does not impair transcriptional reprogramming of GATA3 and IL4 promoters. Our study unveils an ARP2/3:VCA-independent function of nuclear-WASp in TH1-gene activation that is uncoupled from its cytoplasmic role in actin polymerization.",

It is a potential drug target in the treatment of cancer. In this study, we screen the TCM compounds in TCM Database@Taiwan to investigate the potent lead compounds as PP2A agent. The results of docking simulation are optimized under dynamic conditions by MD simulations after virtual screening to validate the stability of H-bonds between PP2A-α protein and each ligand. The top TCM candidates, trichosanatine and squamosamide, have potential binding affinities and interactions with key residues Arg89 and Arg214 in the docking simulation. In addition, these interactions were stable under dynamic conditions. Hence, we propose the TCM compounds, trichosanatine and squamosamide, as potential candidates as lead compounds for further study in drug development process with the PP2A-α protein.",

Vast data volumes have been accumulated in cell-free expression databases, covering a whole range of existing proteins. It makes possible comprehensive bioinformatics analysis and identification of multiple features associated with protein solubility and aggregation. In the present paper, an approach to identify the multiple physicochemical and structural properties of amino acid sequences associated with soluble expression of eukaryotic proteins in cell-free bacterial extracts is presented. The method includes: (1) categorical assessment of expression data; (2) calculation and prediction of multiple properties of expressed sequences; (3) correlation of the individual properties with the expression scores; and (4) evaluation of statistical significance of the observed correlations. Using this method, a number of significant correlations between calculated and predicted properties of amino acid sequences and their propensity for soluble cell-free expression have been revealed.",cell-free protein synthesis;protein solubility;physicochemical and structural protein properties;categorical data analysis;correlation analysis

This model qualitatively reproduces the known phase transitions between disordered, ordered, and gel membrane phases, and the phase transitions are accompanied by significant changes in the nature of the lipid dynamics. In particular, lipid diffusion in the liquid-ordered phase is hindered by the transient trapping of molecules by their neighbors, similar to the dynamics of a liquid approaching its glass transition. This transient molecular caging gives rise to two distinct mobility groups within a single-component membrane: lipids that are transiently trapped, and lipids with displacements on the scale of the intermolecular spacing. Most significantly, lipids within these distinct mobility states spatially segregate, creating transient “islands” of enhanced mobility having a size and time scale compatible with lipid “rafts,” dynamical structures thought to be important for cell membrane function. Although the dynamic lipid clusters that we observe do not themselves correspond to rafts (which are more complex, multicomponent structures), we hypothesize that such rafts may develop from the same universal mechanism, explaining why raft-like regions should arise, regardless of lipid structural or compositional details. These clusters are strikingly similar to the dynamical clusters found in glass-forming fluids, and distinct from phase-separation clusters. Further examination shows that mobile lipid clusters can be dissected into smaller clusters of cooperatively rearranging molecules. The geometry of these clusters can be understood in the context of branched equilibrium polymers, related to the statistics percolation theory. We discuss how these dynamical structures relate to a range observations on the dynamics of lipid membranes.",

To date, no coherent mechanism has been proposed that would explain defensins’ enigmatic efficiency towards various toxins. We showed that binding of neutrophil α-defensin HNP1 to affected bacterial toxins caused their local unfolding, potentiated their thermal melting and precipitation, exposed new regions for proteolysis, and increased susceptibility to collisional quenchers, without causing similar affects on tested mammalian structural and enzymatic proteins. Enteric α-defensin HD5 and β-defensin hBD2 shared similar toxin-unfolding effects with HNP1, albeit to different degrees.

Direct phosphoinositide control of the activity of ion channels and transporters has been the most convincing case of the critical importance of phospholipid-protein interactions in the functional control of membrane proteins. Furthermore, second messengers, such as [Ca2+]i, or posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can directly or allosterically fine-tune phospholipid-protein interactions and modulate activity.

Recently, we have shown that the human La protein stimulates IRES-mediated translation of the cooperative oncogene CCND1 in cervical cancer cells. However, there is little known about the underlying molecular mechanism by which La stimulates CCND1 IRES-mediated translation, and we propose that its RNA chaperone activity is required. Herein, we show that La binds close to the CCND1 start codon and demonstrate that La's RNA chaperone activity can change the folding of its binding site. We map the RNA chaperone domain (RCD) within the C-terminal region of La in close proximity to a novel AKT phosphorylation site (T389). Phosphorylation at T389 by AKT-1 strongly impairs its RNA chaperone activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the RCD as well as T389 is required to stimulate CCND1 IRES-mediated translation in cells. In summary, we provide a model whereby a novel interplay between RNA-binding, RNA chaperoning and AKT phosphorylation of La protein regulates CCND1 IRES-mediated translation.",

In our present study, we identified nine putative phosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry and demonstrated that threonine residue 279 (T279) is functionally significant. Minigenome expression assays revealed that a mutation at the T279 site caused a loss of activity. Limited proteolysis and electron microscopy suggested that a T279A mutant lacked the ability to encapsidate viral RNA but was not denatured. Furthermore, dephosphorylation of the T279 site by alkaline phosphatase treatment caused deficiencies in nucleocapsid formation. Taken together, these results indicate that phosphorylation at T279 is a prerequisite for successful nucleocapsid formation.",

In a model of metabolic syndrome, SirT1 activation attenuated apoptosis of hepatocytes and improved liver function including lipid metabolism. We show in SirT1-overexpressing HepG2 cells that oxidants (nitrosocysteine and hydrogen peroxide) or metabolic stress (high palmitate and high glucose) inactivated SirT1 by reversible oxidative post-translational modifications (OPTMs) on three cysteines. Mutating these oxidation-sensitive cysteines to serine preserved SirT1 activity and abolished reversible OPTMs. Overexpressed mutant SirT1 maintained deacetylase activity and attenuated proapoptotic signaling, whereas overexpressed wild type SirT1 was less protective in metabolically or oxidant-stressed cells. To prove that OPTMs of SirT1 are glutathione (GSH) adducts, glutaredoxin-1 was overexpressed to remove this modification. Glutaredoxin-1 overexpression maintained endogenous SirT1 activity and prevented proapoptotic signaling in metabolically stressed HepG2 cells. The in vivo significance of oxidative inactivation of SirT1 was investigated in livers of high fat diet-fed C57/B6J mice. SirT1 deacetylase activity was decreased in the absence of changes in SirT1 expression and associated with a marked increase in OPTMs. These results indicate that glutathione adducts on specific SirT1 thiols may be responsible for dysfunctional SirT1 associated with liver disease in metabolic syndrome.",Glutathionylation;Metabolic Diseases;Oxidative Stress;Polyphenols;Resveratrol;Glutathiolation;High Fat High Sucrose Diet;Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species

Here we show that PIP2 is an important cofactor for activation of small conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channels (SK) by Ca2+-bound calmodulin (CaM). Removal of the endogenous PIP2 inhibits SK channels. The PIP2-binding site resides at the interface of CaM and the SK C-terminus. We further demonstrate that the affinity of PIP2 for its target proteins can be regulated by cellular signaling. Phosphorylation of CaM T79, located adjacent to the PIP2-binding site, by Casein Kinase 2 reduces the affinity of PIP2 for the CaM-SK channel complex by altering the dynamic interactions among amino acid residues surrounding the PIP2-binding site. This effect of CaM phosphorylation promotes greater channel inhibition by G-protein-mediated hydrolysis of PIP2.",

Yet, PHC3 SAM polymerizes utilizing just five SAMs per turn of the helical polymer rather than the typical six per turn observed for all SAM polymers reported to date. Structural analysis suggested that malleability of the PHC3 SAM would allow formation of not just the five-fold repeat structure but possibly others.

Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) embedded in the NE serve as a dominant gateway for nuclear export of mRNA. However, the fundamental characterization of export dynamics of mRNPs through the NPC has been hindered by several technical limits. First, the size of NPC that is barely below the diffraction limit of conventional light microscopy requires a super-resolution microscopy imaging approach. Next, the fast transit of mRNPs through the NPC further demands a high temporal resolution by the imaging approach. Finally, the inherent three-dimensional (3D) movements of mRNPs through the NPC demand the method to provide a 3D mapping of both transport kinetics and transport pathways of mRNPs.

Mutations in and alterations in expression levels of alpha-synuclein cause autosomal dominant early onset heredity forms of Parkinson's disease, and sporadic Parkinson's disease is defined in part by the presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites that are composed primarily of alpha-synuclein deposited in an aggregated amyloid fibril state. The normal function of alpha-synuclein is poorly understood, and the precise mechanisms by which it leads to toxicity and cell death are also unclear. Although alpha-synuclein is a highly soluble, cytoplasmic protein, it binds to a variety of cellular membranes of different properties and compositions. These interactions are considered critical for at least some normal functions of alpha-synuclein, and may well play critical roles in both the aggregation of the protein and its mechanisms of toxicity. Here we review the known features of alpha-synuclein membrane interactions in the context of both the putative functions of the protein and of its pathological roles in disease.",alpha-synuclein;Parkinson;amyloid;aggregation;neurotransmission;synucleinopathy

We propose that atomistic molecular dynamics simulations provide a diverse sampling of biologically relevant structures for these missing segments (and beyond) to improve structural modeling and structure prediction. Here we make use of the Dynameomics data warehouse, which contains simulations of representatives of essentially all known protein folds. We developed novel computational methods to efficiently identify, rank and retrieve small peptide structures, or fragments, from this database. We also created a novel data model to analyze and compare large repositories of structural data, such as contained within the Protein Data Bank and the Dynameomics data warehouse. Our evaluation compares these structural repositories for improving loop predictions and analyzes the utility of our methods and models. Using a standard set of loop structures, containing 510 loops, 30 for each loop length from 4 to 20 residues, we find that the inclusion of Dynameomics structures in fragment-based methods improves the quality of the loop predictions without being dependent on sequence homology. Depending on loop length, ∼25–75% of the best predictions came from the Dynameomics set, resulting in lower main chain root-mean-square deviations for all fragment lengths using the combined fragment library. We also provide specific cases where Dynameomics fragments provide better predictions for NMR loop structures than fragments from crystal structures.

It has also been found to play a critical role in the immune imbalance that accompanies disease progression, a characteristic that has prompted the search for an effective αSyn-based immunotherapy. In this study, we have simultaneously exploited two important features of certain heat-shock proteins (HSPs): their classical “chaperone” activities and their recently discovered and diverse “immunoactive” properties. In particular, we have explored the immune response elicited by immunization of C57BL/6 mice with an αSyn/Hsp70 protein combination in the absence of added adjuvant. Our results show differential effects for mice immunized with the αSyn/Hsp70 complex, including a restrained αSyn-specific (IgM and IgG) humoral response as well as minimized alterations in the Treg (CD4+CD25+Foxp3+) and Teff (CD4+Foxp3−) cell populations, as opposed to significant changes in mice immunized with αSyn and Hsp70 alone. Furthermore, in vitro-stimulated splenocytes from immunized mice showed the lowest relative response against αSyn challenge for the “αSyn/Hsp70” experimental group as measured by IFN-γ and IL-17 secretion, and higher IL-10 levels when stimulated with LPS. Finally, serum levels of Th1-cytokine IFN-γ and immunomodulatory IL-10 indicated a unique shift toward an immunomodulatory/immunoprotective phenotype in mice immunized with the αSyn/Hsp70 complex. Overall, we propose the use of functional “HSP-chaperoned amyloid/aggregating proteins” generated with appropriate HSP-substrate protein combinations, such as the αSyn/Hsp70 complex, as a novel strategy for immune-based intervention against synucleinopathies and other amyloid or “misfolding” neurodegenerative disorders.",amyloid disease;heat-shock proteins (HSPs);immunization;immunomodulation;α-synuclein

Recent studies have suggested that mutant p53 can form aggregates that are related to loss-of-function effects, negative dominance and gain-of-function effects and cancers with a worsened prognosis. In recent years, several degenerative diseases have been shown to have prion-like properties similar to mammalian prion proteins (PrPs). However, whereas prion diseases are rare, the incidence of these neurodegenerative pathologies is high. Malignant tumors involving mutated forms of the tumor suppressor p53 protein seem to have similar substrata. The aggregation of the entire p53 protein and three functional domains of p53 into amyloid oligomers and fibrils has been demonstrated. Amyloid aggregates of mutant p53 have been detected in breast cancer and malignant skin tumors. Most p53 mutations related to cancer development are found in the DNA-binding domain (p53C), which has been experimentally shown to form amyloid oligomers and fibrils. Several computation programs have corroborated the predicted propensity of p53C to form aggregates, and some of these programs suggest that p53C is more likely to form aggregates than the globular domain of PrP. Overall, studies imply that mutant p53 exerts a dominant-negative regulatory effect on wild-type (WT) p53 and exerts gain-of-function effects when co-aggregating with other proteins such as p63, p73 and acetyltransferase p300. We review here the prion-like behavior of oncogenic p53 mutants that provides an explanation for their dominant-negative and gain-of-function properties and for the high metastatic potential of cancers bearing p53 mutations. The inhibition of the aggregation of p53 into oligomeric and fibrillar amyloids appears to be a promising target for therapeutic intervention in malignant tumor diseases.",p53;prionoid proteins;protein aggregation;cancer

Grain setting defect1 (GSD1), which encodes a putative remorin protein, was found to affect grain setting in rice. Investigation of the phenotype of a transfer DNA insertion mutant (gsd1-Dominant) with enhanced GSD1 expression revealed abnormalities including a reduced grain setting rate, accumulation of carbohydrates in leaves, and lower soluble sugar content in the phloem exudates. GSD1 was found to be specifically expressed in the plasma membrane and plasmodesmata (PD) of phloem companion cells. Experimental evidence suggests that the phenotype of the gsd1-Dominant mutant is caused by defects in the grain-filling process as a result of the impaired transport of carbohydrates from the photosynthetic site to the phloem. GSD1 functioned in affecting PD conductance by interacting with rice ACTIN1 in association with the PD callose binding protein1. Together, our results suggest that GSD1 may play a role in regulating photoassimilate translocation through the symplastic pathway to impact grain setting in rice.",

In humans, the CRMP family comprises five members. Here, crystal structures of human CRMP-4 in a truncated and a full-length version are presented. The latter was determined from two types of crystals, which were either twinned or partially disordered. The crystal disorder was coupled with translational NCS in ordered domains and manifested itself with a rather sophisticated modulation of intensities. The data were demodulated using either the two-lattice treatment of lattice-translocation effects or a novel method in which demodulation was achieved by independent scaling of several groups of intensities. This iterative protocol does not rely on any particular parameterization of the modulation coefficients, but uses the current refined structure as a reference. The best results in terms of R factors and map correlation coefficients were obtained using this new method. The determined structures of CRMP-4 are similar to those of other CRMPs. Structural comparison allowed the confirmation of known residues, as well as the identification of new residues, that are important for the homo- and hetero-oligomerization of these proteins, which are critical to nerve-cell development. The structures provide further insight into the effects of medically relevant mutations of the DPYSL-3 gene encoding CRMP-4 and the putative enzymatic activities of CRMPs.",CRMP-4;lattice-translocation disorder

Using an innovative mouse-human chimera model, it was shown that HCV replicates to significantly lower levels in cyclophilin A–deficient animals than in mice with cyclophilin A [9]. Several cyclophilin inhibitors that retain anti-HCV activity but do not have the immunosuppressive properties of cyclosporine and tacrolimus have also been studied. These compounds maintain their antiviral activity, and at least one has reached late Phase III trials for HCV [10]. Whether there is a role for cyclophilin inhibitors in future cures of HCV remains unclear. Multiple inhibitors that target viral enzymes and promote viral clearance in a high percentage of patients are being adopted [10]. Still, cyclophilin inhibitors may ultimately prove clinically useful for viral infections that resist new treatment regimes or useful when used in combination with existing therapies.",

The different groups utilize different dinuclear cofactors to perform a diverse set of reactions. Several groups use an oxygen-activating di-iron cluster, while others use di-manganese or heterodinuclear Mn/Fe cofactors. Given the similar primary ligand preferences of Mn and Fe as well as the similarities between the binding sites, the basis for metal specificity in these systems remains enigmatic. Recent data for the heterodinuclear cluster show that the protein scaffold per se is capable of discriminating between Mn and Fe and can assemble the Mn/Fe center in the absence of any potential assembly machineries or metal chaperones. Here we review the current understanding of the assembly of the heterodinuclear cofactor in the two different protein groups in which it has been identified, ribonucleotide reductase R2c proteins and R2-like ligand-binding oxidases. Interestingly, although the two groups form the same metal cluster they appear to employ partly different mechanisms to assemble it. In addition, it seems that both the thermodynamics of metal binding and the kinetics of oxygen activation play a role in achieving metal specificity.",Affinity;Chlamydia;Cofactor maturation;Metal selection;Specificity

The transition of an unstructured monomeric peptide into self-assembled and more structured aggregates is the crucial conversion from what appears to be a harmless polypeptide into a malignant form that causes synaptotoxicity and neuronal cell death. Despite efforts to identify the toxic form of Aβ, the development of effective treatments for AD is still limited by the highly transient and dynamic nature of interconverting forms of Aβ. The variability within the in vivo “pool” of different Aβ peptides is another complicating factor.

To protect their periplasmic proteome against rapid acid-mediated damage, bacteria contain the acid-activated periplasmic chaperones HdeA and HdeB. Activation of HdeA at pH 2 was shown to correlate with its acid-induced dissociation into partially unfolded monomers. In contrast, HdeB, which has high structural similarities to HdeA, shows negligible chaperone activity at pH 2 and only modest chaperone activity at pH 3. These results raised intriguing questions concerning the physiological role of HdeB in bacteria, its activation mechanism, and the structural requirements for its function as a molecular chaperone. In this study, we conducted structural and biochemical studies that revealed that HdeB indeed works as an effective molecular chaperone. However, in contrast to HdeA, whose chaperone function is optimal at pH 2, the chaperone function of HdeB is optimal at pH 4, at which HdeB is still fully dimeric and largely folded. NMR, analytical ultracentrifugation, and fluorescence studies suggest that the highly dynamic nature of HdeB at pH 4 alleviates the need for monomerization and partial unfolding. Once activated, HdeB binds various unfolding client proteins, prevents their aggregation, and supports their refolding upon subsequent neutralization. Overexpression of HdeA promotes bacterial survival at pH 2 and 3, whereas overexpression of HdeB positively affects bacterial growth at pH 4. These studies demonstrate how two structurally homologous proteins with seemingly identical in vivo functions have evolved to provide bacteria with the means for surviving a range of acidic protein-unfolding conditions.",Bacteria;Chaperone;Protein Aggregation;Protein Folding;Stress Response

To unambiguously resolve the principal binding mode between two interacting species against the dynamic cellular background, we analyzed in-cell spectral data of a target protein over the time course of over-expression of its interacting partner by using Single Value Decomposition, SVD.

Two calcium phosphate proteins, statherin (43 amino acids) and leucine rich amelogenin protein (LRAP; 59 amino acids), have been studied in depth and have different dynamic properties and 2D- and 3D-structural features. These differences make it difficult to extract design principles used in nature for building materials with properties such as high strength, unusual morphologies, or uncommon phases. Consequently, design principles needed for developing synthetic materials controlled by proteins are not clear. Many biomineralization proteins are much larger than statherin and LRAP, necessitating the study of larger biomineralization proteins. More recent studies of the significantly larger full-length amelogenin (180 residues) represent a significant step forward to ultimately investigate the full diversity of biomineralization proteins. Interactions of amino acids, a silaffin derived peptide, and the model LK peptide with silica are also being studied, along with qualitative studies of the organic matrices interacting with calcium carbonate. Dipolar recoupling techniques have formed the core of the quantitative studies, yet the need for isolated spin pairs makes this approach costly and time intensive. The use of multidimensional techniques to study biomineralization proteins is becoming more common, methodology which, despite its challenges with these difficult-to-study proteins, will continue to drive future advancements in this area.",Biomineralization;Immobilized proteins;Dipolar recoupling;Protein structure;Protein dynamics;Protein orientation;Multi-dimensional solid state NMR;Amelogenin;Statherin;Silaffin

Consequently, there is intense focus on the discovery of novel inhibitors, e.g. small molecules and antibodies, to inhibit the formation and block the toxicity of oligomers. In Parkinson disease, the protein α-synuclein (αSN) forms cytotoxic oligomers. The flavonoid epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) has previously been shown to redirect the aggregation of αSN monomers and remodel αSN amyloid fibrils into disordered oligomers. Here, we dissect EGCG's mechanism of action. EGCG inhibits the ability of preformed oligomers to permeabilize vesicles and induce cytotoxicity in a rat brain cell line. However, EGCG does not affect oligomer size distribution or secondary structure. Rather, EGCG immobilizes the C-terminal region and moderately reduces the degree of binding of oligomers to membranes. We interpret our data to mean that the oligomer acts by destabilizing the membrane rather than by direct pore formation. This suggests that reduction (but not complete abolition) of the membrane affinity of the oligomer is sufficient to prevent cytotoxicity.",α-Synuclein;Dynamic Light Scattering;Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC);Membrane;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR);X-ray Scattering;EGCG;Oligomer;Toxicity

Although it has long been known that miRNAs bind to mRNAs to trigger translational repression and degradation, there had been much debate regarding their precise mode of action. It is now believed that translational control is the primary event, only later followed by mRNA destabilisation.

Eukaryotes use a series of complementary pathways to efficiently recognize and dispose of these terminally misfolded proteins. In this process, collectively termed ER-associated degradation (ERAD), misfolded proteins are retrotranslocated to the cytosol, polyubiquitinated, and degraded by the proteasome. Although there has been great progress in identifying ERAD components, how these factors accurately identify substrates remains poorly understood. The targeting of misfolded glycoproteins in the ER lumen for ERAD requires the lectin Yos9, which recognizes the glycan species found on terminally misfolded proteins. In a role that remains poorly characterized, Yos9 also binds the protein component of ERAD substrates. Here, we identified a 45-kDa domain of Yos9, consisting of residues 22–421, that is proteolytically stable, highly structured, and able to fully support ERAD in vivo. In vitro binding studies show that Yos9(22–421) exhibits sequence-specific recognition of linear peptides from the ERAD substrate, carboxypeptidase Y G255R (CPY*), and binds a model unfolded peptide ΔEspP and protein Δ131Δ in solution. Binding of Yos9 to these substrates results in their cooperative aggregation. Although the physiological consequences of this substrate-induced aggregation remain to be seen, it has the potential to play a role in the regulation of ERAD.",Aggregation;Carbohydrate-binding Protein;Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER);Endoplasmic Reticulum-associated Protein Degradation (ERAD);Substrate Specificity;CPY*;Yos9

In this study, we explored the impact of this novel mutation on the aggregation, cellular and biophysical properties of α-Syn, in an attempt to unravel how this mutant contributes to PD/MSA. Our results show that the G51D mutation significantly attenuates α-Syn aggregation in vitro. Moreover, it disrupts local helix formation in the presence of SDS, decreases binding to lipid vesicles C-terminal to the site of mutation and severely inhibits helical folding in the presence of acidic vesicles. When expressed in yeast, α-SynG51D behaves similarly to α-SynA30P, as both exhibit impaired membrane association, form few inclusions and are non-toxic. In contrast, enhanced secreted and nuclear levels of the G51D mutant were observed in mammalian cells, as well as in primary neurons, where α-SynG51D was enriched in the nuclear compartment, was hyper-phosphorylated at S129 and exacerbated α-Syn-induced mitochondrial fragmentation. Finally, post-mortem human brain tissues of α-SynG51D cases were examined, and revealed only partial colocalization with nuclear membrane markers, probably due to post-mortem tissue delay and fixation. These findings suggest that the PD-linked mutations may cause neurodegeneration via different mechanisms, some of which may be independent of α-Syn aggregation.",

Activating the heat shock response (HSR) – and thus generally restoring the disturbed protein homeostasis associated with such diseases – has often been suggested as a therapeutic strategy. However, most data on activating the HSR or its downstream targets in mouse models of diseases associated with aggregate formation have been rather disappointing. The human chaperonome consists of many more heat shock proteins (HSPs) that are not regulated by the HSR, however, and researchers are now focusing on these as potential therapeutic targets. In this Review, we summarize the existing literature on a set of aggregation diseases and propose that each of them can be characterized or ‘barcoded’ by a different set of HSPs that can rescue specific types of aggregation. Some of these ‘non-canonical’ HSPs have demonstrated effectiveness in vivo, in mouse models of protein-aggregation disease. Interestingly, several of these HSPs also cause diseases when mutated – so-called chaperonopathies – which are also discussed in this Review.",Chaperonopathies;Heat shock protein;Protein-aggregation diseases

Despite much effort, the precise mechanism by which amelogenin regulates enamel formation is not fully understood. To assist efforts aimed at understanding the biochemical mechanism of enamel formation, more facile protocols to purify recombinantly expressed amelogenin, ideally without any tag to assist affinity purification, are advantageous. Here we describe an improved method to purify milligram quantities of amelogenin that exploits its high solubility in 2% glacial acetic acid under conditions of low ionic strength. The method involves heating the frozen cell pellet for two 15 min periods at −70 °C with 2 min of sonication in between, dialysis twice in 2% acetic acid (1:250 v/v), and reverse phase chromatography. A further improvement in yield is obtained by resuspending the frozen cell pellet in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride in the first step. The acetic acid heating method is illustrated with a murine amelogenin containing the corresponding P70 → T point mutation observed in an human amelogenin associated with amelogenesis imperfecta (P71T), while the guanidine hydrochloride heating method is illustrated with wild type murine amelogenin (M180). The self-assembly properties of P71T were probed by NMR chemical shift perturbation studies as a function of protein (0.1–1.8 mM) and NaCl (0–367 mM) concentration. Relative to similar studies with wild type murine amelogenin, P71T self-associates at lower protein or salt concentrations with the interactions initiated near the N-terminus.",Amelogenesis imperfecta;Intrinsic disorder;Amelogenin;Tooth enamel;Biomineralization;NMR spectroscopy

Mutations of the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene are the most prevalent cause of classical RTT cases. MECP2 mutations or altered expression are also associated with a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders with recent links to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Collectively, MeCP2 relation to these neurodevelopmental disorders highlights the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms by which MeCP2 impacts brain development, mental conditions, and compromised brain function. Since MECP2 mutations were discovered to be the primary cause of RTT, a significant progress has been made in the MeCP2 research, with respect to the expression, function and regulation of MeCP2 in the brain and its contribution in RTT pathogenesis. To date, there have been intensive efforts in designing effective therapeutic strategies for RTT benefiting from mouse models and cells collected from RTT patients. Despite significant progress in MeCP2 research over the last few decades, there is still a knowledge gap between the in vitro and in vivo research findings and translating these findings into effective therapeutic interventions in human RTT patients. In this review, we will provide a synopsis of Rett syndrome as a severe neurological disorder and will discuss the role of MeCP2 in RTT pathophysiology.",Epigenetics;DNA methylation;MeCP2;MeCP2E1;MeCP2E2;MeCP2 isoforms;Rett syndrome;Autism spectrum disorders;Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders

SFS has been shown to bind to fibronectin (FN) and block interaction of FN with type I collagen. We have characterized interactions of a recombinant 60-mer polypeptide, R1R2, with FN. R1R2 contains two copies of collagen-like 19-residue repeats. Experiments utilizing various FN fragments and epitope-mapped anti-FN monoclonal antibodies located the binding site to 8-9FNI modules of the gelatin-binding domain. Fluorescence polarization and competitive enzyme-linked assays demonstrated that R1R2 binds preferentially to compact dimeric FN rather than monomeric constructs containing 8-9FNI or a large dimeric FN construct that is constitutively in an extended conformation. In contrast to bacterial peptides that bind 2–5FNI in addition to 8-9FNI, R1R2 did not cause conformational extension of FN as assessed by a conformationally sensitive antibody. Equilibrium and stopped-flow binding assays and size exclusion chromatography were compatible with a two-step binding reaction in which each of the repeats of R1R2 interacts with one of the subunits of dimeric FN, resulting in a stable complex with a slow koff. In addition to not binding to type I collagen, the R1R2·FN complex incorporated less efficiently into extracellular matrix than free FN. Thus, R1R2 binds to FN utilizing features of compact soluble FN and in doing so interferes with the organization of the extracellular matrix. A similar bivalent binding strategy may underlie the collagen-FN interaction.",Collagen;Fibronectin;Intrinsically Disordered Protein;Kinetics;Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP);Bacterial Protein;FNI Modules;Host-Pathogen Interactions;Streptococcus equi

We already introduced one example in section 2.2.4.3: Redesign of Manganese Centers (Mn-substituted CA506,507). Using the same strategy, Kazlauskas and co-workers have carried out the design of a rhodium-substituted CA (CA-[Rh]) that catalyzes the stereoselective hydrogenation of olefin and the regioselective hydroformylation of styrene.530,531 To minimize the nonspecific binding of rhodium to the surface residues of the protein, particularly His and Lys, they carried out either site-directed mutagenesis or a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and modification of His residues using the His-selective reagent diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) to prevent rhodium binding. Rhodium-substituted WT-CA and several mutants with low surface-bound rhodium ions were selected to test for cis-stilbene hydrogenation.530 While the hydrogenation was observed under 5 atm of H2, the isomerization product was also generated during the reaction. The isomerization was thought to be catalyzed by the surface-bound rhodium because the reaction catalyzed by mutants with low surface-bound rhodium produced a significantly lower level of the trans isomer. In addition, the authors demonstrated that the rhodium bound to the active site of CA selectively catalyze the hydrogenation of cis-stilbene over trans-stilbene. This selectivity was attributed to the structure of the hydrophobic pocket defined by a few active-site Val, Leu, and Trp residues. Furthermore, Kazlauska and co-workers investigated the hydroformylation activity of CA-[Rh].531 They showed that both rhodium-substituted WT-CA and several mutants with lower surface-bound rhodium were able to catalyze the hydroformylation of styrene into 3-phenylpropanal (linear) and 2-phenylpropanal (branched). It was also shown that the production of the linear product was due to the CA-active-site rhodium instead of the surface rhodium. The highest selectivity reported was approximately 8.4-fold linear aldehyde over branched aldehyde. Computer modeling was employed to explain the regioselectivity, which showed that the active site accommodates the linear aldehyde with the carbonyl group closer to the rhodium center, a feature that is important for the reductive elimination reaction.",

However, little is known about the natural regulators of CD74 in this context. In order to study the role of the HLA-DR molecule in regulating CD74, we utilized the HLA-DRα1 domain, which was shown to bind to and downregulate CD74 on CD11b+ monocytes. We found that DRα1 directly inhibited binding of MIF to CD74 and blocked its downstream inflammatory effects in the spinal cord of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Potency of the DRα1 domain could be destroyed by trypsin digestion but enhanced by addition of a peptide extension (MOG-35–55 peptide) that provided secondary structure not present in DRα1. These data suggest a conformationally-sensitive determinant on DRα1-MOG that is responsible for optimal binding to CD74 and antagonism of MIF effects, resulting in reduced axonal damage and reversal of ongoing clinical and histological signs of EAE. These results demonstrate natural antagonist activity of DRα1 for MIF that was strongly potentiated by the MOG peptide extension, resulting in a novel therapeutic, DRα1-MOG-35–55,that within the limitations of the EAE model may have the potential to treat autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis.",HLA-DRα1;CD74;Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF);multiple sclerosis

Upon interaction of its C-terminal hemolysin moiety with the cell surface receptor αMβ2 integrin, the N-terminal cyclase domain translocates into the host cell cytosol where it rapidly generates supraphysiological cAMP concentrations, which inhibit host cell anti-bacterial activities. Although ACT has been shown to induce protective immunity in mice, it is not included in any current acellular pertussis vaccines due to protein stability issues and a poor understanding of its role as a protective antigen. Here, we aimed to determine whether any single domain could recapitulate the antibody responses induced by the holo-toxin and to characterize the dominant neutralizing antibody response. We first immunized mice with ACT and screened antibody phage display libraries for binding to purified ACT. The vast majority of unique antibodies identified bound the C-terminal repeat-in-toxin (RTX) domain. Representative antibodies binding two nonoverlapping, neutralizing epitopes in the RTX domain prevented ACT association with J774A.1 macrophages and soluble αMβ2 integrin, suggesting that these antibodies inhibit the ACT-receptor interaction. Sera from mice immunized with the RTX domain showed similar neutralizing activity as ACT-immunized mice, indicating that this domain induced an antibody response similar to that induced by ACT.

In dopaminergic neurons, αS exists in a tightly regulated equilibrium between water-soluble and membrane-associated forms. Here we used a combination of solid-state and solution-state NMR spectroscopy to characterize the conformations of αS bound to lipid membranes mimicking the composition and physical properties of synaptic vesicles. The study evidences three αS regions possessing distinct structural and dynamical properties, including an N-terminal helical segment having a role of membrane-anchor, an unstructured C-terminal region that is weakly associated with the membrane, and a central region acting as a sensor of the lipid properties and determining the affinity of αS membrane binding. Taken together, our data define the nature of the interactions of αS with biological membranes and provide insights into their roles in the function and in the molecular processes leading the aggregation of this protein.",

Dysregulation of the host responses to LPS can lead to a systemic inflammatory condition named sepsis. In a typical scenario, activation of TLR4 is preceded by binding of LPS to CD14 protein anchored in cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich microdomains of the plasma membrane called rafts. CD14 then transfers the LPS to the TLR4/MD-2 complex which dimerizes and triggers MyD88- and TRIF-dependent production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons. The TRIF-dependent signaling is linked with endocytosis of the activated TLR4, which is controlled by CD14. In addition to CD14, other raft proteins like Lyn tyrosine kinase of the Src family, acid sphingomyelinase, CD44, Hsp70, and CD36 participate in the TLR4 signaling triggered by LPS and non-microbial endogenous ligands. In this review, we summarize the current state of the knowledge on the involvement of rafts in TLR4 signaling, with an emphasis on how the raft proteins regulate the TLR4 signaling pathways. CD14-bearing rafts, and possibly CD36-rich rafts, are believed to be preferred sites of the assembly of a multimolecular complex which mediates the endocytosis of activated TLR4.",Lipopolysaccharide;Toll-like receptor 4;Plasma membrane rafts;CD14;Lyn tyrosine kinase;Acid sphingomyelinase;CD36

Initial animal models indicated a degree of compensatory overlap between ID genes such that deletion of multiple ID genes was required to generate easily recognizable phenotypes. More recently, new model systems have revealed alterations in mice harboring deletions in single ID genes suggesting complex gene and tissue specific functions for members of the ID gene family. Because ID genes are highly expressed during development and their function is associated with a primitive, proliferative cellular phenotype there has been significant interest in understanding their potential roles in neoplasia. Indeed, numerous studies indicate an oncogenic function for ID1, 2 and 3. In contrast, the inhibitor of differentiation 4 (ID4) presents a paradigm shift in context of well-established role of ID1, 2 and 3 in development and cancer. Apart from some degree of functional redundancy such as HLH dependent interactions with bHLH protein E2A, many of the functions of ID4 are distinct from ID1, 2 and 3: ID4 proteins a) regulate distinct developmental processes and tissue expression in the adult, b) promotes stem cell survival, differentiation and/or timing of differentiation, c) epigenetic inactivation/loss of expression in several advanced stage cancers and d) increased expression in some cancers such as those arising in the breast and ovary. Thus, in spite of sharing the conserved HLH domain, ID4 defies the established model of ID protein function and expression. The underlying molecular mechanism responsible for the unique role of ID4 as compared to other ID proteins still remains largely un-explored.

It has been proposed that some of these symptoms might be related to the widespread pathology of α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation in different nuclei of the central and peripheral nervous system. However, the pathogenic formation of α-syn aggregates in different brain areas of PD patients is poorly understood. Most experimental models of PD are valuable to assess specific aspects of its pathogenesis, such as toxin-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. However, new models are required that reflect the widespread and progressive formation of α-syn aggregates in different brain areas. Such α-syn aggregation is induced in only a few animal models, for example perikaryon inclusions are found in rats administered rotenone, aggregates with a neuritic morphology develop in mice overexpressing either mutated or wild-type α-syn, and in Smad3 deficient mice, aggregates form extensively in the perikaryon and neurites of specific brain nuclei. In this review we focus on α-syn aggregation in the human disorder, its genetics and the availability of experimental models. Indeed, evidences show that dopamine (DA) metabolism may be related to α-syn and its conformational plasticity, suggesting an interesting link between the two pathological hallmarks of PD: dopaminergic neurodegeneration and Lewy body (LB) formation.",α-synuclein;Parkinson’s disease;Lewy body;Animal models;Smad3;Rotenone

We found that the free form BoNT/A maintains a pH-independent conformation with limited domain flexibility. Intriguingly, the free form NTNHA-A adopts pH-dependent conformational changes due to a torsional motion of its C-terminal domain. Once forming a complex at acidic pH, they each adopt a stable conformation that is similar to that observed in the crystal structure of the M-PTC. Our results suggest that assembly of the M-PTC depends on the environmental pH, and that the complex form of BoNT/A is induced by interacting with NTNHA-A at acidic pH.",botulinum neurotoxin;bacterial toxin;neurotoxin-associated proteins;non-toxic non-hemagglutinin;progenitor toxin complex;protein complex;X-ray scattering

Two in-house computational tools were created and used to visualize and interpret the data through both alignment of the peptide quasi-molecular ion intensities and estimation of the differential enzyme participation. These results reveal that the endogenous proteolytic activity in the mammary gland is remarkably specific and well conserved. Certain proteins—not necessarily the most abundant ones—are digested by the proteases present in milk, yielding endogenous peptides from selected regions. Our results strongly suggest that factors such as the presence of specific proteases, the position and concentration of cleavage sites, and, more important, the intrinsic disorder of segments of the protein drive this proteolytic specificity in the mammary gland. As a consequence of this selective hydrolysis, proteins that typically need to be cleaved at specific positions in order to exert their activity are properly digested, and bioactive peptides encoded in certain protein sequences are released.

Small molecules cross the NPC by passive diffusion, but molecules larger than ~5 nm must bind to nuclear transport receptors to overcome a selective barrier within the NPC1. Whilst the structure and shape of the cytoplasmic ring of the NPC are relatively well characterized2-5, the selective barrier is situated deep within the central channel of the NPC and depends critically on unstructured nuclear pore proteins5,6, and is therefore not well understood. Here, we show that stiffness topography7 with sharp atomic force microscopy tips can generate nanoscale cross sections of the NPC. The cross sections reveal two distinct structures, a cytoplasmic ring and a central plug structure, which are consistent with the three-dimensional NPC structure derived from electron microscopy2-5. The central plug persists after reactivation of the transport cycle and resultant cargo release, indicating that the plug is an intrinsic part of the NPC barrier. Added nuclear transport receptors accumulate on the intact transport barrier and lead to a homogenization of the barrier stiffness. The observed nanomechanical properties in the NPC indicate the presence of a cohesive barrier to transport, and are quantitatively consistent with the presence of a central condensate of nuclear pore proteins in the NPC channel.",

genes giving rise to circadian rhythms8 have been identified in diverse model organisms, including
mammals,9 the fungus Neurospora
crassa,10 the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,11 a
small flowering plant from the mustard family, Arabidopsis
thaliana,12 and the cyanobacterium Synechococcous elongatus.13 Key
rhythms generated in all these systems concern oscillations in the
transcripts and/or proteins of particular clock genes and are sustained
by autoregulatory feedback loops.14,15 Examples are mPer1, mPer2, and mPer3 as well as cry1, cry2, and Bmal1 in mammals, clk, per, and tim in the fly, frq and WC-1
in Neurospora, and kaiA and kaiBC in the cyanobacteria. The core clock mechanism in
the mammalian clock entails the transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1
that form a heterodimer to activate transcription of the Period (Per) and Cryptochrome (Cry) genes (DOI: 10.1021/bi500707c). The negative arm of this TTFL is comprised of the PER and CRY
proteins that heterodimerize and interact with CLOCK:BMAL1 after translocating back
to the nucleus to inhibit their own transcription.
The robustness of this primary TTFL is enhanced by a secondary feedback
loop that involves nuclear hormone receptors Rev-erbs and RORs that act as negative and positive regulators,
respectively, of BMAL1 transcription. By contrast, a very different
set of proteins forms the circadian timer in the simplest organisms
to possess a clock, the cyanobacteria, e.g., S. elongatus.16,17 The fact that the KaiA and KaiC proteins
positively and negatively regulate kaiBC transcription,
respectively,13 is consistent with a TTFL
model. However, the subsequent findings that the cyanobacterial clock
ticks without de novo synthesis of clock gene mRNAs18 and that the clock can be reconstituted in vitro from the KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC proteins in the presence
of ATP19 point to a nontranscriptional
oscillator (NTO) (DOI: 10.1021/bi501089x) as
the driving force of circadian rhythm in these organisms. Indeed,
it was shown that this KaiABC post-translational oscillator (PTO)
represents the master timer, with the TTFL and clock-controlled gene
expression being under its control.20,21 No evolutionary
relationship appears to exist between the molecular players in the
KaiABC PTO and the CLOCK/BMAL1-driven master TTFL in mammals. Therefore,
clocks may have arisen by evolution on Earth more than once, endowing
organisms with a powerful tool to anticipate periodic environmental
changes and an adequate response at their disposal. The contribution
in this Current Topic collection on clocks in algae by Noordally and
Millar discusses the gating of cell division by the circadian clock
in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and its initiation coinciding
with the beginning of the subjective night (DOI: 10.1021/bi501089x). Thus, C. reinhardtii may minimize the potentially
detrimental effects of UV radiation on nuclear DNA replication.22 This observation provides support for the “escape
from light” hypothesis that postulated an early adaptive advantage
for organisms by shifting cellular processes sensitive to light into
the subjective night phase.23",

However, the pathways and interacting proteins that could shed light on pathogenesis of SelS-associated diseases have not been studied systematically. We performed a large-scale affinity isolation of human SelS and its mutant forms and analyzed proteins that interact with them. All previously known SelS targets and nearly two hundred additional proteins were identified, which were remarkably enriched for various multiprotein complexes. Subsequent chemical cross-linking experiments identified the specific interacting sites in SelS and its several targets. Most of these interactions involved coiled coil domains.

Each protein was crystallized with multiple substrates or ligands (lactate, malate, and oxamate inhibitor) and with NADH (resolution ranging from 1.35 Å to 2.05 Å). Unfortunately, in all crystals with malate, the malate spontaneously converted to pyruvate and/or lactate via redox reactions and decarboxylation. In the crystals constructed with AncMDH2 and lactate, a phosphate was seen in the active site rather than lactate. In the following, therefore, the descriptions of the models are primarily based on enzymes crystallized with oxamate inhibitor or lactate, which are highly similar.

All CBCRs examined to date utilize a conserved Cys residue to form a covalent thioether linkage to the bilin chromophore. In the insert-Cys CBCR subfamily, a second conserved Cys can covalently link to the bilin C10 methine bridge, allowing detection of near-UV to blue light. The best understood insert-Cys CBCR is the violet/orange CBCR NpF2164g3 from Nostoc punctiforme, which has a stable second linkage in the violet-absorbing dark state. Photoconversion of NpF2164g3 leads to elimination of the second linkage and formation of an orange-absorbing photoproduct. We recently reported NMR chemical shift assignments for the orange-absorbing photoproduct state of NpF2164g3. We here present equivalent information for its violet-absorbing dark state. In both photostates, NpF2164g3 is monomeric in solution and regions containing the two conserved Cys residues essential for photoconversion are structurally disordered. In contrast to blue light receptors such as phototropin, NpF2164g3 is less structurally ordered in the dark state than in the photoproduct. The insert-Cys insertion loop and C-terminal helix exhibit light-dependent structural changes. Moreover, a motif containing an Asp residue also found in other CBCRs and in phytochromes adopts a random-coil structure in the dark state but a stable α-helix structure in the photoproduct. NMR analysis of the chromophore is consistent with a less ordered dark state, with A-ring resonances only resolved in the photoproduct. The C10 atom of the bilin chromophore exhibits a drastic change in chemical shift upon photoconversion, changing from 34.5 ppm (methylene) in the dark state to 115 ppm (methine) in the light-activated state.

Simple repeat patterns generated by DNA slippage tend to introduce length variations and point mutations in repeat regions. Loss of normal and gain of abnormal function owing to their variable length are potential risks leading to diseases. Repeats with complex patterns mostly refer to the functional domain repeats, such as the well-known leucine-rich repeat and WD repeat, which are frequently involved in protein–protein interaction. They are mainly derived from internal gene duplication events and stabilized by ‘gate-keeper’ residues, which play crucial roles in preventing inter-domain aggregation. AARs are widely distributed in different proteomes across a variety of taxonomic ranges, and especially abundant in eukaryotic proteins. However, their specific evolutionary and functional scenarios are still poorly understood. Identifying AARs in protein sequences is the first step for the further investigation of their biological function and evolutionary mechanism. In principle, this is an NP-hard problem, as most of the repeat fragments are shaped by a series of sophisticated evolutionary events and become latent periodical patterns. It is not possible to define a uniform criterion for detecting and verifying various repeat patterns. Instead, different algorithms based on different strategies have been developed to cope with different repeat patterns. In this review, we attempt to describe the amino acid repeat-detection algorithms currently available and compare their strategies based on an in-depth analysis of the biological significance of protein repeats.",amino acid repeat;detection algorithm;low complexity sequence;repeat containing protein;protein domain repeats

crescentus strain (NA1000/CB15N) because the thin
Caulobacter cells are most suitable for electron cryotomography.
When a log-phase culture was plunge-frozen and imaged, many dividing cells could be
found. At the division sites, a series of dots arranged in a single line were found
(Figure 1A, top). Careful analysis of
cellular tomograms (Video 1 and Figure 1A, bottom) revealed that the dots were in
fact 2D projections of filamentous structures encircling the cell and likely forming
a continuous ring, disrupted in the images at the top and bottom by the missing wedge
of the tomography method. The filaments were at a distance of 15 ± 2 nm from the
inner membrane (Figure 1B), as previously
reported (Li et al., 2007). The
long-standing problem of the missing wedge in electron tomography caused by our
current inability to tilt the specimen much beyond 65° (Figure 1A, bottom, white triangle, see also Figure 1—figure supplement 1 for more details on the
missing wedge problem related to this study) makes it impossible to follow features
all the way around the cell's perimeter. It is important to note, however, that the
protein filaments are visible and uninterrupted everywhere the missing wedge allows
it, as can be gauged from the disappearance of the cell membrane and envelope (Figure 1A,B). We could detect the filamentous
rings in 20 out of 28 dividing cells after tomography. Of the 8 without obvious
filamentous structures, the division had progressed too far in 3 and 5 were of poor
quality because of the cell's orientation with respect to the tilt axis (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Hence,
the finding of complete rings is supported by the fact that perfect coincidence of
any hypothetical gaps in constricting rings with the missing wedges in all of the
analysed tomograms, found after all in entirely random orientations, would be
remarkably implausible.",E. coli

Although no enzymatic activity could be attributed yet to the HCV non-structural protein 5A (NS5A), it is indispensable for viral replication and particle assembly. Furthermore, it is associated with a variety of cellular pathways, although their relevance for viral pathogenesis still has to be elucidated. To fulfil its function NS5A interacts with a large number of different proteins including both viral and human ones. NS5A is organized into three domains, which are connected via two low complexity sequences (LCS). The first domain is highly conserved among different HCV genotypes and forms a well-defined globular structure [1]. The domains 2 (D2) and 3 (D3) are less conserved and intrinsically disordered. Nonetheless, three segments in LCS-I and D2 show significant propensities to adopt α-helical structures as could be shown by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shift and 15N relaxation data [2]. The LCS-II connecting D2 and D3 contains two directly neighbored class II PxxP-motifs, which are important for interactions with Src homology 3 (SH3) domains. SH3 domains mediate protein-protein interactions, often via binding to polyproline II helices. Recent studies also revealed alternative binding mechanisms, mainly involving helical motifs and positively charged amino acid residues. The SH3 domain of the bridging integrator 1 (Bin1) is known to interact with NS5A not only via its PxxP-motifs, but also via two non-canonical binding sites, which will be further described here [3].",

However, it remains unclear how microbial sensing initiates chromatin remodeling. Here, we show that Akirin2, an evolutionarily conserved nuclear protein, bridges NF-κB and the chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex by interacting with BRG1-Associated Factor 60 (BAF60) proteins as well as IκB-ζ, which forms a complex with the NF-κB p50 subunit. These interactions are essential for Toll-like receptor-, RIG-I-, and Listeria-mediated expression of proinflammatory genes including Il6 and Il12b in macrophages. Consistently, effective clearance of Listeria infection required Akirin2. Furthermore, Akirin2 and IκB-ζ recruitment to the Il6 promoter depend upon the presence of IκB-ζ and Akirin2, respectively, for regulation of chromatin remodeling. BAF60 proteins were also essential for the induction of Il6 in response to LPS stimulation. Collectively, the IκB-ζ–Akirin2–BAF60 complex physically links the NF-κB and SWI/SNF complexes in innate immune cell activation. By recruiting SWI/SNF chromatin remodellers to IκB-ζ, transcriptional coactivator for NF-κB, the conserved nuclear protein Akirin2 stimulates pro-inflammatory gene promoters in mouse macrophages during innate immune responses to viral or bacterial infection.",chromatin remodeling;cytokine;gene regulation;innate immunity;macrophages

Protein fold recognition and protein secondary structure prediction are transitional steps in identifying the three dimensional structure of a protein. For protein fold recognition, evolutionary-based information of amino acid sequences from the position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) has been recently applied with improved results. On the other hand, the SPINE-X predictor has been developed and applied for protein secondary structure prediction. Several reported methods for protein fold recognition have only limited accuracy. In this paper, we have developed a strategy of combining evolutionary-based information (from PSSM) and predicted secondary structure using SPINE-X to improve protein fold recognition. The strategy is based on finding the probabilities of amino acid pairs (AAP). The proposed method has been tested on several protein benchmark datasets and an improvement of 8.9% recognition accuracy has been achieved. We have achieved, for the first time over 90% and 75% prediction accuracies for sequence similarity values below 40% and 25%, respectively.

The protein is composed of 2 N-terminal domains (N1 and N2), 2 proline-rich regions (PRR1 and PRR2) that flank a histidine-rich region (HRR), and a C-terminal domain. To date, structural information of HRG has largely come from sequence analysis and spectroscopic studies. It is thought that an HRG fragment containing the HRR, released via plasmin-mediated cleavage, acts as a negative regulator of angiogenesis in vivo. However, its release also requires cleavage of a disulphide bond suggesting that its activity is mediated by a redox process. Here, we present a 1.93 Å resolution crystal structure of the N2 domain of serum-purified rabbit HRG. The structure confirms that the N2 domain, which along with the N1 domain, forms an important molecular interaction site on HRG, possesses a cystatin-like fold composed of a 5-stranded antiparallel β-sheet wrapped around a 5-turn α-helix. A native N-linked glycosylation site was identified at Asn184. Moreover, the structure reveals the presence of an S-glutathionyl adduct at Cys185, which has implications for the redox-mediated release of the antiangiogenic cleavage product from HRG.",

A common theme has emerged that inappropriate self-aggregation of misfolded or mutant polypeptide sequences is detrimental to cell health. Yet protein quality control mechanisms may also deliberately cluster them together into distinct inclusion subtypes, including the insoluble protein deposit (IPOD) and the juxtanuclear quality control (JUNQ). Here we investigated how the intrinsic oligomeric state of three model systems of disease-relevant mutant protein and peptide sequences relates to the IPOD and JUNQ patterns of aggregation using sedimentation velocity analysis. Two of the models (polyalanine (37A) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mutants A4V and G85R) accumulated into the same JUNQ-like inclusion whereas the other, polyglutamine (72Q), formed spatially distinct IPOD-like inclusions. Using flow cytometry pulse shape analysis (PulSA) to separate cells with inclusions from those without revealed the SOD1 mutants and 37A to have abruptly altered oligomeric states with respect to the nonaggregating forms, regardless of whether cells had inclusions or not, whereas 72Q was almost exclusively monomeric until inclusions formed. We propose that mutations leading to JUNQ inclusions induce a constitutively “misfolded” state exposing hydrophobic side chains that attract and ultimately overextend protein quality capacity, which leads to aggregation into JUNQ inclusions. Poly(Q) is not misfolded in this same sense due to universal polar side chains, but is highly prone to forming amyloid fibrils that we propose invoke a different engagement mechanism with quality control.",Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's Disease);Analytical Ultracentrifugation;Flow Cytometry;Polyglutamine;Protein Aggregation;Superoxide Dismutase (SOD);Inclusion;Polyalanine

Formally postulated over a decade ago, it is becoming increasingly clear that post-translational modifications (PTMs) on histones act singly and in combination to form a language or ‘code’ that is read by specialized proteins to facilitate downstream functions in chromatin. Underappreciated at the time was the level of complexity harbored both within histone PTMs and their combinations, as well as within the proteins that read and interpret the language. In addition to histone PTMs, newly-identified DNA modifications that can recruit specific effector proteins has raised further awareness that histone PTMs operate within a broader language of epigenetic modifications to orchestrate the dynamic functions associated with chromatin.

HR is commonly considered to be error-free, but several studies have shown that HR can be error-prone. Here, we discuss the actual accuracy of HR. First, we present the product of genetic exchanges (gene conversion, GC, and crossing over, CO) and the mechanisms of HR during double strand break repair and replication restart. We discuss the intrinsic capacities of HR to generate genome rearrangements by GC or CO, either during DSB repair or replication restart. During this process, abortive HR intermediates generate genetic instability and cell toxicity. In addition to genome rearrangements, HR also primes error-prone DNA synthesis and favors mutagenesis on single stranded DNA, a key DNA intermediate during the HR process. The fact that cells have developed several mechanisms protecting against HR excess emphasize its potential risks. Consistent with this duality, several pro-oncogenic situations have been consistently associated with either decreased or increased HR levels. Nevertheless, this versatility also has advantages that we outline here. We conclude that HR is a double-edged sword, which on one hand controls the equilibrium between genome stability and diversity but, on the other hand, can jeopardize the maintenance of genomic integrity. Therefore, whether non-homologous end joining (which, in contrast with HR, is not intrinsically mutagenic) or HR is the more mutagenic process is a question that should be re-evaluated. Both processes can be “Dr. Jekyll” in maintaining genome stability/variability and “Mr. Hyde” in jeopardizing genome integrity.",Homologous recombination;mutagenesis;DNA double strand break repair;replication stress;genetic variability;genetic instability

Although α-catenin binds to β-catenin and to F-actin, β-catenin significantly weakens the affinity of α-catenin for F-actin. Moreover, α-catenin self-associates into homodimers that block β-catenin binding. We investigated quantitatively and structurally αE- and αN-catenin dimer formation, their interaction with β-catenin and the cadherin·β-catenin complex, and the effect of the α-catenin actin-binding domain on β-catenin association. The two α-catenin variants differ in their self-association properties: at physiological temperatures, αE-catenin homodimerizes 10× more weakly than does αN-catenin but is kinetically trapped in its oligomeric state. Both αE- and αN-catenin bind to β-catenin with a Kd of 20 nm, and this affinity is increased by an order of magnitude when cadherin is bound to β-catenin.

This compartmentalization imposes a requirement for a transport network of macromolecules to shuttle these components in and out of the nucleus. This nucleo‐cytoplasmic transport of macromolecules is critical for both cell physiology and pathology. Consequently, investigating its regulation and disease‐associated alterations can reveal novel therapeutic approaches to fight human diseases, such as cancer or viral infection. The characterization of the nuclear pore complex, the identification of transport signals and transport receptors, as well as the characterization of the Ran system (providing the energy source for efficient cargo transport) has greatly facilitated our understanding of the components, mechanisms and regulation of the nucleo‐cytoplasmic transport of proteins in our cells. Here we review this knowledge with a specific emphasis on the selection of disease‐relevant molecular targets for potential therapeutic intervention.",anti‐cancer therapy;anti‐viral therapy;karyopherins;nuclear export;nuclear import;nuclear pore complex;nuclear trafficking

However, in addition to the FRET of sequence-specific interactions, these experiments invariably record a contribution due to proximity FRET, which occurs when a donor and an acceptor approach each other by chance within distances of ∼100 Å. This effect does not reflect specific interactions in the membrane and is frequently unappreciated, despite the fact that its magnitude can be significant. Here we develop a computational description of proximity FRET, simulating the cases of proximity FRET when fluorescent proteins are used to tag monomeric, dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric membrane proteins, as well as membrane proteins existing in monomer-dimer equilibria. We also perform rigorous experimental measurements of this effect, by identifying membrane receptors that do not associate in mammalian membranes. We measure the FRET efficiencies between yellow fluorescent protein and mCherry-tagged versions of these receptors in plasma-membrane-derived vesicles as a function of receptor concentration. Finally, we demonstrate that the experimental measurements are well described by our predictions. The work presented here brings additional rigor to FRET-based studies of membrane protein interactions, and should have broad utility in membrane biophysics research.",

They are formed by head-to-head association of two hemichannels (HCs), one from each of the adjacent cells. Functional HCs are connexin hexamers composed of one or more connexin isoforms. Deafness is the most frequent sensineural disorder, and mutations of Cx26 are the most common cause of genetic deafness. Cx43 is the most ubiquitous connexin, expressed in many organs, tissues, and cell types, including heart, brain, and kidney. Alterations in its expression and function play important roles in the pathophysiology of very frequent medical problems such as those related to cardiac and brain ischemia. There is extensive information on the relationship between phosphorylation and Cx43 targeting, location, and function from experiments in cells and organs in normal and pathological conditions. However, the molecular mechanisms of Cx43 regulation by phosphorylation are hard to tackle in complex systems. Here, we present the use of purified HCs as a model for functional and structural studies. Cx26 and Cx43 are the only isoforms that have been purified, reconstituted, and subjected to functional and structural analysis. Purified Cx26 and Cx43 HCs have properties compatible with those demonstrated in cells, and present methodologies for the functional analysis of purified HCs reconstituted in liposomes. We show that phosphorylation of serine 368 by PKC produces a partial closure of the Cx43 HCs, changing solute selectivity. We also present evidence that the effect of phosphorylation is highly cooperative, requiring modification of several connexin subunits, and that phosphorylation of serine 368 elicits conformational changes in the purified HCs. The use of purified HCs is starting to provide critical data to understand the regulation of HCs at the molecular level.",purification;method;gap junction;phosphorylation;PKC;calcium;ATP;permeability

Our understanding of viral biology and pathophysiology and our ability to develop a more effective antiviral arsenal would greatly benefit from a more comprehensive picture of the events that lead to viral replication and associated symptoms. Towards this goal, the construction of virus-host interactomes is instrumental, mainly relying on the assumption that a viral infection at the cellular level can be viewed as a number of perturbations introduced into the host protein network when viral proteins make new connections and disrupt existing ones. Here, we review advances in interactomic approaches for viral infections, focusing on high-throughput screening (HTS) technologies and on the generation of high-quality datasets. We show how these are already beginning to offer intriguing perspectives in terms of virus-host cell biology and the control of cellular functions, and we conclude by offering a summary of the current situation regarding the potential development of host-oriented antiviral therapeutics.",

Previously, we showed that the SG-recruited IGF2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) interferes with target mRNA degradation during cellular stress. Whether this requires the formation of SGs remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the sustained inhibition of visible SGs requires the concomitant knockdown of TIA1, TIAR and G3BP1. FRAP and photo-conversion studies, however, indicate that these proteins only transiently associate with SGs. This suggests that instead of forming a rigid scaffold for mRNP recruitment, TIA proteins and G3BP1 promote SG-formation by constantly replenishing mRNPs. In contrast, RNA-binding proteins like IGF2BP1 or HUR, which are dispensable for SG-assembly, are stably associated with SGs and the IGF2BP1/HUR-G3BP1 association is increased during stress. The depletion of IGF2BP1 enhances the degradation of target mRNAs irrespective of inhibiting SG-formation, whereas the turnover of bulk mRNA remains unaffected when SG-formation is impaired. Together these findings indicate that the stabilization of mRNAs during cellular stress is facilitated by the formation of stable mRNPs, which are recruited to SGs by TIA proteins and/or G3BP1. Importantly, however, the aggregation of mRNPs to visible SGs is dispensable for preventing mRNA degradation.",

NHEJ is also needed for V(D)J recombination and the development of T and B cells in vertebrate immune systems, and acts in both the generation and prevention of non-homologous chromosomal translocations, a hallmark of genomic instability and many human cancers. X-ray crystal structures, cryo-electron microscopy envelopes, and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) solution conformations and assemblies are defining most of the core protein components for NHEJ: Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer; the DNA dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs); the structure-specific endonuclease Artemis along with polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (PNKP), aprataxin and PNKP related protein (APLF); the scaffolding proteins XRCC4 and XLF (XRCC4-like factor); DNA polymerases, and DNA ligase IV (Lig IV). The dynamic assembly of multi-protein NHEJ complexes at DSBs is regulated in part by protein phosphorylation. The basic steps of NHEJ have been biochemically defined to require: 1) DSB detection by the Ku heterodimer with subsequent DNA-PKcs tethering to form the DNA-PKcs-Ku-DNA complex (termed DNA-PK), 2) lesion processing, and 3) DNA end ligation by Lig IV, which functions in complex with XRCC4 and XLF. The current integration of structures by combined methods is resolving puzzles regarding the mechanisms, coordination and regulation of these three basic steps. Overall, structural results suggest the NHEJ system forms a flexing scaffold with the DNA-PKcs HEAT repeats acting as compressible macromolecular springs suitable to store and release conformational energy to apply forces to regulate NHEJ complexes and the DNA substrate for DNA end protection, processing, and ligation.",

PASylation, the genetic fusion with a long, conformationally disordered amino acid chain comprising Pro, Ala and Ser, provides a convenient way to expand protein size and, consequently, retard renal filtration. Humanized αHER2 and αCD20 Fabs were systematically fused with 100 to 600 PAS residues and produced in E. coli. Cytofluorimetric titration analysis on tumor cell lines confirmed that antigen-binding activities of the parental antibodies were retained. The radio-iodinated PASylated Fabs were studied by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and biodistribution analysis in mouse tumor xenograft models. While the unmodified αHER2 and αCD20 Fabs showed weak tumor uptake (0.8% and 0.2% ID/g, respectively; 24 h p.i.) tumor-associated radioactivity was boosted with increasing PAS length (up to 9 and 26-fold, respectively), approaching an optimum for Fab-PAS400. Remarkably, 6- and 5-fold higher tumor-to-blood ratios compared with the unmodified Fabs were measured in the biodistribution analysis (48 h p.i.) for αHER2 Fab-PAS100 and Fab-PAS200, respectively. These findings were confirmed by PET studies, showing high imaging contrast in line with tumor-to-blood ratios of 12.2 and 5.7 (24 h p.i.) for αHER2 Fab-PAS100 and Fab-PAS200. Even stronger tumor signals were obtained with the corresponding αCD20 Fabs, both in PET imaging and biodistribution analysis, with an uptake of 2.8% ID/g for Fab-PAS100
vs. 0.24% ID/g for the unmodified Fab. Hence, by engineering Fabs via PASylation, plasma half-life can be tailored to significantly improve tracer uptake and tumor contrast, thus optimally matching reagent/target interactions.",antibody fragment;CD20;HER2;PEGylation;plasma half-life;protein tracer

Proteins were separated by two-dimensional (2D)-electrophoresis and identified by mass spectrometry. We found 17 differentially expressed protein spots, as compared to control samples. We observed an increased expression of ASAP-2 in the RHD patients’ valves, while collagen-VI, haptoglobin-related protein, prolargin, and cartilage oligomeric protein showed reduced expression. Valve tissue of MXD patients, on the other hand, presented lower expression of annexin-A1 and A2, septin-2, SOD (Cu/Zn), and transgelin. Tissue samples from both valvopathies displayed higher expression of apolipoprotein-A1. Biglycan was downexpressed in both diseases.

Novel antiviral candidates targeting the nucleoprotein either induced higher order oligomers or reduced NP oligomerization by targeting the oligomerization loop and blocking its insertion into adjacent nucleoprotein subunit. In this study, we used a different structure-based approach to stabilize monomers of the nucleoprotein by drugs binding in its RNA-binding groove. We recently identified naproxen as a drug competing with RNA binding to NP with antiinflammatory and antiviral effects against influenza A virus. Here, we designed novel derivatives of naproxen by fragment extension for improved binding to NP. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that among these derivatives, naproxen A and C0 were most promising. Their chemical synthesis is described. Both derivatives markedly stabilized NP monomer against thermal denaturation. Naproxen C0 bound tighter to NP than naproxen at a binding site predicted by MD simulations and shown by competition experiments using wt NP or single-point mutants as determined by surface plasmon resonance. MD simulations suggested that impeded oligomerization and stabilization of monomeric NP is likely to be achieved by drugs binding in the RNA grove and inducing close to their binding site conformational changes of key residues hosting the oligomerization loop as observed for the naproxen derivatives. Naproxen C0 is a potential antiviral candidate blocking influenza nucleoprotein function.",viral RNA;nucleoprotein;oligomerization;molecular modelling;drug design

The interactions between Eph receptors and ephrins of the same subclass are promiscuous; there are cross-interactions between some subclasses, but not all. To understand how Eph-ephrin interactions can be both promiscuous and specific, we investigated sixteen energy landscapes of four Eph receptors (A2, A4, B2, and B4) interacting with four ephrin ligands (A1, A2, A5, and B2). We generated conformational ensembles and recognition energy landscapes starting from separated Eph and ephrin molecules and proceeding up to the formation of Eph-ephrin complexes. Analysis of the Eph-Ephrin recognition trajectories and the co-evolution entropy of 400 ligand binding domains of Eph receptor and 241 ephrin ligands identified conserved residues during the recognition process. Our study correctly predicted the promiscuity and specificity of the interactions and provided insights into their recognition. The dynamic conformational changes during Eph-ephrin recognition can be described by progressive conformational selection and population shift events, with two dynamic salt bridges between EphB4 and Ephrin-B2 contributing to the specific recognition. EphA3 cancer-related mutations lowered the binding energies. The specificity is not only controlled by the final stage of the interaction across the protein-protein interface, but also has large contributions from binding kinetics with the help of dynamic intermediates along the pathway from the separated Eph and ephrin to the Eph-ephrin complex.",Eph receptor tyrosine kinase;conformational selection;induced fit;protein-protein interaction;energy landscape;conformational dynamics

Currently, there are three major classes of DAA in clinical development: NS3/4A protease inhibitors, NS5B polymerase inhibitors, and NS5A directed inhibitors. Several compounds thought to bind directly with NS5A are now in various clinical trial phases, including the most advanced, daclatasvir (BMS-790052), ledipasvir (GS-5885), and ABT-267. While many NS5A-targeted compounds demonstrate picomolar potency, the exact mechanism(s) of their action is still unclear. In the clinic, NS5A HCV inhibitors show promise as important components in DAA regimens and have multifunctionality. In addition to inhibiting viral replication, they may synergize with other DAAs, possibly by modulating different viral proteins, to help suppress the emergence of resistant viruses. Structure-based models have identified target interaction domains and spatial interactions that explain drug resistance for mutations at specific positions (eg, residues 93 and 31) within NS5A and potential binding partners. This review provides, insights into the unique complexity of NS5A as a central platform for multiple viral/host protein interactions, and possible mechanism(s) for the NS5A inhibitors currently undergoing clinical trials that target this nonstructural viral protein.",HCV replication complex;direct acting antivirals (DAAs);clinical trials

In addition to generating functionally diverse protein isoforms from a single gene, ARS can alter the sequence contents of 5'/3' untranslated regions (UTRs) and intronic regions, thus also affecting the regulatory effects of these regions. ARS may introduce premature stop codon(s) into a transcript, and render the transcript susceptible to nonsense-mediated decay, which in turn can influence the overall gene expression level. Meanwhile, ARS can regulate the presence/absence of upstream open reading frames and microRNA targeting sites in 5'UTRs and 3'UTRs, respectively, thus affecting translational efficiencies and protein expression levels. Furthermore, since ARS may alter exon-intron structures, it can influence the biogenesis of intronic microRNAs and indirectly affect the expression of the target genes of these microRNAs. The connections between ARS and multiple regulatory mechanisms underline the importance of ARS in determining cell fate. Accumulating evidence indicates that ARS-coupled regulations play important roles in tumorigenesis.

Egea)","Survival of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum when it infects red blood cells depends upon its ability to export hundreds of its proteins beyond an encasing vacuole. Protein export is mediated by a parasite-derived protein complex, the Plasmodium translocon of exported proteins (PTEX), and requires unfolding of the different cargos prior to their translocation across the vacuolar membrane. Unfolding is performed by the AAA + protein unfoldase HSP101/ClpB2 and the thioredoxin-2 enzyme (TRX2). Protein trafficking is dramatically impaired in parasites with defective HSP101 or lacking TRX2. These two PTEX subunits drive export and are targets for the design of a novel class of antimalarials: protein export inhibitors. To rationalize inhibitor design, we solved the crystal structure of Pfal-TRX2 at 2.2-Å resolution. Within the asymmetric unit, the three different copies of this protein disulfide reductase sample its two redox catalytic states. Size exclusion chromatography and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analyses demonstrate that Pfal-TRX2 is monomeric in solution. A non-conserved N-terminal extension precedes the canonical thioredoxin-fold; although it is not observed in our structure, our solution analysis suggests it is flexible in contrast to Plasmodium thioredoxin-1. This represents a first step towards the reconstitution of the entire PTEX for mechanistic and structural studies.",Plasmodium falciparum;Protein translocon of exported proteins;Antimalarial design;Hybrid methods;Crystal structure;SAXS

There is conflicting information about where and how BBK32 interacts with FN. We have characterized interactions of a recombinant 86-mer polypeptide, “Bbk32,” comprising the unstructured FN-binding region of BBK32. Competitive enzyme-linked assays utilizing various FN fragments and epitope-mapped anti-FN monoclonal antibodies showed that Bbk32 binding involves both the fibrin-binding and the gelatin-binding domains of the 70-kDa N-terminal region (FN70K). Crystallographic and NMR analyses of smaller Bbk32 peptides complexed, respectively, with 2–3FNI and 8–9FNI, demonstrated that binding occurs by β-strand addition. Isothermal titration calorimetry indicated that Bbk32 binds to isolated FN70K more tightly than to intact FN. In a competitive enzyme-linked binding assay, complex formation with Bbk32 enhanced binding of FN with mAbIII-10 to the 10FNIII module. Thus, Bbk32 binds to multiple FN type 1 modules of the FN70K region by a tandem β-zipper mechanism, and in doing so increases accessibility of FNIII modules that interact with other ligands. The similarity in the FN-binding mechanism of BBK32 and previously studied streptococcal proteins suggests that the binding and associated conformational change of FN play a role in infection.",Bacterial Adhesion;Fibronectin;Protein Conformation;Protein Crystallization;Protein Structure;Host-Pathogen interactions;FNI Modules;Beta-Zipper Formation;Borrelia burgdorferi

Here we analyzed the secondary structures of nanoribbon amelogenin by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and tested if the structural motif matches previous data on the organic matrix of enamel. XRD analysis showed that a peak corresponding to 4.7 Å is present in nanoribbons of amelogenin. In addition, FTIR analysis showed that amelogenin in the form of nanoribbons was comprised of β-sheets by up to 75%, while amelogenin nanospheres had predominantly random-coil structure.

Capillary electrophoresis revealed that the net charge of ALS-variant SOD1 can be different in sign and in magnitude—by up to 7.4 units per dimer at lysosomal pH—than values predicted from standard pKa values of amino acids and formal oxidation states of metal ions. At pH 7.4, the G85R, D90A, and G93R substitutions diminished the net negative charge of dimeric SOD1 by up to +2.29 units more than predicted; E100K lowered net charge by less than predicted. The binding of a single Zn2+ to mutant SOD1 lowered its net charge by an additional +2.33 ± 0.01 to +3.18 ± 0.02 units, however, each protein regulated net charge when binding a second, third, or fourth Zn2+ (ΔZ < 0.44 ± 0.07 per additional Zn2+). Both metalated and apo-SOD1 regulated net charge across subcellular pH, without inverting from negative to positive at the theoretical pI. Differential scanning calorimetry, hydrogen-deuterium exchange, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry confirmed that the structure, stability, and metal content of mutant proteins were not significantly affected by lysine acetylation. Measured values of net charge should be used when correlating the biophysical properties of a specific ALS-variant SOD1 protein with its observed aggregation propensity or clinical phenotype.",Cu;Zn superoxide dismutase; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; SOD1; amyloid; protein aggregation; motor neuron disease

Thus, our understanding of the global virome and the virome of specific host species in particular is rapidly expanding. Identification of animal viruses is important for understanding animal disease, the origin and evolution of human viruses, as well as zoonotic reservoirs for emerging infections. Although the human hepacivirus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), was identified 25 years ago, its origin has remained elusive. In 2011, the first HCV homolog was reported in dogs but subsequent studies showed the virus to be widely distributed in horses. This indicated a wider hepacivirus host range and paved the way for identification of rodent, bat and non-human primate hepaciviruses. The equine non-primate hepacivirus (NPHV) remains the closest relative of HCV and is so far the best characterized. Identification and characterization of novel hepaciviruses may in addition lead to development of tractable animal models to study HCV persistence, immune responses and pathogenesis. This could be particular important, given the current shortage of immunocompetent models for robust HCV infection. Much remains to be learned on the novel hepaciviruses, including their association with disease, and thereby how relevant they will become as HCV model systems and for studies of animal disease. This review discusses how virome analysis led to identification of novel hepaci- and pegiviruses, their genetic relationship and characterization and the potential use of animal hepaciviruses as models to study hepaciviral infection, immunity and pathogenesis.

Our results define regions with enhanced flexibility assigned to distinct subunits within the overall assembly. To provide a structural context for our experimental data we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and observed conformational changes of the peripheral stalks reflecting their intrinsic flexibility. By isolating complexes at different phases of cell growth and manipulating nucleotides, metal ions and pH during isolation, we reveal differences that can be related to conformational changes in the Vo complex, triggered by ATP binding.

Identifying such inhibitors is difficult since many protein precursors of aggregation are partially folded or intrinsically disordered, ruling out structure-based design. Furthermore, inhibitors can act by a variety of mechanisms, including specific or non-specific binding, as well as colloidal inhibition. Here we report a high throughput method based on ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) that is capable of rapidly detecting small molecules that bind to amyloid precursors, identifying the interacting protein species, and defining the mode of inhibition. Using this method we have classified a variety of small molecules that are potential inhibitors of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) aggregation or amyloid-beta 1-40 (Aβ40) aggregation as either specific, non-specific, colloidal or non-interacting. We also demonstrate the ability of IMS-MS to screen for inhibitory small molecules in a 96-well plate format and use this to discover a new inhibitor of hIAPP amyloid assembly.",

NPM1 is the most frequently mutated gene in acute myeloid leukemia; mutations map to the C-terminal domain of the protein and cause its denaturation and aberrant cytoplasmic translocation. NPM1 C-terminal domain binds G-quadruplex regions at ribosomal DNA and at gene promoters, including the well characterized sequence from the nuclease-hypersensitive element III region of the c-MYC promoter. These activities are lost by the leukemic variant. Here we analyze the NPM1/G-quadruplex interaction, focusing on residues belonging to both the NPM1 terminal three-helix bundle and a lysine-rich unstructured tail, which has been shown to be necessary for high affinity recognition. We performed extended site-directed mutagenesis and measured binding rate constants through surface plasmon resonance analysis. These data, supported by molecular dynamics simulations, suggest that the unstructured tail plays a double role in the reaction mechanism. On the one hand, it facilitates the formation of an encounter complex through long range electrostatic interactions; on the other hand, it directly contacts the G-quadruplex scaffold through multiple and transient electrostatic interactions, significantly enlarging the contact surface.",Intrinsically Disordered Protein;Leukemia;Molecular Dynamics;Protein-DNA Interaction;Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR);Encounter Complex;Flanking Fuzziness

This review explores the neurobiological basis of the sigh and its relationship with psychology, physiology, and pathology. Sighs monitor changes in brain states, induce arousal, and reset breathing variability. These behavioral roles homeostatically regulate breathing stability under physiological and pathological conditions. Sighs evoked in hypoxia evoke arousal and thereby become critical for survival. Hypoarousal and failure to sigh have been associated with sudden infant death syndrome. Increased breathing irregularity may provoke excessive sighing and hyperarousal, a behavioral sequence that may play a role in panic disorders. Essential for generating sighs and breathing is the pre-Bötzinger complex. Modulatory and synaptic interactions within this local network and between networks located in the brainstem, cerebellum, cortex, hypothalamus, amygdala, and the periaqueductal gray may govern the relationships between physiology, psychology, and pathology. Unraveling these circuits will lead to a better understanding of how we balance emotions and how emotions become pathological.",anxiety;panic;arousal;cardiorespiratory;PAG;rhythm generation;SIDS;breathing;pre-Bötzinger complex

Recent structural and biochemical studies provide new insight into how cells control the actin capping activity of CP. Several molecules indirectly regulate CP by interacting with filament barbed ends and preventing binding of CP; others bind directly to CP and sterically block its interaction with an actin filament. A diverse and otherwise unrelated set of proteins contains a motif for CP regulation termed the “Capping Protein Interaction” (CPI) motif.

As each cell type expresses a distinct array of RBPs, the interpretation of regulatory information on a given RNA target is exceedingly dependent on the cell type. RBPs also control each other’s functions at many levels, including by mutual modulation of their binding activities on specific regulatory RNA elements.

Here, we showed that the Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) acted in a positive feedback loop to potentiate Ca2+ signaling downstream of the Tec kinase family member Itk. Using NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance), we mapped CaM binding to two loops adjacent to the lipid-binding pocket within the Itk pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The Itk PH domain bound synergistically to Ca2+/CaM and the lipid phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P3], such that binding to Ca2+/CaM enhanced the binding to PI(3,4,5)P3 and vice versa. Disruption of CaM binding attenuated Itk recruitment to the membrane and diminished release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, disruption of this feedback loop abrogated Itk-dependent production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17A (interleukin-17A) by CD4+ T cells. Additionally, we found that CaM associated with PH domains from other proteins, indicating that CaM may regulate other PH domain–containing proteins.",

In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans there are two types of cuticle: a well-studied collagenous cuticle lines the body, and a poorly-understood chitinous cuticle lines the pharynx. In the posterior end of the pharynx is the grinder, a tooth-like cuticular specialization that crushes food prior to transport to the intestine for digestion. We here show that the grinder increases in size only during the molt. To gain molecular insight into the structure of the grinder and pharyngeal cuticle, we performed a microarray analysis to identify mRNAs increased during the molt. We found strong transcriptional induction during the molt of 12 of 15 previously identified abu genes encoding Prion-like (P) glutamine (Q) and asparagine (N) rich PQN proteins, as well as 15 additional genes encoding closely related PQN proteins. abu/pqn genes, which we name the abu/pqn paralog group (APPG) genes, were expressed in pharyngeal cells and the proteins encoded by two APPG genes we tested localized to the pharyngeal cuticle. Deleting the APPG gene abu-14 caused abnormal pharyngeal cuticular structures and knocking down other APPG genes resulted in abnormal cuticular function. We propose that APPG proteins promote the assembly and function of a unique cuticular structure. The strong developmental regulation of the APPG genes raises the possibility that such genes would be identified in transcriptional profiling experiments in which the animals' developmental stage is not precisely staged.",C. elegans;molting;larvae;amyloid;cuticle;ABU/PQN;innate immunity;unfolded protein response

In the last several years, tremendous progress has been made in the understanding of HCV life cycle and in the development of small molecule compounds for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Nevertheless, the complete understanding of HCV assembly and particle release as well as the detailed characterization and structure of HCV particles are still missing. One of the most important events in the HCV assembly is the nucleocapsid formation that is driven by the core protein, which can oligomerize upon interaction with viral RNA, and is orchestrated by viral and host proteins. Despite a growing number of identified new factors involved in HCV assembly process, we do not know the three-dimensional structure of the HCV core protein or its topology in the nucleocapsid. Since the core protein contains a hydrophobic C-terminal domain responsible for the binding to cellular membranes, the assembly pathway of HCV virions might proceed via co-assembly at endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Recently, the new mechanisms involving viral proteins and host factors in HCV particle formation and egress have been described. The present review aims to summarize the advances in our understanding of the HCV assembly process with an emphasis of the core protein as a structural component of virus particles possessing the ability to interact with a variety of cellular components and being an attractive potential target for the development of a novel class of anti-HCV agents.",HCV;Core protein;HCV assembly;Nucleocapsid;HCV particles

In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the Pup-proteasome system (PPS) is important for virulence, yet its physiological role in non-pathogenic species has remained an enigma. We now report, using Mycobacterium smegmatis as a model organism, that the PPS is essential for survival under starvation. Upon nitrogen limitation, PPS activity is induced, leading to accelerated tagging and degradation of many cytoplasmic proteins. We suggest a model in which the PPS functions to recycle amino acids under nitrogen starvation, thereby enabling the cell to maintain basal metabolic activities. We also find that the PPS auto-regulates its own activity via pupylation and degradation of its components in a manner that promotes the oscillatory expression of PPS components. As such, the destructive activity of the PPS is carefully balanced to maintain cellular functions during starvation.",mycobacteria;nitrogen limitation;proteasome;proteolysis;pupylation

Leucine-rich amelogenin protein (LRAP) is a 59-residue splice variant of amelogenin and contains the N- and C-terminal charged regions of the full-length protein thought to control crystal growth. Although the quaternary structure of full-length amelogenin in solution has been well studied and can consist of self-assemblies of monomers called nanospheres, there is limited information on the quaternary structure of LRAP. Here, sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) were used to study the tertiary and quaternary structure of LRAP at various pH values, ionic strengths, and concentrations. We found that the monomer is the dominant species of phosphorylated LRAP (LRAP(+P)) over a range of solution conditions (pH 2.7 to 4.1, pH 4.5 to 8, 50 mmol/L(mM) to 200 mM NaCl, 0.065 to 2 mg/mL). The monomer is also the dominant species for unphosphorylated LRAP (LRAP(−P)) at pH 7.4 and for LRAP(+P) in the presence of 2.5 mM calcium at pH 7.4. LRAP aggregates in a narrow pH range near the isoelectric point of pH 4.1.

The C-terminal part of nsP2 possesses protease activity, whereas the N-terminal part exhibits NTPase and RNA triphosphatase activity and is proposed to have helicase activity. Bioinformatics analysis classified CHIKV nsP2 into helicase superfamily 1. However, the biochemical significance of a coexistence of two functionally unrelated modules in this single protein remains unknown. In this study, recombinant nsP2 demonstrated unwinding of double-stranded RNA in a 5′–3′ directionally biased manner and RNA strand annealing activity. Comparative analysis of NTPase and helicase activities of wild type nsP2 with enzymatic capabilities of different truncated or N-terminally extended variants of nsP2 revealed that the C-terminal part of the protein is indispensable for helicase functionality and presumably provides a platform for RNA binding, whereas the N-terminal-most region is apparently involved in obtaining a conformation of nsP2 that allows for its maximal enzymatic activities. The establishment of the protocols for the production of biochemically active CHIKV nsP2 and optimization of the parameters for helicase and NTPase assays are expected to provide the starting point for a further search of possibilities for therapeutic interventions to suppress alphaviral infections.",Enzymes;Positive-strand RNA Viruses;Protein Purification;RNA Helicase;Viral Replication;Chikungunya Virus;NTPase;RNA Annealing;SF1 Helicase;Alphavirus

The lipid bilayer represents the fundamental architecture of the cellular membrane with its shapes determined by the Helfrich curvature bending energy. However, the dynamics of bilayer shape transitions, especially their modulation by membrane proteins, and the resulting shape instabilities, are still not well understood. Here, we review in a unifying manner several theories that describe the fluctuations (i.e. undulations) of bilayer shapes as well as their local coupling with lipid or protein density variation. The coupling between local membrane curvature and lipid density gives rise to a ‘slipping mode’ in addition to the conventional ‘bending mode’ for damping the membrane fluctuation. This leads to a number of interesting experimental phenomena regarding bilayer shape dynamics. More importantly, curvature-inducing proteins can couple with membrane shape and eventually render the membrane unstable. A criterion for membrane shape instability is derived from a linear stability analysis. The instability criterion reemphasizes the importance of membrane tension in regulating the stability and dynamics of membrane geometry. Recent progresses in understanding the role of membrane tension in regulating dynamical cellular processes are also reviewed. Protein density is emphasized as a key factor in regulating membrane shape transitions: a threshold density of curvature coupling proteins is required for inducing membrane morphology transitions.",Membrane fluctuation;Interleaflet friction;Membrane tension;Curvature instability;Protein density;Membrane shape transition

Previous studies using PR-null mice have shown that PR plays an important role in female fertility, regulation of uterine growth, the uterine decidualization response, and proliferation as well as ductal side-branching and alveologenesis in the mammary gland. To study the role of PR phosphorylation in vivo, a mouse was engineered with homozygous replacement of PR with a PR serine-to-alanine mutation at amino acid 191. No overt phenotypes were observed in the mammary glands or uteri of PR S191A treated with progesterone (P4). In contrast, although PR S191A mice were fertile, litters were 19% smaller than wild type and the estrous cycle was lengthened slightly. Moreover, P4-dependent gene regulation in primary mammary epithelial cells (MECs) was altered in a gene-selective manner. MECs derived from wild type and PR S191A mice were grown in a three-dimensional culture. Both formed acinar structures that were morphologically similar, and proliferation was stimulated equally by P4. However, P4 induction of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand and calcitonin was selectively reduced in S191A cultures. These differences were confirmed in freshly isolated MECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the binding of S191A PR to some of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand enhancers and a calcitonin enhancer was substantially reduced. Thus, the elimination of a single phosphorylation site is sufficient to modulate PR activity in vivo. PR contains many phosphorylation sites, and the coordinate regulation of multiple sites is a potential mechanism for selective modulation of PR function.",

The adoption of such amyloid conformations seems to constitute a generic property of polypeptide chains. Therefore, during evolution, proteins have adopted negative design strategies to diminish their intrinsic propensity to aggregate, including enrichment of gatekeeper charged residues at the flanks of hydrophobic aggregation-prone segments. Wild type transthyretin (TTR) is responsible for senile systemic amyloidosis, and more than 100 mutations in the TTR gene are involved in familial amyloid polyneuropathy. The TTR 26–57 segment bears many of these aggressive amyloidogenic mutations as well as the binding site for heparin. We demonstrate here that Lys-35 acts as a gatekeeper residue in TTR, strongly decreasing its amyloidogenic potential. This protective effect is sequence-specific because Lys-48 does not affect TTR aggregation. Lys-35 is part of the TTR basic heparin-binding motif. This glycosaminoglycan blocks the protective effect of Lys-35, probably by neutralization of its side chain positive charge. A K35L mutation emulates this effect and results in the rapid self-assembly of the TTR 26–57 region into amyloid fibrils. This mutation does not affect the tetrameric protein stability, but it strongly increases its aggregation propensity. Overall, we illustrate how TTR is yet another amyloidogenic protein exploiting negative design to prevent its massive aggregation, and we show how blockage of conserved protective features by endogenous factors or mutations might result in increased disease susceptibility.",Amyloid;Heparin;Peptides;Protein Aggregation;Protein Misfolding;Aggregation Propensity;Gatekeeper Residue;Rational Mutation;Transthyretin

The regulation of this equilibrium plays a central role in maintaining the activity of these proteins in vitro and in vivo. Modulation of the oligomerization equilibrium of proteins by molecules that bind preferentially to a specific oligomeric state is emerging as a potential therapeutic strategy that can be applied to many biological systems such as cancer and viral infections. The target proteins for such compounds are diverse in structure and sequence, and may require different approaches for shifting their oligomerization equilibrium. The discovery of such oligomerization-modulating compounds is thus achieved based on existing structural knowledge about the specific target proteins, as well as on their interactions with partner proteins or with ligands. In silico design and combinatorial tools such as peptide arrays and phage display are also used for discovering compounds that modulate protein oligomerization.

In particular, accurate methods to computing one theoretical scattering profile from a given structure model are discussed, with a key focus on structure factor coarse-graining and hydration contribution. Methods for reconstructing topological structures from an experimental SAXS profile are currently under active development. We report on several modeling tools designed for conformation generation that make use of either atomic-level or coarse-grained representations. Furthermore, since large biomolecules can adopt multiple well-defined conformations, a traditional single-conformation SAXS analysis is inappropriate, so we also discuss recent methods that utilize the concept of ensemble optimization, weighing in on the SAXS contributions of a heterogeneous mixture of conformations. These tools will ultimately posit the usefulness of SAXS data beyond a simple space-filling approach by providing a reliable structural characterization of biomolecular complexes under physiological conditions.",Computing;protein;DNA;RNA;ensemble optimization

However, the severity of numerous side effects limits the frequency and duration of glucocorticoid treatments. Of the numerous approaches to control off-target responses to glucocorticoids, small molecules and pharmaceuticals offer several advantages. Here we describe a new, extended high-throughput screen in intact cells to identify small molecule modulators of dexamethasone-induced glucocorticoid receptor (GR) transcriptional activity. The novelty of this assay is that it monitors changes in both GR maximal activity (Amax) and EC50 (the position of the dexamethasone dose-response curve). Upon screening 1280 chemicals, 10 with the greatest changes in the absolute value of Amax or EC50 were selected for further examination. Qualitatively identical behaviors for 60% to 90% of the chemicals were observed in a completely different system, suggesting that other systems will be similarly affected by these chemicals. Additional analysis of the 10 chemicals in a recently described competition assay determined their kinetically defined mechanism and site of action. Some chemicals had similar mechanisms of action despite divergent effects on the level of the GR-induced product. These combined assays offer a straightforward method of identifying numerous new pharmaceuticals that can alter GR transactivation in ways that could be clinically useful.",

Polyadenylation consists of two steps, cleavage and poly(A) synthesis, and requires multiple cis elements in the pre-mRNA and a megadalton protein complex bearing the two essential enzymatic activities. While genetic and biochemical studies remain the major approaches in characterizing these factors, structural biology has emerged during the past decade to help understand the molecular assembly and mechanistic details of the process. With structural information about more proteins and higher-order complexes becoming available, we are coming closer to obtaining a structural blueprint of the polyadenylation machinery that explains both how this complex functions and how it is regulated and connected to other cellular processes.",

Upon contact with lipid bilayers, it is stabilized into a heterogeneous ensemble of structural states. These processes are associated with gains-of-function including catalysis of β-sheet rich amyloid formation, cell membrane penetration, loss of membrane integrity and cytotoxicity. These contribute to the dysfunction of β-cells, a central component in the pathology and treatment of diabetes. To gain mechanistic insight into these phenomena, a related series of substituted oligoquinolines were designed. These inhibitors are unique in that they have the capacity to affect both solution and phospholipid bilayer catalyzed IAPP self-assembly. Importantly, we show this activity is associated with the oligoquinoline’s capacity to irreversibly adopt a non-covalently fold. This suggests that compact foldamer scaffolds, such as oligoquinoline, are an important paradigm for conformational manipulation of disordered protein states.",

Combining knowledge of the location of the dimeric interface with molecular modeling and ion mobility data allows us to propose a low-resolution model for the full-length OmpA dimer. Our model of the dimer is in remarkable agreement with experimental ion mobility data, with none of the unfolding or collapse observed for full-length monomeric OmpA, implying that dimer formation stabilises the overall structure and prevents collapse of the flexible linker that connects the two domains.",

NMD substrates can be degraded by different routes that all require phosphorylated UPF1 (P-UPF1) as a starting point. The endonuclease SMG6, which cleaves mRNA near the PTC, is one of the three known NMD factors thought to be recruited to nonsense mRNAs via an interaction with P-UPF1, leading to eventual mRNA degradation. By artificial tethering of SMG6 and mutants thereof to a reporter mRNA combined with knockdowns of various NMD factors, we demonstrate that besides its endonucleolytic activity, SMG6 also requires UPF1 and SMG1 to reduce reporter mRNA levels. Using in vivo and in vitro approaches, we further document that SMG6 and the unique stalk region of the UPF1 helicase domain, along with a contribution from the SQ domain, form a novel interaction and we also show that this region of the UPF1 helicase domain is critical for SMG6 function and NMD. Our results show that this interaction is required for NMD and for the capability of tethered SMG6 to degrade its bound RNA, suggesting that it contributes to the intricate regulation of UPF1 and SMG6 enzymatic activities.",

Over-expression of c-Myc has been observed in, and directly contributes to, a variety of human cancers including those of the hematopoietic system, lung, prostate and colon. To become transcriptionally active, c-Myc must first dimerize with Max via its own bHLH-ZIP domain. A proven strategy towards the inhibition of c-Myc oncogenic activity is to interfere with the structural integrity of the c-Myc–Max heterodimer. The small-molecule 10074-G5 is an inhibitor of c-Myc–Max dimerization (IC50 = 146 μM) that operates by binding and stabilizing c-Myc in its monomeric form. Herein, we report on our on-going efforts to optimize the c-Myc–Max inhibitory activity of 10074-G5-related molecules in vitro and in cancer cells that over-express c-Myc. Specifically, we have identified a congener of 10074-G5, termed 3jc48-3, that is about five times as potent (IC50 = 34 μM) at inhibiting c-Myc–Max dimerization as the parent compound. In addition, 3jc48-3 exhibited an approximate two-fold selectivity for c-Myc–Max heterodimers over Max–Max dimers, suggesting that, like its predecessor, its mode of action is through binding c-Myc. 3jc48-3 inhibited the proliferation of c-Myc-over-expressing HL60 and Daudi cells with single-digit micromolar IC50 values by causing growth arrest at the G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation studies indicated that 3jc48-3 inhibits c-Myc–Max dimerization in cells, which was further substantiated by the specific silencing of a c-Myc-driven luciferase reporter gene. Finally, unlike previously described 10074-G5 analogues, which are rapidly released and/or metabolized by cells following their uptake, 3jc48-3’s intracellular half-life was >17 h. Collectively, these data demonstrate 3jc48-3 to be one of the most potent cellularly active c-Myc inhibitors reported to date.",10074-G5;JY-3-094;c-Myc;Max;protein–protein interaction

Nucleotides such as adenosine triphosphate and adenosine diphosphate are release from injured and necrotic cells and hydrolyzed to adenosine monophosphate and adenosine by the concerted action of the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73. Accumulating evidence suggest that purinergic signaling is involved in the inflammatory response that accompanies acute rejection and chronic allograft dysfunction. Modification of the purinergic pathway has been shown to alter graft survival in a number of solid organ transplant models and the response to ischemia–reperfusion injury (IRI). Furthermore, the purinergic pathway is intrinsically involved in B and T cell biology and function. Although T cells have traditionally been considered the orchestrators of acute allograft rejection, a role for B cells in chronic allograft loss is being increasingly appreciated. This review focuses on the role of the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73 and adenosine signaling in solid organ transplantation including the effects on IRI and T and B cell biology.",adenosine;CD73;CD39;Treg;B cells

These residues belong to a loop-helix-loop motif at the C-terminal end of AC, which is located at the interface between CaM and the AC catalytic loop. In the present study, we conducted the in silico and in vitro characterization of three AC variants, where one (Asn347; ACm1A), two (Arg338 and Asp360; ACm2A), or three residues (Arg338, Asn347, and Asp360; ACm3A) were substituted with Ala. Biochemical studies showed that the affinities of ACm1A and ACm2A for CaM were not affected significantly, whereas that of ACm3A was reduced dramatically. To understand the effects of these modifications, molecular dynamics simulations were performed based on the modified proteins. The molecular dynamics trajectories recorded for the ACm3A·C-CaM complex showed that the calcium-binding loops of C-CaM exhibited large fluctuations, which could be related to the weakened interaction between ACm3A and its activator. Overall, our results suggest that the loop-helix-loop motif at the C-terminal end of AC is crucial during CaM binding for stabilizing the AC catalytic loop in an active configuration.",Bioinformatics;Calcium;Molecular Modeling;Mutagenesis;Virulence Factor

The murine γHV68 provides a tractable in vivo model for understanding general features of these important human pathogens. Bcl-XL, a cellular Bcl-2 homolog, and the murine γHV68 Bcl-2 homolog, M11, both bind to a BH3 domain within the key autophagy effector Beclin 1 with comparable affinities, resulting in the down-regulation of Beclin 1-mediated autophagy. Despite this similarity, differences in residues lining the binding site of M11 and Bcl-XL dictate varying affinities for the different BH3 domain-containing proteins. Here we delineate Beclin 1 differential specificity determinants for binding to M11 or Bcl-XL by quantifying autophagy levels in cells expressing different Beclin 1 mutants and either M11 or Bcl-XL, and we show that a G120E/D121A Beclin 1 mutant selectively prevents down-regulation of Beclin 1-mediated autophagy by Bcl-XL, but not by M11. We use isothermal titration calorimetry to identify a Beclin 1 BH3 domain-derived peptide that selectively binds to M11, but not to Bcl-XL. The x-ray crystal structure of this peptide bound to M11 reveals the mechanism by which the M11 BH3 domain-binding groove accommodates this M11-specific peptide.

Short sequence motifs termed homology boxes A and B, which comprise their minimal transactivation domains (TADs), are conserved between C/EBP activators and are necessary for specific p300/CBP binding. A possible mode of interaction between C/EBP TADs and the p300 Taz2 domain was implied by the crystal structure of a chimeric protein composed of residues 1723–1818 of p300 Taz2 and residues 37–61 of C/EBP∊. The segment corresponding to the C/EBP∊ TAD forms two orthogonally disposed helices connected by a short linker and interacts with the core structure of Taz2 from a symmetry-related molecule. It is proposed that other members of the C/EBP family interact with the Taz2 domain in the same manner.

Knockdown of other 14‐3‐3 isoforms does not significantly affect NFAT5 activity. 14‐3‐3‐β and/or 14‐3‐3‐ε do not act by affecting the nuclear localization of NFAT5, but by at least two other mechanisms: (1) 14‐3‐3‐β and 14‐3‐3‐ε increase protein abundance of NFAT5 and (2) they increase NFAT5 transactivating activity. When NaCl is elevated, knockdown of 14‐3‐3‐β and/or 14‐3‐3‐ε reduces the protein abundance of NFAT5, as measured by Western blot, without affecting the level of NFAT5 mRNA, and the knockdown also decreases NFAT5 transactivating activity, as measured by luciferase reporter. The 14‐3‐3s increase NFAT5 protein, not by increasing its translation, but by decreasing the rate at which it is degraded, as measured by cycloheximide chase.

colanic acid and biofilm regulator (McbR, also
known as YncC) is the protein product of a highly induced gene in
early Escherichia coli biofilm development
and has been regarded as an attractive target for blocking biofilm
formation. This protein acts as a repressor for genes involved in
exopolysaccharide production and an activator for genes involved in
stress response. To better understand the role of McbR in governing
the switch from exponential growth to the biofilm state, we determined
the crystal structure of McbR to 2.1 Å. The structure reveals
McbR to be a member of the FadR C-terminal domain (FCD) family of
the GntR superfamily of transcriptional regulators (this family was
named after the first identified member, GntR, a transcriptional repressor
of the gluconate operon of Bacillus subtilis). Previous to this study, only six of the predicted 2800 members
of this family had been structurally characterized. Here, we identify
the residues that constitute the McbR effector and DNA binding sites.
In addition, comparison of McbR with other members of the FCD domain
family shows that this family of proteins adopts highly distinct oligomerization
interfaces, which has implications for DNA binding and regulation.",

In a previous characterization of mutant alleles of the Drosophila melanogaster Hox gene, Sex combs reduced (Scr), we identified the missense, antimorphic allele Scr14, which is a Ser10-to-Leu change in the N-terminally located, bilateran-specific octapeptide motif. Here we propose that the cause of Scr14 antimorphy is the acquisition of a leucine zipper oligomerization motif spanning the octapeptide motif and adjacently located protostome-specific LASCY motif. Analysis of the primary and predicted secondary structures of the SCR N-terminus suggests that while the SCR+ encodes a short, α-helical region containing one putative heptad repeat, the same region in SCR14 encodes a longer, α-helical region containing two putative heptad repeats. In addition, in vitro cross-linking assays demonstrated strong oligomerization of SCR14 but not SCR+. For in vivo sex comb formation, we observed reciprocal inhibition of endogenous SCR+ and SCR14 activity by ectopic expression of truncated SCR14 and SCR+ peptides, respectively. The acquisition of an oligomerization domain in SCR14 presents a novel mechanism of antimorphy relative to the dominant negative mechanism, which maintains oligomerization between the wild-type and mutant protein subunits.",Homeotic selector genes;body patterning;Sex combs reduced;evolutionarily conserved protein motifs;leucine zipper;interaction interface;antimorph;dominant negative

The aggregation reaction is characterized by conformational conversion of the repeat domain, which partially adopts a cross-β-structure in the resulting amyloid-like fibrils. Here, we report the selection and characterization of an engineered binding protein, β-wrapin TP4, targeting the Tau repeat domain. TP4 was obtained by phage display using the four-repeat Tau construct K18ΔK280 as a target. TP4 binds K18ΔK280 as well as the longest isoform of human Tau, hTau40, with nanomolar affinity. NMR spectroscopy identified two alternative TP4-binding sites in the four-repeat domain, with each including two hexapeptide motifs with high β-sheet propensity. Both binding sites contain the aggregation-determining PHF6 hexapeptide within repeat 3. In addition, one binding site includes the PHF6* hexapeptide within repeat 2, whereas the other includes the corresponding hexapeptide Tau(337–342) within repeat 4, denoted PHF6**. Comparison of TP4-binding with Tau aggregation reveals that the same regions of Tau are involved in both processes. TP4 inhibits Tau aggregation at substoichiometric concentration, demonstrating that it interferes with aggregation nucleation.

The understanding of protein structure, function, dynamics and transport is one of most challenging tasks in biological science. In the present work, persistent homology is, for the first time, introduced for extracting molecular topological fingerprints (MTFs) based on the persistence of molecular topological invariants. MTFs are utilized for protein characterization, identification and classification. The method of slicing is proposed to track the geometric origin of protein topological invariants. Both all-atom and coarse-grained representations of MTFs are constructed. A new cutoff-like filtration is proposed to shed light on the optimal cutoff distance in elastic network models. Based on the correlation between protein compactness, rigidity and connectivity, we propose an accumulated bar length generated from persistent topological invariants for the quantitative modeling of protein flexibility. To this end, a correlation matrix based filtration is developed. This approach gives rise to an accurate prediction of the optimal characteristic distance used in protein B-factor analysis. Finally, MTFs are employed to characterize protein topological evolution during protein folding and quantitatively predict the protein folding stability. An excellent consistence between our persistent homology prediction and molecular dynamics simulation is found.

Existing positive gating modulators like EBIO, NS309, or SKA-31 activate both KCa2 and KCa3.1 channels with similar potency or, as in the case of CyPPA and NS13001, selectively activate KCa2.2 and KCa2.3 channels. We performed a structure-activity relationship (SAR) study with the aim of optimizing the benzothiazole pharmacophore of SKA-31 toward KCa3.1 selectivity. We identified SKA-111 (5-methylnaphtho[1,2-d]thiazol-2-amine), which displays 123-fold selectivity for KCa3.1 (EC50 111 ± 27 nM) over KCa2.3 (EC50 13.7 ± 6.9 μM), and SKA-121 (5-methylnaphtho[2,1-d]oxazol-2-amine), which displays 41-fold selectivity for KCa3.1 (EC50 109 nM ± 14 nM) over KCa2.3 (EC50 4.4 ± 1.6 μM). Both compounds are 200- to 400-fold selective over representative KV (KV1.3, KV2.1, KV3.1, and KV11.1), NaV (NaV1.2, NaV1.4, NaV1.5, and NaV1.7), as well as CaV1.2 channels. SKA-121 is a typical positive-gating modulator and shifts the calcium-concentration response curve of KCa3.1 to the left. In blood pressure telemetry experiments, SKA-121 (100 mg/kg i.p.) significantly lowered mean arterial blood pressure in normotensive and hypertensive wild-type but not in KCa3.1−/− mice. SKA-111, which was found in pharmacokinetic experiments to have a much longer half-life and to be much more brain penetrant than SKA-121, not only lowered blood pressure but also drastically reduced heart rate, presumably through cardiac and neuronal KCa2 activation when dosed at 100 mg/kg. In conclusion, with SKA-121, we generated a KCa3.1-specific positive gating modulator suitable for further exploring the therapeutical potential of KCa3.1 activation.",

The α-ring is a heteroheptameric ring of subunits α1 to α7 and acts as a gate that restricts entry of substrate proteins into the catalytic cavity formed by the two abutting β-rings. The 31-kDa proteasome inhibitor (PI31) was originally identified as a protein that binds to the CP and inhibits CP activity in vitro, but accumulating evidence indicates that PI31 is required for physiological proteasome activity. To clarify the in vivo role of PI31, we examined the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PI31 ortholog Fub1. Fub1 was essential in a situation where the CP assembly chaperone Pba4 was deleted. The lethality of Δfub1 Δpba4 was suppressed by deletion of the N terminus of α7 (α7ΔN), which led to the partial activation of the CP. However, deletion of the N terminus of α3, which activates the CP more efficiently than α7ΔN by gate opening, did not suppress Δfub1 Δpba4 lethality. These results suggest that the α7 N terminus has a role in CP activation different from that of the α3 N terminus and that the role of Fub1 antagonizes a specific function of the α7 N terminus.",

A specific physical interaction exists between the Parkinson disease-related protein α-synuclein (α-syn) and GCase both in solution and on the lipid membrane, resulting in efficient enzyme inhibition. Here, neutron reflectometry was employed as a first direct structural characterization of GCase and α-syn·GCase complex on a sparsely-tethered lipid bilayer, revealing the orientation of the membrane-bound GCase. GCase binds to and partially inserts into the bilayer with its active site most likely lying just above the membrane-water interface. The interaction was further characterized by intrinsic Trp fluorescence, circular dichroism, and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. Both Trp fluorescence and neutron reflectometry results suggest a rearrangement of loops surrounding the catalytic site, where they extend into the hydrocarbon chain region of the outer leaflet. Taking advantage of contrasting neutron scattering length densities, the use of deuterated α-syn versus protiated GCase showed a large change in the membrane-bound structure of α-syn in the complex. We propose a model of α-syn·GCase on the membrane, providing structural insights into inhibition of GCase by α-syn. The interaction displaces GCase away from the membrane, possibly impeding substrate access and perturbing the active site. GCase greatly alters membrane-bound α-syn, moving helical residues away from the bilayer, which could impact the degradation of α-syn in the lysosome where these two proteins interact.",Gaucher Disease;Membrane Bilayer;Parkinson Disease;Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR);Tryptophan;Protein-Lipid Interaction

a spontaneous association of disordered
components into an ordered supramolecular structure, is responsible
for the formation of complex biological systems and is becoming increasingly
important in material sciences striving to develop novel biomaterials
with a great diversity of biochemical and physical properties. Very
little is known about the mechanisms underlying the emergence of ordered
structures from disordered components. Recently, a remarkable diversity
of polyhedra that self-assemble through excluded volume interactions
at high packing fractions into entropic crystals with various degrees
of crystalline order was reported.1 At
the opposite spectrum of a high packing fraction is protein aggregation,
which typically occurs in vivo at nanomolar and in vitro at micromolar
concentrations and must be consequently facilitated by attractive
intermolecular interactions. Aberrant protein aggregation is at the
core of many age-triggered diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s,
and Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, type
II diabetes, systemic amyloidoses, and others.2 These amyloid proteins do not share any obvious aspects of the primary
structure yet they self-assemble into cytotoxic low-molecular weight
oligomers and form fibrils with a common cross-β structure.3 Inherent toxicity of amyloid assemblies that
cause the disease implies a common assembly mechanism;4 however, assembly pathways are not well understood.5 Here, we introduce a minimal model of self-assembly
that unifies common features of protein amyloidogenesis and can be
meaningfully mapped onto sequences of amyloid proteins. Because the
model is not protein specific, the model predictions extend to self-assembly
systems beyond the aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins.",

Hence, the technique has not achieved widespread use within the NMR community. SARA offers users a selection of analysis protocols spanning those presented in the literature thus far, with modifications permitting a more general application to crowded spectra such as those of proteins. We discuss the advantages and limitations of each fitting method and suggest a protocol combining the strengths of each procedure to achieve optimal results.

MYC has an N-terminal transcription activation domain (TAD) that is also required for cell transformation. Various MYC TAD-interacting coactivators have been identified, including the transcription/transformation-associated protein (TRRAP), a subunit of different histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes such as the human “SPT3-TAF9-GCN5 Acetyltransferase” (STAGA) complex involved in MYC transactivation of the TERT gene. However, it remains unclear whether TRRAP and/or other subunits are directly contacted by MYC within these macromolecular complexes. Here, we characterize the interactions of MYC TAD with the STAGA complex. By protein crosslinking we identify both TRRAP and the GCN5 acetyltransferase as MYC TAD-interacting subunits within native STAGA. We show that purified GCN5 binds to an N-terminal sub-domain of MYC TAD (residues 21-108) and that the interaction of GCN5 and STAGA with this sub-domain is dependent on two related sequence motifs: M2 within the conserved MYC homology box I (MBI), and M3 located between residues 100-106. Interestingly, specific substitutions within the M2/3 motifs that only moderately reduce the intracellular MYC-STAGA interaction and do not influence dimerization of MYC with its DNA-binding partner MAX, strongly inhibit MYC acetylation by GCN5 and reduce MYC binding and transactivation of the GCN5-dependent TERT promoter in vivo. Hence, we propose that MYC associates with STAGA through extended interactions of the TAD with both TRRAP and GCN5 and that the TAD-GCN5 interaction is important for MYC acetylation and MYC binding to certain chromatin loci.",Chromatin;Coactivators;Histone acetyltransferase complexes;MYC oncoprotein;Protein-protein interactions;Transcription

It is predominantly associated with axonal microtubules and present at lower level in dendrites where it is engaged in signaling functions. Post-translational modifications of tau and its interaction with several proteins play an important regulatory role in the physiology of tau. As a consequence of abnormal modifications and expression, tau is redistributed from neuronal processes to the soma and forms toxic oligomers or aggregated deposits. The accumulation of tau protein is increasingly recognized as the neuropathological hallmark of a number of dementia disorders known as tauopathies. Dysfunction of tau protein may contribute to collapse of cytoskeleton, thereby causing improper anterograde and retrograde movement of motor proteins and their cargos on microtubules.

The major component of these aggregates is α-synuclein, a natively unfolded protein, which may undergo dramatic structural changes resulting in the formation of β-sheet rich assemblies. In vitro studies have shown that recombinant α-synuclein protein may polymerize into amyloidogenic fibrils resembling those found in LBs.

Noticing the very close apposition of a compacted lumenal protein load and a cytosol-oriented ‘bristle’ coat on opposite faces of striking membrane invaginations, it was astutely reasoned that the bulbous plasmalemma structures ferry macromolecules into the cell interior in a highly selective manner. While it was soon clear clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a rapid activity (Brown and Goldstein, 1976), and is importantly involved in many fundamental cellular processes (McMahon and Boucrot, 2011; Brodsky, 2012; Kirchhausen et al., 2014), the regularity of the static coated structures in micrograph views masks the true underlying molecular dynamics and complexity. It is also challenging to identify the very earliest stages of clathrin coat assembly in thin sections because of the restricted size, ill-defined morphological features, and a lack of prominent membrane curvature. With the recent live-cell clarification of the linked temporal steps that define clathrin-coated structure initiation, growth, invagination and scission (Kaksonen et al., 2003; Taylor et al., 2011), it is clear that a large number of gene products are involved. The choreographed arrival and departure of these numerous proteins matches well their defined biochemical activities and the morphological progression of the bud (Taylor et al., 2011). Yet, what exactly defines a restricted plasma membrane zone that is destined to become a clathrin-coated bud remains elusive. In this regard, the clathrin coats at the cell surface are distinct from many other intracellular cargo sorting coats in that the selected assembly site is not demarcated by deposition of a GTP-bound small GTPase (Ren et al., 2013). The lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) is required for clathrin assembly (Boucrot et al., 2006; Zoncu et al., 2007; Nunez et al., 2011), but this phosphoinositide is broadly distributed over the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Ordered polymerization of a clathrin patch in fact appears to be a variable and probabilistic process (Ehrlich et al., 2004; Taylor et al., 2011; Cocucci et al., 2012; Brach et al., 2014). The nucleation stage displays the widest temporal variation and likely involves the largest number of protein cofactors (Taylor et al., 2011). While the principal heterotetameric cargo-selective adaptor, designated AP-2, is certainly important (Mitsunari et al., 2005; Cocucci et al., 2012; Aguet et al., 2013), its initial occurrence at inchoate bud sites is paralleled by a sizable suite of early-arriving pioneers, including eps15, intersectin, epsin, Fcho1 and Fcho2, CALM (Taylor et al., 2011) and Necap 1 (Ritter et al., 2013). The Fcho family (Fer/Cip4 homology only proteins), collectively termed the muniscins (Reider et al., 2009), is posited to act as internalization site founders on the basis of the biochemical properties of the proteins and the endocytic consequences of RNAi-mediated transcript silencing (Henne et al., 2010). Here we show that munsicins are indeed consequential endocytic pioneers, but that clathrin-mediated endocytosis still persists in their absence (Uezu et al., 2011; Mulkearns and Cooper, 2012; Mayers et al., 2013; Brach et al., 2014). We delineate a key biochemical aspect of the early operation of these endocytic proteins that regulates the rate and extent of clathrin-lattice fabrication at the cell surface.",E. coli;human

The body wall muscle of C. elegans is obliquely striated muscle with highly organized sarcomeric assembly of actin, myosin, and other accessary proteins. Genetic and molecular biological studies in C. elegans have identified a number of genes encoding structural and regulatory components for the muscle contractile apparatuses, and many of them have counterparts in mammalian cardiac and skeletal muscles or striated muscles in other invertebrates. Applicability of genetics, cell biology, and biochemistry has made C. elegans an excellent system to study mechanisms of muscle contractility and assembly and maintenance of myofibrils. This review focuses on the regulatory mechanisms of structure and function of actin filaments in the C. elegans body wall muscle. Sarcomeric actin filaments in C. elegans muscle are associated with the troponin-tropomyosin system that regulates the actin-myosin interaction. Proteins that bind to the side and ends of actin filaments support ordered assembly of thin filaments. Furthermore, regulators of actin dynamics play important roles in initial assembly, growth, and maintenance of sarcomeres. The knowledge acquired in C. elegans can serve as bases to understand the basic mechanisms of muscle structure and function.",

Within these dynamic motifs, microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are frequently under load, but how force modulates these proteins’ function is poorly understood. Here, we combine optical-trapping with TIRF-based microscopy to measure the force-dependence of microtubule interaction for three non-motor MAPs (NuMA, PRC1, and EB1) required for cell division. We find that frictional forces increase non-linearly with MAP velocity across microtubules and depend on filament polarity, with NuMA’s friction being lower when moving towards minus-ends, EB1’s lower towards plus-ends, and PRC1 exhibiting no directional preference. Mathematical models predict, and experiments confirm, that MAPs with asymmetric friction can move directionally within active microtubule pairs they crosslink. Our findings reveal how non-motor MAPs can generate frictional resistance in dynamic cytoskeletal networks via micromechanical adaptations whose anisotropy may be optimized for MAP localization and function within cellular structures.",

In this study, we demonstrated that the strength and nature of the non-specific electrostatic interactions, which govern the search dynamics of DBPs, are strongly correlated with the conformation of the DNA. We tuned two structural parameters, namely curvature and the extent of helical twisting in circular DNA. These two factors are mutually independent of each other and can modulate the electrostatic potential through changing the geometry of the circular DNA conformation. The search dynamics for DBPs on circular DNA is therefore markedly different compared with linear B-DNA. Our results suggest that, for a given DBP, the rotation-coupled sliding dynamics is precluded in highly curved DNA (as well as for over-twisted DNA) because of the large electrostatic energy barrier between the inside and outside of the DNA molecule. Under such circumstances, proteins prefer to hop in order to explore interior DNA sites. The change in the balance between sliding and hopping propensities as a function of DNA curvature or twisting may result in different search efficiency and speed.",

In the MIA pathway, Mia40, a thiol oxidoreductase with a CPC motif at its active site, oxidizes newly imported substrate proteins. Erv1 a FAD-dependent thiol oxidase, in turn reoxidizes Mia40 via its N-terminal Cys30–Cys33 shuttle disulfide. However, it is unclear how the two shuttle cysteine residues of Erv1 relay electrons from the Mia40 CPC motif to the Erv1 active-site Cys130–Cys133 disulfide. In the present study, using yeast genetic approaches we showed that both shuttle cysteine residues of Erv1 are required for cell growth. In organelle and in vitro studies confirmed that both shuttle cysteine residues were indeed required for import of MIA pathway substrates and Erv1 enzyme function to oxidize Mia40. Furthermore, our results revealed that the two shuttle cysteine residues of Erv1 are functionally distinct. Although Cys33 is essential for forming the intermediate disulfide Cys33–Cys130′ and transferring electrons to the redox active-site directly, Cys30 plays two important roles: (i) dominantly interacts and receives electrons from the Mia40 CPC motif; and (ii) resolves the Erv1 Cys33–Cys130 intermediate disulfide. Taken together, we conclude that both shuttle cysteine residues are required for Erv1 function, and play complementary, but distinct, roles to ensure rapid turnover of active Erv1.",CXXC motif;mitochondrial import;mitochondrial import and assembly pathway (MIA pathway);thiol oxidase

Mutations in MAVS and ASC that disrupt their prion activities in yeast also abrogate their ability to signal in mammalian cells. Furthermore, fibers of recombinant PYRIN can convert ASC into functional polymers capable of activating caspase-1.

The mechanisms that are involved in sucrose accumulation in sugarcane are not well understood, and little is known with regard to factors that control the extent of sucrose storage in the stalks. UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGPase; EC 2.7.7.9) is an enzyme that produces UDP-glucose, a key precursor for sucrose metabolism and cell wall biosynthesis. The objective of this work was to gain insights into the ScUGPase-1 expression pattern and regulatory mechanisms that control protein activity. ScUGPase-1 expression was negatively correlated with the sucrose content in the internodes during development, and only slight differences in the expression patterns were observed between two cultivars that differ in sucrose content. The intracellular localization of ScUGPase-1 indicated partial membrane association of this soluble protein in both the leaves and internodes. Using a phospho-specific antibody, we observed that ScUGPase-1 was phosphorylated in vivo at the Ser-419 site in the soluble and membrane fractions from the leaves but not from the internodes. The purified recombinant enzyme was kinetically characterized in the direction of UDP-glucose formation, and the enzyme activity was affected by redox modification. Preincubation with H2O2 strongly inhibited this activity, which could be reversed by DTT.

Many multi-subunit protein complexes have been found to regulate chromatin through the modification of histone residues. One such complex is the MOF histone acetyltransferase-containing NSL complex. While the composition of the human and Drosophila NSL complexes has been determined and the functions of these complexes investigated, the existence of an equivalent complex in nematodes such as Caenorhabditis elegans has not yet been explored. Here we summarise evidence, from our own work and that of others, that homologues of NSL complex components are found in C. elegans. We review data suggesting that nematode proteins SUMV-1 and SUMV-2 are homologous to NSL2 and NSL3, respectively, and that SUMV-1 and SUMV-2 may form a complex with MYS-2, the worm homolog of MOF. We propose that these interactions suggest the existence of a nematode NSL-like complex and discuss the roles of this putative NSL complex in worms as well as exploring the possibility of crosstalk between NSL and COMPASS complexes via components that are common to both. We present the groundwork from which a full characterization of a nematode NSL complex may begin.",chromatin;histone acetyltransferase;MOF;NSL;synMuv;vulval development

Recent evidence suggests that blunted Cav-1/endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) interaction, which occurs specifically in vascular endothelial cells, is responsible for the multiple phenotypes observed in Cav-1-null animals. Under basal conditions, Cav-1 binds eNOS and inhibits nitric oxide (NO) production via the Cav-1 scaffolding domain (CAV; amino acids 82–101). Although we have recently shown that CAV residue Phe-92 is responsible for eNOS inhibition, the “inactive” F92A Cav-1 mutant unexpectedly retains its eNOS binding ability and can increase NO release, indicating the presence of a distinct eNOS binding domain within CAV. Herein, we identified and characterized a small 10-amino acid CAV subsequence (90–99) that accounted for the majority of eNOS association with Cav-1 (Kd = 49 nm), and computer modeling of CAV(90–99) docking to eNOS provides a rationale for the mechanism of eNOS inhibition by Phe-92. Finally, using gene silencing and reconstituted cell systems, we show that intracellular delivery of a F92A CAV(90–99) peptide can promote NO bioavailability in eNOS- and Cav-1-dependent fashions. To our knowledge, these data provide the first detailed analysis of Cav-1 binding to one of its most significant client proteins, eNOS.",Caveolae;Caveolin;Endothelium;Nitric Oxide;Nitric-oxide Synthase

This advantage in bone strength relies mainly on greater cortical bone expansion during pubertal peak bone mass acquisition and superior skeletal maintenance during aging. During both these phases, estrogens acting via estrogen receptor-α in osteoblast lineage cells are crucial for male cortical and trabecular bone, as evident from conditional genetic mouse models, epidemiological studies, rare genetic conditions, genome-wide meta-analyses, and recent interventional trials. Genetic mouse models have also demonstrated a direct role for androgens independent of aromatization on trabecular bone via the androgen receptor in osteoblasts and osteocytes, although the target cell for their key effects on periosteal bone formation remains elusive. Low serum estradiol predicts incident fractures, but the highest risk occurs in men with additionally low T and high SHBG. Still, the possible clinical utility of serum sex steroids for fracture prediction is unknown. It is likely that sex steroid actions on male bone metabolism rely also on extraskeletal mechanisms and cross talk with other signaling pathways. We propose that estrogens influence fracture risk in aging men via direct effects on bone, whereas androgens exert an additional antifracture effect mainly via extraskeletal parameters such as muscle mass and propensity to fall. Given the demographic trends of increased longevity and consequent rise of osteoporosis, an increased understanding of how sex steroids influence male bone health remains a high research priority.",

Casein kinase 1ϵ (CK1ϵ) was identified as the major kinase responsible for Wnt-induced Dvl3 phosphorylation. Currently it is not clear which Dvl residues are phosphorylated and what is the consequence of individual phosphorylation events. In the present study we employed mass spectrometry to analyze in a comprehensive way the phosphorylation of human Dvl3 induced by CK1ϵ. Our analysis revealed >50 phosphorylation sites on Dvl3; only a minority of these sites was found dynamically induced after co-expression of CK1ϵ, and surprisingly, phosphorylation of one cluster of modified residues was down-regulated. Dynamically phosphorylated sites were analyzed functionally. Mutations within PDZ domain (S280A and S311A) reduced the ability of Dvl3 to activate TCF/LEF (T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor)-driven transcription and induce secondary axis in Xenopus embryos. In contrast, mutations of clustered Ser/Thr in the Dvl3 C terminus prevented ability of CK1ϵ to induce electrophoretic mobility shift of Dvl3 and its even subcellular localization. Surprisingly, mobility shift and subcellular localization changes induced by Fzd5, a Wnt receptor, were in all these mutants indistinguishable from wild type Dvl3. In summary, our data on the molecular level (i) support previous the assumption that CK1ϵ acts via phosphorylation of distinct residues as the activator as well as the shut-off signal of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and (ii) suggest that CK1ϵ acts on Dvl via different mechanism than Fzd5.",Cell Signaling;Mass Spectrometry (MS);Phosphorylation;Post-translational Modification (PTM);Wnt Pathway;Casein Kinase 1ϵ;Dishevelled-3;Frizzled5

Here, we solved the structure of the N2N3 domains containing the Fg-binding site of FnBPA in the apo form and in complex with a Fg peptide. The Fg binding mechanism is similar to that of homologous bacterial proteins but without the requirement for “latch” strand residues. We show that the Fg-binding sites and the most N-terminal Fn-binding sites are nonoverlapping but in close proximity. Although Fg and a subdomain of Fn can form a ternary complex on an FnBPA protein construct containing a Fg-binding site and single Fn-binding site, binding of intact Fn appears to inhibit Fg binding, suggesting steric regulation.

It consists of the core particle, which catalyzes the proteolysis of substrates into small peptides, and the regulatory particle, which ensures specificity for a broad range of substrates. The heart of the regulatory particle is an AAA-ATPase unfoldase, which is surrounded by non-ATPase subunits enabling substrate recognition and processing. Cryo-EM-based studies revealed the molecular architecture of the 26S proteasome and its conformational rearrangements, providing insights into substrate recognition, commitment, deubiquitylation and unfolding. The cytosol proteasomal degradation of polyubiquitylated substrates is tuned by various associating cofactors, including deubiquitylating enzymes, ubiquitin ligases, shuttling ubiquitin receptors and the AAA-ATPase Cdc48/p97. Cdc48/p97 and its cofactors function upstream of the 26S proteasome, and their modular organization exhibits some striking analogies to the regulatory particle. In archaea PAN, the closest regulatory particle homolog and Cdc48 even have overlapping functions, underscoring their intricate relationship. Here, we review recent insights into the structure and dynamics of the 26S proteasome and its associated machinery, as well as our current structural knowledge on the Cdc48/p97 and its cofactors that function in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS).",AAA-ATPases;26S proteasome;Cdc48;p97;unfoldase;segregase;cryo-EM

They are active materials that can detect mechanical stimulation by the activation of mechanosensitive signaling pathways, and respond to physical cues through cytoskeletal re-organization and force generation. Genetic mutations and pathogens that disrupt the cytoskeletal architecture can result in changes to cell mechanical properties such as elasticity, adhesiveness, and viscosity. On the other hand, perturbations to the mechanical environment can affect cell behavior. These transformations are often a hallmark and symptom of a variety of pathologies. Consequently, there are now a myriad of experimental techniques and theoretical models adapted from soft matter physics and mechanical engineering to characterize cell mechanical properties. Interdisciplinary research combining modern molecular biology with advanced cell mechanical characterization techniques now paves the way for furthering our fundamental understanding of cell mechanics and its role in development, physiology, and disease.

Our data offer specific single-base resolution fingerprints for most TFs studied and indicate that NAC DNA-binding specificities might be predicted from their DNA-binding domain's sequence. The developed methodology, including the application of complementary functional genomics filters, makes it possible to translate, for each TF, protein binding microarray data into a set of high-quality target genes. With this approach, we confirm NAC target genes reported from independent in vivo analyses.

The major detectable Lys modification was found to be methylation, which appeared in the form of mono- and di-methyl Lys residues distributed among at least eleven sites. Unlike tau phosphorylation sites, the frequency of Lys methylation was highest in the microtubule binding repeat region that mediates both microtubule binding and homotypic interactions. When purified recombinant human tau was modified in vitro through reductive methylation, its ability to promote tubulin polymerization was retained, whereas its aggregation propensity was greatly attenuated at both nucleation and extension steps. These data establish Lys methylation as part of the normal tau post-translational modification signature in human brain, and suggest that it can function in part to protect against pathological tau aggregation.",Tau protein;aggregation;post-translational modification;methylation;microtubule;Alzheimer’s disease;mass spectrometry

Topoisomerases are central regulators of DNA supercoiling commonly thought to act independently in the recognition and modulation of chromosome superstructure; however, recent evidence has indicated that cells tightly regulate topoisomerase activity to support chromosome dynamics, transcriptional response, and replicative events. How topoisomerase control is executed and linked to the internal status of a cell is poorly understood. To investigate these connections, we determined the structure of Escherichia coli gyrase, a type IIA topoisomerase bound to YacG, a recently identified chromosomally encoded inhibitor protein. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that YacG is frequently associated with coenzyme A (CoA) production enzymes, linking the protein to metabolism and stress. The structure, along with supporting solution studies, shows that YacG represses gyrase by sterically occluding the principal DNA-binding site of the enzyme. Unexpectedly, YacG acts by both engaging two spatially segregated regions associated with small-molecule inhibitor interactions (fluoroquinolone antibiotics and the newly reported antagonist GSK299423) and remodeling the gyrase holoenzyme into an inactive, ATP-trapped configuration. This study establishes a new mechanism for the protein-based control of topoisomerases, an approach that may be used to alter supercoiling levels for responding to changes in cellular state.",gyrase;DNA topology;YacG;type II topoisomerase;transcription;metabolism

Previous studies revealed that SIRT1 deficiency results in genome instability, which eventually leads to cancer formation, yet the underlying mechanism is unclear. To investigate this, we conducted a proteomics study and found that SIRT1 interacted with many proteins involved in replication fork protection and origin firing. We demonstrated that loss of SIRT1 resulted in increased replication origin firing, asymmetric fork progression, defective intra-S-phase checkpoint, and chromosome damage. Mechanistically, SIRT1 deacetylates and affects the activity of TopBP1, which plays an essential role in DNA replication fork protection and replication origin firing. Our study demonstrated that ectopic over-expression of the deacetylated form of TopBP1 in SIRT1 mutant cells repressed replication origin firing, while the acetylated form of TopBP1 lost this function. Thus, SIRT1 acts upstream of TopBP1 and plays an essential role in maintaining genome stability by modulating DNA replication fork initiation and the intra-S-phase cell cycle checkpoint.",SIRT1;TopBP1;Intra-S-phase checkpoint;DNA replication fork;Genetic stability.

It is designed to last a lifetime in spite of severe environmental challenges. Enamel is formed in a biomineralization process that is essentially divided into secretory and maturation stages. While the molecular events of enamel formation during the secretory stage have been elucidated to some extent, the mechanisms of enamel maturation are less defined, and little is known about the molecules present beyond the maturation stage. Several genes, all located within the secreted calcium-binding phosphoprotein (SCPP) gene cluster, were recently shown to be expressed during the developmental continuum from maturation stage ameloblasts to junctional epithelium (JE). This review introduces four such genes and their protein products, and presents our current state of knowledge on their roles, primarily in enamel formation and JE biology. The discovery of these proteins, and a more detailed analysis of their biological functions, will likely contribute to a more thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms of enamel maturation and dentogingival attachment.",enamel;maturation stage;junctional epithelium;protein identification;SCPP gene cluster

Using hydrogen/deuterium exchange and electron microscopy, we explored conformational changes in kinesin-13 MCAK in its dimeric form and when bound to a depolymerization intermediate. ATP hydrolysis relaxes the conformation of the free dimer, notably in the neck and N-terminal domain. Exchanging dimeric MCAK with ATP at the MT plus end induces outward curvature in α/β-tubulin, accompanied by a restructuring of the MCAK neck and N-terminus, as it returns to a closed state. Re-establishing a closed dimer state imparts a lateral separation of paired tubulin dimers, which may assist in depolymerization. Thus, full-length ADP-MCAK transitions from an open diffusion-competent configuration to a closed state upon plus-end mediated nucleotide exchange, which is primarily mediated by conformational changes in the N-terminal domains of the dimer.",

another, acceptor (A) is the basis of many fundamental chemical and 
physical processes. The ET mechanism is controlled by spatial arrangements of 
donor and acceptors: it’s the particular spatial arrangement and thus 
the particular distance and the orientation between the electron donors and 
acceptors that controls the efficiency in charge separation processes in nature. 
Here, we stress the importance of this concept reviewing how spatial 
distribution of atomic and molecular self-assembly can determine the quality and 
physical features of ET process from biology to material science. In this 
context, we propose novel lab-on-chip techniques to be used to control 
spatial distribution of molecules at nanoscale. Synchrotron source brightness 
jointly to focusing optics fabrication allows one nowadays to monitor and 
visualize structures with sub-micrometric spatial resolution. This can give us a 
new powerful tool to set up sophisticated X-ray imaging techniques as well as 
spectroscopic elemental and chemical mapping to investigate the 
structure-function relationship controlling the spatial arrangement of the

Unfortunately, many tumors are resistant to this therapy. We sought to identify ways of sensitizing tumor cells to alkylating agents while leaving normal cells unharmed; increasing therapeutic response while minimizing toxicity. Using a siRNA screen targeting over 240 DNA damage response genes, we identified novel sensitizers to alkylating agents. In particular the base excision repair (BER) pathway, including 3-methylpurine-DNA glycosylase (MPG), as well as ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) were identified in our screen. Interestingly, we identified MPG as a direct novel substrate of ATM. ATM-mediated phosphorylation of MPG was required for enhanced MPG function. Importantly, combined inhibition or loss of MPG and ATM resulted in increased alkylating agent-induced cytotoxicity in vitro and prolonged survival in vivo. The discovery of the ATM-MPG axis will lead to improved treatment of alkylating agent-resistant tumors.",

The T4SSs encompass two large subfamilies, the conjugation systems and the effector translocators. The conjugation systems mediate interbacterial DNA transfer and are responsible for the rapid dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes and virulence determinants in clinical settings. The effector translocators are used by many Gram-negative bacterial pathogens for delivery of potentially hundreds of virulence proteins to eukaryotic cells for modulation of different physiological processes during infection. Recently, there has been considerable progress in defining the structures of T4SS machine subunits and large machine subassemblies. Additionally, the nature of substrate translocation sequences and the contributions of accessory proteins to substrate docking with the translocation channel have been elucidated. A DNA translocation route through the Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirB/VirD4 system was defined, and both intracellular (DNA ligand, ATP energy) and extracellular (phage binding) signals were shown to activate type IV-dependent translocation. Finally, phylogenetic studies have shed light on the evolution and distribution of T4SSs, and complementary structure-function studies of diverse systems have identified adaptations tailored for novel functions in pathogenic settings.

The N-terminal domain of TRPM8 consists of 693 amino acids, but little is known about its contribution to channel function. Here, we identified two distinct regions within the initial N terminus of TRPM8 that contribute differentially to channel activity and proper folding and assembly. Deletion or substitution of the first 40 residues yielded channels with augmented responses to cold and menthol. The thermal threshold of activation of these mutants was shifted 2 °C to higher temperatures, and the menthol dose-response curve was displaced to lower concentrations. Site-directed mutagenesis screening revealed that single point mutations at positions Ser-26 or Ser-27 by proline caused a comparable increase in the responses to cold and menthol. Electrophysiological analysis of the S27P mutant revealed that the enhanced sensitivity to agonists is related to a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation, increasing the probability of channel openings at physiological membrane potentials. In addition, we found that the region encompassing positions 40–60 is a key element in the proper folding and assembly of TRPM8. Different deletions and mutations within this region rendered channels with an impaired function that are retained within the endoplasmic reticulum.

In the present study, homology models of MK5 were used for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of: (1) MK5 alone; (2) MK5 in complex with an inhibitor; and (3) MK5 in complex with the interaction partner p38α. The calculations showed that the inhibitor occupied the active site and disrupted the intramolecular network of amino acids. However, intramolecular interactions consistent with an inactive protein kinase fold were not formed. MD with p38α showed that not only the p38 docking region, but also amino acids in the activation segment, αH helix, P-loop, regulatory phosphorylation region and the C-terminal of MK5 may be involved in forming a very stable MK5-p38α complex, and that p38α binding decreases the residual fluctuation of the MK5 model.

Attributed to their capability of self-renewal and differentiation into most types of somatic cells, stem cells also hold tremendous promise for regenerative medicine and drug screening. However, a major challenge remains as to achieve fate control of stem cells in vitro with high specificity and yield. Recent exciting advances in nanotechnology and materials science have enabled versatile, robust, and large-scale stem cell engineering in vitro through developments of synthetic nanotopographical surfaces mimicking topological features of stem cell niches. In addition to generating new insights for stem cell biology and embryonic development, this effort opens up unlimited opportunities for innovations in stem cell-based applications. This review is therefore to provide a summary of recent progress along this research direction, with perspectives focusing on emerging methods for generating nanotopographical surfaces and their applications in stem cell research. Furthermore, we provide a review of classical as well as emerging cellular mechano-sensing and -transduction mechanisms underlying stem cell nanotopography sensitivity and also give some hypotheses in regard to how a multitude of signaling events in cellular mechanotransduction may converge and be integrated into core pathways controlling stem cell fate in response to extracellular nanotopography.",Biomaterials;Nanotopography;Stem cell;Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine;Mechanobiology

We report the three-dimensional structure, substrate, and inhibitor binding specificity of AGPase small subunit from different monocot and dicot crop plants. Both monocot and dicot subunits were found to exploit similar interactions with the substrate and inhibitor molecule as in the case of their closest homologue potato tuber AGPase small subunit. Comparative sequence and structural analysis followed by molecular docking and electrostatic surface potential analysis reveal that rearrangements of secondary structure elements, substrate, and inhibitor binding residues are strongly conserved and follow common folding pattern and orientation within monocot and dicot displaying a similar mode of allosteric regulation and catalytic mechanism.

the membrane remodeling capacity of the N-terminal
membrane-binding domain of α-synuclein (α-Syn100). Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and vesicle clearance
assays, we show that α-Syn100 fully tubulates POPG
vesicles, the first demonstration that the amphipathic helix on its
own is capable of this effect. We also show that at equal density
of membrane-bound protein, α-Syn has dramatically reduced affinity
for, and does not tubulate, vesicles composed of a 1:1 POPG:POPC mixture.
Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the difference
between the pure POPG and mixture results may be attributed to differences
in the protein’s partition depth, the membrane’s hydrophobic
thickness, and disruption of acyl chain order. To explore the importance
of these attributes compared with the role of the reduced binding
energy, we created an α-Syn100 variant in which we
removed the hydrophobic core of the non-amyloid component (NAC) domain
and tested its impact on pure POPG vesicles. We observed a substantial
reduction in binding affinity and tubulation, and simulations of the
NAC-null protein suggested that the reduced binding energy increases
the protein mobility on the bilayer surface, likely impacting the
protein’s ability to assemble into organized pretubule structures.
We also used simulations to explore a potential role for interleaflet
coupling as an additional driving force for tubulation. We conclude
that symmetry across the leaflets in the tubulated state maximizes
the interaction energy of the two leaflets and relieves the strain
induced by the hydrophobic void beneath the amphipathic helix.",

Each flagellum consists of a basal body, a hook, and a filament. The major protein of the filament is flagellin. Induction of flagellin gene expression coincides with secretion of FlgM. The role of FlgM is to inhibit FliA (σ28), a flagellum-specific RNA polymerase responsible for flagellin transcription. To prevent premature polymerization of newly synthesized flagellin molecules, FliS, the flagellin-specific chaperone, binds flagellin and facilitates its export. In this study, the interaction between FlgM and FliS from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was characterized using gel shift, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, circular dichroism, limited proteolysis, and cross-linking. We have demonstrated that (i) FliS and FlgM interact specifically, forming a 1:1 complex, (ii) the FliS binding site on FlgM is proximal to or even overlaps the binding site for FliA, and (iii) FliA competes with FliS for FlgM binding.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that the frame-shift protein P3N-PIPO (for the protein encoded by the open reading frame [ORF] containing 5′-terminus of P3 and a +2 frame-shift ORF called Pretty Interesting Potyviridae ORF and embedded in the P3) and CYLINDRICAL INCLUSION (CI) proteins were required for potyvirus cell-to-cell movement. Here, we provide genetic evidence showing that a Tobacco vein banding mosaic virus (TVBMV; genus Potyvirus) mutant carrying a truncated PIPO domain of 58 amino acid residues could move between cells and induce systemic infection in Nicotiana benthamiana plants; mutants carrying a PIPO domain of seven, 20, or 43 amino acid residues failed to move between cells and cause systemic infection in this host plant. Interestingly, the movement-defective mutants produced progeny that eliminated the previously introduced stop codons and thus restored their systemic movement ability. We also present evidence showing that a developmentally regulated plasma membrane protein of N. benthamiana (referred to as NbDREPP) interacted with both P3N-PIPO and CI of the movement-competent TVBMV. The knockdown of NbDREPP gene expression in N. benthamiana impeded the cell-to-cell movement of TVBMV. NbDREPP was shown to colocalize with TVBMV P3N-PIPO and CI at plasmodesmata (PD) and traffic to PD via the early secretory pathway and the actomyosin motility system. We also show that myosin XI-2 is specially required for transporting NbDREPP to PD. In conclusion, NbDREPP is a key host protein within the early secretory pathway and the actomyosin motility system that interacts with two movement proteins and influences virus movement.",

In bacteria, this is achieved through regulation of the interaction between the initiator protein DnaA and specific DNA elements arrayed at the origin of replication. DnaA assembles at the origin and promotes DNA unwinding and the assembly of a replication initiation complex. SirA is a DnaA-interacting protein that inhibits initiation of replication in diploid Bacillus subtilis cells committed to the developmental pathway leading to formation of a dormant spore. Here we present the crystal structure of SirA in complex with the N-terminal domain of DnaA revealing a heterodimeric complex. The interacting surfaces of both proteins are α-helical with predominantly apolar side-chains packing in a hydrophobic interface. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments confirm the importance of this interface for the interaction of the two proteins in vitro and in vivo. Localization of GFP–SirA indicates that the protein accumulates at the replisome in sporulating cells, likely through a direct interaction with DnaA.

ROS generate DNA damage of which pathological consequence, including cancer is well established. Research efforts are intense to understand the mechanism of DNA base excision repair, the primary mechanism to protect cells from genotoxicity caused by ROS. Recent Advances: In addition to the notion that oxidative DNA damage causes transformation of cells, recent studies have revealed how the mitochondrial deficiencies and ROS generation alter cell growth during the cancer transformation. Critical Issues: The emphasis of this review is to highlight the importance of the cellular response to oxidative DNA damage during carcinogenesis. Oxidative DNA damage, including 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine, play an important role during the cellular transformation. It is also becoming apparent that the unusual activity and subcellular distribution of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1, an essential DNA repair factor/redox sensor, affect cancer malignancy by increasing cellular resistance to oxidative stress and by positively influencing cell proliferation. Future Directions: Technological advancement in cancer cell biology and genetics has enabled us to monitor the detailed DNA repair activities in the microenvironment. Precise understanding of the intracellular activities of DNA repair proteins for oxidative DNA damage should provide help in understanding how mitochondria, ROS, DNA damage, and repair influence cancer transformation.

Here we provide in vitro and in vivo evidence of co-assembly and co-localization of ameloblastin with amelogenin using both biophysical and immunohistochemical methods. We performed co-localization studies using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy with paraffin-embedded tissue sections from mandibular molars of mice at 1, 5, and 8 days of age. Commercially-available ameloblastin antibody (M300) against mouse ameloblastin residues 107–407 and an antibody against full-length recombinant mouse (rM179) amelogenin were used. Ameloblastin-M300 clearly reacted along the secretory face of ameloblasts from days 1–8. Quantitative co-localization was analyzed (QCA) in several configurations by choosing appropriate regions of interest (ROIs). Analysis of ROIs along the secretory face of ameloblasts revealed that at day 1, very high percentages of both the ameloblastin and amelogenin co-localized. At day 8 along the ameloblast cells the percentage of co-localization remained high for the ameloblastin whereas co-localization percentage was reduced for amelogenin. Analysis of the entire thickness on day 8 revealed no significant co-localization of amelogenin and ameloblastin. With the progress of amelogenesis and ameloblastin degradation, there was a segregation of ameloblastin and co-localization with the C-terminal region decreased. CD spectra indicated that structural changes in ameloblastin occurred upon addition of amelogenin.

Flexible fitting of a protomer of the EFF-1 crystal structure, which is homologous to viral class-II fusion proteins, shows that EFF-1 has a hairpin monomeric conformation before fusion. These structural insights, when combined with our observations of membrane-merging intermediates between vesicles, enable us to propose a model for EFF-1 mediated fusion.

It conducts Zn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+ as well as monovalent cations, and contains a functional serine/threonine kinase at its carboxyl terminus. Here, we show that in normal tissues and cell lines, the kinase is proteolytically cleaved from the channel domain in a cell type-specific manner. These TRPM7 Cleaved Kinase fragments (M7CKs) translocate to the nucleus and bind multiple components of chromatin remodeling complexes, including Polycomb group proteins. In the nucleus, the kinase phosphorylates specific serines/threonines of histones. M7CK-dependent phosphorylation of H3Ser10 at promoters of TRPM7-dependent genes correlates with their activity. We also demonstrate that cytosolic free [Zn2+] is TRPM7-dependent and regulates M7CK binding to transcription factors containing zinc-finger domains. These findings suggest that TRPM7-mediated modulation of intracellular Zn2+ concentration couples ion channel signaling to epigenetic chromatin covalent modifications that affect gene expression patterns.",

Four of the seven human A3s restrict HIV by 'hypermutating' the reverse-transcribed viral genomic DNA. HIV Virion Infectivity Factor (Vif) counters this restriction by targeting A3s to proteasomal degradation. However, there is no apparent correlation between catalytic activity, Vif binding, and sequence similarity between A3 domains. Our comparative structural analysis reveals features required for binding Vif and features influencing polynucleotide deaminase activity in A3 proteins. All Vif-binding A3s share a negatively charged surface region that includes residues previously implicated in binding the highly-positively charged Vif. Additionally, catalytically active A3s share a positively charged groove near the Zn2+ coordinating active site, which may accommodate the negatively charged polynucleotide substrate.

Although numerous genes encoding cuticular proteins have been identified in known insect genomes to date, their functions in maintaining insect body shape and adaptability remain largely unknown. In the current study, positional cloning led to the identification of a gene encoding an RR1-type cuticular protein, BmorCPR2, highly expressed in larval chitin-rich tissues and at the mulberry leaf-eating stages, which is responsible for the silkworm stony mutant. In the Dazao-stony strain, the BmorCPR2 allele is a deletion mutation with significantly lower expression, compared to the wild-type Dazao strain. Dysfunctional BmorCPR2 in the stony mutant lost chitin binding ability, leading to reduced chitin content in larval cuticle, limitation of cuticle extension, abatement of cuticle tensile properties, and aberrant ratio between internodes and intersegmental folds. These variations induce a significant decrease in cuticle capacity to hold the growing internal organs in the larval development process, resulting in whole-body stiffness, tightness, and hardness, bulging intersegmental folds, and serious defects in larval adaptability. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the corresponding phenotype of stony in insects caused by mutation of RR1-type cuticular protein. Our findings collectively shed light on the specific role of cuticular proteins in maintaining normal larval body shape and will aid in the development of pest control strategies for the management of Lepidoptera.",Bombyx mori;stony mutant;RR1-type cuticular protein;cuticle physical properties;larval morphological characteristics and adaptability

Perhaps not surprisingly, cells have evolved multiple pathways, some overlapping and others complementary, to resolve misfolded proteins when they arise, ranging from refolding through the action of molecular chaperones to elimination through regulated proteolytic mechanisms. These protein quality control pathways are sufficient, under normal conditions, to maintain a functioning proteome, but in response to diverse environmental, genetic, and/or stochastic events, protein misfolding exceeds the corrective capacity of these pathways, leading to the accumulation of aggregates and ultimately toxicity. Particularly devastating examples of these effects include certain neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington’s Disease, which are associated with the expansion of polyglutamine tracks in proteins. In these cases, protein misfolding and aggregation are clear contributors to pathogenesis, but uncovering the precise mechanistic links between the two events remains an area of active research. Studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other model systems have uncovered previously unanticipated complexity in aggregation pathways, the contributions of protein quality control processes to them, and the cellular perturbations that result from them. Together these studies suggest that aggregate interactions and localization, rather than their size, are the crucial considerations in understanding the molecular basis of toxicity.",

Here we show that in [PIN+] but not [pin−] cells, overexpression of Pin4C is deadly and linked to hyperphosphorylation of aggregated Pin4C. Furthermore, Pin4C aggregation, hyperphosphorylation and toxicity are simultaneously reversed by Sis1 overexpression. Toxicity may result from proteasome overload because hyperphosphorylated Pin4C aggregation is associated with reduced degradation of a ubiquitin-protein degradation reporter. Finally, hyperphosphorylation of endogenous full-length Pin4 was also facilitated by [PIN+], revealing that a prion can regulate posttranslational modification of another protein.",Prion toxicity;amyloid phosphorylation;Ubiquitin-proteasome system impairment

As a result, long MD trajectories tend to drift away from the starting coordinates (e.g., crystallographic structures). To address this problem, we have devised a new simulation strategy aimed at protein crystals. An MD simulation of protein crystal is essentially an ensemble simulation involving multiple protein molecules in a crystal unit cell (or a block of unit cells). To ensure that average protein coordinates remain correct during the simulation, we introduced crystallography-based restraints into the MD protocol. Because these restraints are aimed at the ensemble-average structure, they have only minimal impact on conformational dynamics of the individual protein molecules. So long as the average structure remains reasonable, the proteins move in a native-like fashion as dictated by the original force field. To validate this approach, we have used the data from solid-state NMR spectroscopy, which is the orthogonal experimental technique uniquely sensitive to protein local dynamics. The new method has been tested on the well-established model protein, ubiquitin. The ensemble-restrained MD simulations produced lower crystallographic R factors than conventional simulations; they also led to more accurate predictions for crystallographic temperature factors, solid-state chemical shifts, and backbone order parameters. The predictions for 15N R1 relaxation rates are at least as accurate as those obtained from conventional simulations. Taken together, these results suggest that the presented trajectories may be among the most realistic protein MD simulations ever reported. In this context, the ensemble restraints based on high-resolution crystallographic data can be viewed as protein-specific empirical corrections to the standard force fields.",protein structure and dynamics;Molecular Dynamics simulations;force fields;solid-state NMR;protein crystallography;chemical shifts;crystallographic R factors;crystallographic B factors;order parameters;15N relaxation;ubiquitin

Currently, neurotoxicity is attributed to prefibrillar oligomeric species rather than the insoluble aggregates, although their mechanisms of toxicity remain elusive. Structural details of the supramolecular organization of AS oligomers are critically needed to decipher the structure-toxicity relationship underlying their pathogenicity. In this study, we employed site-specific fluorescence to get a deeper insight into the internal architecture of AS oligomeric intermediates. We demonstrate that AS oligomers are ordered assemblies possessing a well defined pattern of intermolecular contacts. Some of these contacts involve regions that form the β-sheet core in the fibrillar state, although their spatial arrangement may differ in the two aggregated forms. However, even though the two termini are excluded from the fibrillar core, they are engaged in a number of intermolecular interactions within the oligomer. Therefore, substantial structural remodeling of early oligomeric interactions is essential for fibril growth. The intermolecular contacts identified in AS oligomers can serve as targets for the rational design of anti-amyloid compounds directed at preventing oligomeric interactions/reorganizations.",Alpha-synuclein (a-Synuclein);Amyloid;Fluorescence;Parkinson Disease;Protein Aggregation

Comparison of the ZYG-1 and DmPlk4 CPBs revealed structural changes in the ZYG-1 CPB that confer selectivity for binding SPD-2 over asterless-derived acidic regions. Overall, our findings suggest a conserved mechanism for centriolar docking of Plk4 homologs that initiate daughter centriole assembly.",centriole;cryptic polo box;crystallography;polo-like kinase;ZYG-1;Plk4

Much less is known about weaker interactions and transient complexes because these are challenging to characterize experimentally. Nevertheless, these types of interactions are ubiquitous in living systems. The combination of NMR relaxation dispersion Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG) experiments and isothermal titration calorimetry allows the quantification of rapid binding kinetics for complexes with submillisecond lifetimes that are difficult to study using conventional techniques. We have used this approach to investigate the binding pathway of the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain from the Fyn tyrosine kinase, which forms complexes with peptide targets whose lifetimes are on the order of about a millisecond. Long range electrostatic interactions have been shown to play a critical role in the binding pathways of tightly binding complexes. The role of electrostatics in the binding pathways of transient complexes is less well understood. Similarly to previously studied tight complexes, we find that SH3 domain association rates are enhanced by long range electrostatics, whereas short range interactions are formed late in the docking process. However, the extent of electrostatic association rate enhancement is several orders of magnitudes less, whereas the electrostatic-free basal association rate is significantly greater. Thus, the SH3 domain is far less reliant on electrostatic enhancement to achieve rapid association kinetics than are previously studied systems. This suggests that there may be overall differences in the role played by electrostatics in the binding pathways of extremely stable versus transient complexes.",Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC);Ligand-binding Protein;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance;Protein Dynamic;Src Homology 3 Domain (SH3 Domain);Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG) Relaxation Dispersion

death stimuli in animals and fungi and, particularly, in the Neurospora
crassa response to staurosporine. We highlight the importance of
the extracellular availability of Ca2+ for this response. Limitation
of the ion in the culture medium further sensitizes cells to the drug and
results in increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Conversely,
an approximately 30-fold excess of external Ca2+ leads to increased
drug tolerance and lower ROS generation. In line with this, distinct
staurosporine-induced cytosolic Ca2+ signaling profiles were observed
in the absence or presence of excessive external Ca2+.
High-throughput RNA sequencing revealed that different concentrations of
extracellular Ca2+ define distinct transcriptional programs. Our
transcriptional profiling also pointed to two putative novel
Ca2+-binding proteins, encoded by the NCU08524 and NCU06607 genes,

In this study, we tested the possibility of preventing these undesirable effects by using a GLA-mimicking peptide as a competitor. An FX GLA domain-derived, 40-mer polypeptide carrying 12 carboxyglutamate residues was synthesized (GLAmim). Surface plasmon resistance (SPR) analysis showed that GLAmim reacted with free and capsid-embedded hexon with a nanomolar affinity. Unexpectedly, GLAmim failed to compete with FX for hexon binding, and instead significantly increased the formation of FX–hexon or FX–adenovirion complexes. This observation was confirmed by in vitro cell transduction experiments using HAdV-C5-Luciferase vector (HAdV5-Luc), as preincubation of HAdV5-Luc with GLAmim before FX addition resulted in a higher transgene expression compared with FX alone. HAdV-C5 virions complexed with GLAmim were analyzed by cryoelectron microscopy. Image reconstruction demonstrated the bona fide hexon–GLAmim interaction, as for the full-length FX, although with considerable differences in stoichiometry and relative location on the hexon capsomer. Three extra densities were found at the periphery of each hexon, whereas one single FX molecule occupied the central cavity of the hexon trimeric capsomer. A refined analysis indicated that each extra density is found at the expected location of one highly variable loop 1 of the hexon, involved in scavenger receptor recognition. HAdV5-Luc complexed with a bifunctional GLAmimRGD peptide showed a lesser hepatotropism, compared with control HAdV5-Luc alone, and efficiently targeted αβ-integrin-overexpressing tumor cells in an in vivo mouse tumor model. Collectively, our findings open new perspectives in the design of adenoviral vectors for biotherapy.",

However, the molecular pathways involved in the cross-talk between these two mTOR-dependent cell processes are largely unknown. Here we show that the scaffold protein AMBRA1, a member of the autophagy signalling network and a downstream target of mTOR, regulates cell proliferation by facilitating the dephosphorylation and degradation of the proto-oncogene C-MYC. We found that AMBRA1 favors the interaction between C-MYC and its phosphatase PP2A and that, when mTOR is inhibited, it enhances PP2A activity on this specific target, thereby reducing the cell division rate. As expected, such a de-regulation of C-MYC correlates with increased tumorigenesis in AMBRA1-defective systems, thus supporting a role for AMBRA1 as a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor gene.",cancer;cell cycle;cell metabolism;mTOR;phosphatases

Increasing evidence shows that osteoporosis and hip fracture are common complication observed in AD patients, although the mechanisms underlying this association remain poorly understood. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are emerging as intracellular redox signaling molecules involved in the regulation of bone metabolism, including receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand-dependent osteoclast differentiation, but they also have cytotoxic effects that include lipoperoxidation and oxidative damage to proteins and DNA. ROS generation, which is implicated in the regulation of cellular stress response mechanisms, is an integrated, highly regulated, process under control of redox sensitive genes coding for redox proteins called vitagenes. Vitagenes, encoding for proteins such as heat shock proteins (Hsps) Hsp32, Hsp70, the thioredoxin, and the sirtuin protein, represent a systems controlling a complex network of intracellular signaling pathways relevant to life span and involved in the preservation of cellular homeostasis under stress conditions. Consistently, nutritional anti-oxidants have demonstrated their neuroprotective potential through a hormetic-dependent activation of vitagenes. The biological relevance of dose–response affects those strategies pointing to the optimal dosing to patients in the treatment of numerous diseases. Thus, the heat shock response has become an important hormetic target for novel cytoprotective strategies focusing on the pharmacological development of compounds capable of modulating stress response mechanisms. Here we discuss possible signaling mechanisms involved in the activation of vitagenes which, relevant to bone remodeling and through enhancement of cellular stress resistance provide a rationale to limit the deleterious consequences associated to homeostasis disruption with consequent impact on the aging process.",oxidative stress;redox status;Alzheimer’s disease;cellular stress response;hormesis;vitagenes

Interest is mounting in tankyrase inhibitors (TNKSi) which destabilize β-catenin through stabilizing Axin. Here, we confirm that TNKSi inhibit Wnt-induced transcription, similarly to carnosate which reduces the transcriptional activity of β-catenin by blocking its binding to BCL9, and attenuates intestinal tumors in ApcMin mice. By contrast, β-catenin’s activity is unresponsive to TNKSi in colorectal cancer cells, and in cells after prolonged Wnt stimulation. This TNKSi insensitivity is conferred by β-catenin’s association with LEF1 and BCL9-2/B9L, which accumulate during Wnt stimulation, thereby providing a feed-forward loop that converts transient into chronic β-catenin signaling. This limits the therapeutic value of TNKSi in colorectal carcinomas most of which express high LEF1 levels. Our study provides proof-of-concept that the successful inhibition of oncogenic β-catenin in colorectal cancer requires the targeting of its interaction with LEF1 and/or BCL9/B9L, as exemplified by carnosate.",oncogenic β-catenin;APC tumor suppressor;carnosic acid;tankyrase inhibitor;LEF1;BCL9-2/B9L;ApcMin mouse model;colorectal cancer

We theorize these activity-dependent (A-D) developmental processes are specifically impaired in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). ASD genetic models in both mouse and Drosophila have pioneered our insights into normal A-D neural circuit assembly and consolidation, and how these developmental mechanisms go awry in specific genetic conditions. The monogenic fragile X syndrome (FXS), a common cause of heritable ASD and intellectual disability, has been particularly well linked to defects in A-D critical period processes. The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is positively activity-regulated in expression and function, in turn regulates excitability and activity in a negative feedback loop, and appears to be required for the A-D remodeling of synaptic connectivity during early-use critical periods. The Drosophila FXS model has been shown to functionally conserve the roles of human FMRP in synaptogenesis, and has been centrally important in generating our current mechanistic understanding of the FXS disease state. Recent advances in Drosophila optogenetics, transgenic calcium reporters, highly-targeted transgenic drivers for individually-identified neurons, and a vastly improved connectome of the brain are now being combined to provide unparalleled opportunities to both manipulate and monitor A-D processes during critical period brain development in defined neural circuits. The field is now poised to exploit this new Drosophila transgenic toolbox for the systematic dissection of A-D mechanisms in normal versus ASD brain development, particularly utilizing the well-established Drosophila FXS disease model.",fragile X syndrome;synaptogenesis;synapse elimination;E/I ratio;optogenetics;Drosophila

Unfortunately, we are still without effective treatments or a cure for this disease, which is having devastating consequences for patients, their families, and societies around the world. Until effective treatments are developed, promoting overall health may hold potential for delaying the onset or preventing neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. In particular, chronobiological concepts may provide a useful framework for identifying the earliest signs of age-related disease as well as inexpensive and noninvasive methods for promoting health. It is well reported that AD is associated with disrupted circadian functioning to a greater extent than normal aging. However, it is unclear if the central circadian clock (i.e., the suprachiasmatic nucleus) is dysfunctioning, or whether the synchrony between the central and peripheral clocks that control behavior and metabolic processes are becoming uncoupled. Desynchrony of rhythms can negatively affect health, increasing morbidity and mortality in both animal models and humans. If the uncoupling of rhythms is contributing to AD progression or exacerbating symptoms, then it may be possible to draw from the food-entrainment literature to identify mechanisms for re-synchronizing rhythms to improve overall health and reduce the severity of symptoms. The following review will briefly summarize the circadian system, its potential role in AD, and propose using a feeding-related neuropeptide, such as ghrelin, to synchronize uncoupled rhythms. Synchronizing rhythms may be an inexpensive way to promote healthy aging and delay the onset of neurodegenerative disease such as AD.",circadian rhythms;Alzheimer’s disease;food-entrainment;ghrelin;aging

This minireview presents a critical evaluation of our knowledge of the candidacidal mechanism of histatin 5 (Hst 5). Hst 5 is the most potent among all histatin family members with regard to its antifungal activity. The mode of action of Hst 5 has been a subject of intense debate. Unlike other classical host innate immune proteins, pore formation or membrane lysis by Hst 5 has largely been disproven, and it is now known that all targets of Hst 5 are intracellular. Hst 5 binds C. albicans cell wall proteins (Ssa1/2) and glycans and is taken up by the cells through fungal polyamine transporters in an energy-dependent manner. Once inside the fungal cells, Hst 5 may affect mitochondrial functions and cause oxidative stress; however, the ultimate cause of cell death is by volume dysregulation and ion imbalance triggered by osmotic stress. Besides these diverse targets, a novel mechanism based on the metal binding abilities of Hst 5 is discussed. Finally, translational approaches for Hst 5, based on peptide design and synergy with other known drugs, are considered a step forward for bench-to-bed application of Hst 5.",

More recently, data from several laboratories indicate that the most commonly encountered MLL fusion proteins, MLLT1, MLLT3, and AFF1 are found within a molecular complex that facilitates the elongation phase of mRNA transcription. Mutational analyses suggest that interaction between the MLLT1/3 proteins and AFF family proteins are required for experimental transformation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Here, we define a specific pairing of two amino acids that creates a salt bridge between MLLT1/3 and AFF proteins that is critically important for MLL-mediated transformation of HPCs. Our findings, coupled with the newly defined structure of MLLT3 in complex with AFF1, should facilitate the development of small molecules that block this amino acid interaction and interfere with the activity of the most common MLL oncoproteins.",Oncoproteins;protein binding;mutation complementation;leukemic transformation

Here, we study their dynamics using unbiased atomistic molecular simulations from representative filament crystal structures. In agreement with experimental data, we find different filament curvatures that are supported by a nucleotide-regulated hinge motion between consecutive FtsZ monomers. Whereas GTP-FtsZ filaments bend and twist in a preferred orientation, thereby burying the nucleotide, the differently curved GDP-FtsZ filaments exhibit a heterogeneous distribution of open and closed interfaces between monomers. We identify a coordinated Mg2+ ion as the key structural element in closing the nucleotide site and stabilizing GTP filaments, whereas the loss of the contacts with loop T7 from the next monomer in GDP filaments leads to open interfaces that are more prone to depolymerization. We monitored the FtsZ monomer assembly switch, which involves opening/closing of the cleft between the C-terminal domain and the H7 helix, and observed the relaxation of isolated and filament minus-end monomers into the closed-cleft inactive conformation. This result validates the proposed switch between the low-affinity monomeric closed-cleft conformation and the active open-cleft FtsZ conformation within filaments. Finally, we observed how the antibiotic PC190723 suppresses the disassembly switch and allosterically induces closure of the intermonomer interfaces, thus stabilizing the filament. Our studies provide detailed structural and dynamic insights into modulation of both the intrinsic curvature of the FtsZ filaments and the molecular switch coupled to the high-affinity end-wise association of FtsZ monomers.",

Haustoria are thought to enable the secretion of effector proteins into the plant cells. Haustorium biogenesis, therefore, is critical for pathogen accommodation in the host tissue. Haustoria are enveloped by a specialized host-derived membrane, the extrahaustorial membrane (EHM), which is distinct from the plant plasma membrane. The mechanisms underlying the biogenesis of the EHM are unknown. Remarkably, several plasma membrane-localized proteins are excluded from the EHM, but the remorin REM1.3 accumulates around P. infestans haustoria. Here, we used overexpression, colocalization with reporter proteins, and superresolution microscopy in cells infected by P. infestans to reveal discrete EHM domains labeled by REM1.3 and the P. infestans effector AVRblb2. Moreover, SYNAPTOTAGMIN1, another previously identified perihaustorial protein, localized to subdomains that are mainly not labeled by REM1.3 and AVRblb2. Functional characterization of REM1.3 revealed that it is a susceptibility factor that promotes infection by P. infestans. This activity, and REM1.3 recruitment to the EHM, require the REM1.3 membrane-binding domain. Our results implicate REM1.3 membrane microdomains in plant susceptibility to an oomycete pathogen.",

SSB can also locally diffuse on ssDNA, which allows it to quickly reposition itself while remaining bound to ssDNA. In this work, we used a hybrid instrument that combines single-molecule fluorescence and force spectroscopy to directly visualize the movement of Escherichia coli SSB on long polymeric ssDNA. Long ssDNA was synthesized without secondary structure which can hinder quantitative analysis of SSB movement. The apparent diffusion coefficient of E. coli SSB thus determined ranged from 70,000 to 170,000 nt2/s, which is at least six hundred times higher than that determined from SSB diffusion on short ssDNA oligomers, and is within the range of values reported for protein diffusion on double stranded DNA. Our work suggests that SSB can also migrate via a long range intersegment transfer on long ssDNA. The force dependence of SSB movement on ssDNA further supports this interpretation.",

The Nup62 complex contains the FG-repeat proteins Nup62, Nup54, and Nup58 and is located in the center of the NPC. The three proteins bind each other via conserved coiled-coil segments. To determine the stoichiometry of the Nup62 complex, we undertook an in vitro study using gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation. Our results reveal a 1:1:1 stoichiometry of the Nup62 complex, where Nup54 is central with direct binding to Nup62 and Nup58. At high protein concentration, the complex forms larger assemblies while maintaining the Nup62:Nup54:Nup58 ratio. For the homologous Nsp1 complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we determine the same stoichiometry, indicating evolutionary conservation. Furthermore, we observe that eliminating one binding partner can result in the formation of complexes with noncanonical stoichiometry, presumably because unpaired coiled-coil elements tend to find a promiscuous binding partner.

TRiC is hetero-oligomeric, comprising two stacked rings of eight different subunits each. Subunit diversification from simpler archaeal chaperonins appears linked to proteome expansion. Here, we integrate structural, biophysical and modeling approaches to identify the hitherto unknown substrate-binding site in TRiC and uncover the basis of substrate recognition. NMR and modeling provided a structural model of a chaperonin-substrate complex. Mutagenesis and crosslinking-mass spectrometry validated the identified substrate binding interface and demonstrate that TRiC contacts full-length substrates combinatorially in a subunit-specific manner. The binding site of each subunit has a distinct, evolutionarily conserved, pattern of polar and hydrophobic residues specifying recognition of discrete substrate motifs. The combinatorial recognition of polypeptides broadens the specificity of TRiC and may direct the topology of bound polypeptides along a productive folding trajectory, contributing to its unique ability to fold obligate substrates.",

The toxins are liberated from association with the cognate antitoxins by certain physiological triggers to impair vital cellular functions. TAs also are implicated in antibiotic persistence, biofilm formation, and bacteriophage resistance. Among the ever increasing number of TA modules that have been identified, the most numerous are complexes in which both toxin and antitoxin are proteins. Transcriptional autoregulation of the operons encoding these complexes is key to ensuring balanced TA production and to prevent inadvertent toxin release. Control typically is exerted by binding of the antitoxin to regulatory sequences upstream of the operons. The toxin protein commonly works as a transcriptional corepressor that remodels and stabilizes the antitoxin. However, there are notable exceptions to this paradigm. Moreover, it is becoming clear that TA complexes often form one strand in an interconnected web of stress responses suggesting that their transcriptional regulation may prove to be more intricate than currently understood. Furthermore, interference with TA gene transcriptional autoregulation holds considerable promise as a novel antibacterial strategy: artificial release of the toxin factor using designer drugs is a potential approach to induce bacterial suicide from within.",bacteria;toxin-antitoxin;transcription;regulation;antibacterial

Structural characterization of molecular partners has provided insight into the origins and relative importance of complementarity in mimicry. Chemical complementarity is easy to understand; amino acid sequence similarity between peptides, for example, can lead to cross-reactivity triggering similar reactivity from their cognate receptors. However, conformational complementarity is difficult to decipher. Molecular mimicry of carbohydrates by peptides is often considered one of those. Extensive studies of innate and adaptive immune responses suggests the existence of carbohydrate mimicry, but the structural basis for this mimicry yields confounding details; peptides mimicking carbohydrates in some cases fail to exhibit both chemical and conformational mimicry. Deconvolution of these two types of complementarity in mimicry and its relationship to biological function can nevertheless lead to new therapeutics. Here, we discuss our experience examining the immunological aspects and implications of carbohydrate–peptide mimicry. Emphasis is placed on the rationale, the lessons learned from the methodologies to identify mimics, a perspective on the limitations of structural analysis, the biological consequences of mimicking tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens, and the notion of reverse engineering to develop carbohydrate-mimetic peptides in vaccine design strategies to induce responses to glycan antigens expressed on cancer cells.",glycans;carbohydrate-mimetic peptide;mimotope;vaccines;structural design;cancer

The mechanisms underlying the timing of APC/C substrate degradation are poorly understood. We explored these mechanisms using quantitative fluorescence microscopy of GFP-tagged APC/CCdc20 substrates in living budding yeast cells. Degradation of the S cyclin, Clb5, begins early in mitosis, followed 6 min later by the degradation of securin and Dbf4. Anaphase begins when less than half of securin is degraded. The spindle assembly checkpoint delays the onset of Clb5 degradation but does not influence securin degradation. Early Clb5 degradation depends on its interaction with the Cdk1–Cks1 complex and the presence of a Cdc20-binding “ABBA motif” in its N-terminal region. The degradation of securin and Dbf4 is delayed by Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation near their Cdc20-binding sites. Thus, a remarkably diverse array of mechanisms generates robust ordering of APC/CCdc20 substrate destruction.",

Understanding cMyBP-C function and its role in disease requires knowledge of the structure of the molecule, its organization in the sarcomere and its interactions with other sarcomeric proteins. Here we review the main structural features of this modular, elongated molecule and the properties of some of its key domains.

We review structural and functional evidence for interaction of its N-terminal domains with actin and how this may modulate thin filament activation.

Consequently, much research is being undertaken into the causes and treatment. It has been found that inhibition of the β form of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (β-CaMKII) can ameliorate the disorder. Upon screening the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) database by molecular docking, sengesterone, labiatic acid, and methyl 3-O-feruloylquinate were selected for molecular dynamics. After 20 ns simulation, the RMSD, total energy, and structure variation could define the protein-ligand interaction. Furthermore, sengesterone, the principle candidate compound, has been found to have an effect on the regulation of emotions and memory development. In structure variation, we find the sample functional group of important amino acids make the protein stable and have limited variation. Due to similarity of structure variations, we suggest that these compounds may have an effect on β-CaMKII and that sengesterone may have a similar efficacy as the control. However labiatic acid may be a stronger inhibitor of β-CaMKII based on the larger RMSD and variation.",

Subsequently non-visual arrestins were shown to be signaling proteins in their own right, activating a variety of cellular pathways. Arrestins are highly flexible proteins that can assume several distinct conformations. In receptor-bound conformation, arrestins have higher affinity for a subset of partners. This explains how receptor activation regulates certain branches of arrestin-dependent signaling via arrestin recruitment to GPCRs. However, free arrestins are also active molecular entities that act in other pathways and localize signaling proteins to particular subcellular compartments, such as cytoskeleton. These functions are regulated by the enhancement or reduction of arrestin affinity for target proteins by other binding partners and by proteolytic cleavage. Recent findings suggest that the two visual arrestins expressed in photoreceptor cells do not regulate signaling solely via binding to photopigments, but also interact with a variety of non-receptor partners, critically affecting the health and survival of photoreceptor cells.

Phosphorylation of PLN at Ser16 reverses its inhibitory function under β-adrenergic stimulation, augmenting Ca2+ uptake in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and muscle contractility. PLN exists in two conformations; a T state, where the cytoplasmic domain is helical and absorbed on the membrane surface, and an R state, where the cytoplasmic domain is unfolded and membrane detached. Previous studies from our group have shown that the PLN conformational equilibrium is crucial to SERCA regulation. Here, we used a combination of solution and solid-state NMR techniques to compare the structural topology and conformational dynamics of monomeric PLN (PLNAFA) with that of the PLNR14del, a naturally occurring deletion mutant that is linked to the progression of dilated cardiomyopathy. We found that the behavior of the inhibitory transmembrane domain of PLNR14del is similar to that of the native sequence. In contrast, the conformational dynamics of R14del both in micelles and lipid membranes are enhanced. We conclude that the deletion of Arg14 in the cytoplasmic region weakens the interactions with the membrane and shifts the conformational equilibrium of PLN toward the disordered R state. This conformational transition is correlated with the loss-of-function character of this mutant and is corroborated by SERCA’s activity assays. These findings further support our hypothesis that SERCA function is fine-tuned by PLN conformational dynamics and begin to explain the aberrant regulation of SERCA by the R14del mutant.",Phospholamban;R14 deletion;conformational equilibrium;solid-state NMR;membrane proteins;SERCA;dilated cardiomyopathy

Nucleotide insertions and deletions (indels) have recently been shown to be critical for the evolution of antibody binding. Affinity maturation of 53 antibodies using in vitro SHM in a non-B cell context was compared with mutation patterns observed for SHM in vivo. The origin and frequency of indels seen during in vitro maturation were similar to that in vivo. Indels are localized to CDRs, and secondary mutations within insertions further optimize antigen binding. Structural determination of an antibody matured in vitro and comparison with human-derived antibodies containing insertions reveal conserved patterns of antibody maturation. These findings indicate that activation-induced cytidine deaminase acting on V-region sequences is sufficient to initiate authentic formation of indels in vitro and in vivo and that point mutations, indel formation, and clonal selection form a robust tripartite system for antibody evolution.",Antibody;Antigen;Cellular Immune Response;Protein Evolution;X-ray Crystallography

They represent highly cross-reactive allergens for patients with specific IgE to conserved epitopes. These patients might experience clinical reactions with various fish species. On the other hand, some individuals have IgE antibodies directed against unique, species-specific parvalbumin epitopes, and these patients show clinical symptoms only with certain fish species. Furthermore, different parvalbumin isoforms and isoallergens are present in the same fish and might display variable allergenicity. This was shown for salmon homologs, where only a single parvalbumin (beta-1) isoform was identified as allergen in specific patients.

However, recent studies demonstrate that in the nuclei, DNA is packed in tightly associated 10-nm fibers that are not compacted into 30-nm fibers. Additionally, the accessibility of DNA in chromatin depends on the local mobility of nucleosomes rather than on decompaction of chromosome regions. These findings argue for reconsidering the hierarchical model of chromatin packaging and some of the basic definitions of chromatin.

This virus has allowed the study of multiple aspects of norovirus biology and is presently considered a central tool for antiviral studies of human norovirus [33]. The genome of MNV has the three ORFs characteristic of noroviruses; the ORF1 encodes the nonstructural proteins and ORFs 2 and 3 encode the structural proteins VP1 and VP2. It has however the additional ORF4 that overlaps with ORF2 in a different reading frame and encodes VF1, a protein involved in the host innate immune response [24], [25]. The similarities in genome organization, protein function and structure allow to assume that the fundamental aspects of MNV and human norovirus replication are highly conserved [33]. Furthermore, MNV replicates in mice, spreads through the fecal-oral route and is shed at high levels in the feces. It is thus an enteric virus, capable of inducing gastroenteritis, with similarities in pathogenesis to human norovirus [31], [32].",Norovirus;Antiviral drugs;Small animal models;Cell culture models;Antiviral targets

Backbone cleavages at the N–Cα bonds of Xxx–Asp, Xxx–Asn, Xxx–Cys, and Gly–Xxx residues gave discontinuous intense peaks of c-ions, independent of positive and negative ion mode. The intensity values for c-ions, Int(c), were defined to allow estimation of the discontinuous intense peaks of c-ions. The identities of the high intensity value residues Asp, Asn, Cys, and Gly were compared with those identified using other measures of flexibility such as the B-factor, turn preferential factor and protection factor. The comparison indicates that Asp, Asn, and Gly residues are common to all measures.

The technique presented here yields rigid MT immobilization while simultaneously blocking the remaining glass surface against nonspecific binding by polystyrene optical trapping microspheres. This surface chemistry is straightforward and relatively cheap and uses a minimum of specialized equipment or hazardous reagents.

Nanoclusters have been viewed in terms of cooperativity and activation; here we perceive nanocluster organization from a conformational standpoint. This leads us to suggest that while single molecules encode activity, nanoclusters induce specificity, and that this is their main evolutionary aim. Distinct, isoform-specific nanocluster organization can drive the preferred effector (and ligand) interactions and thereby designate signalling pathways. The absence of detailed structural information across the nanocluster, due to size and dynamics, hinders an in-depth grasp of its mechanistic features; however, available data already capture some of the principles and their functional ‘raison d'être’. Collectively, clustering lends stability and reduces the likelihood of proteolytic cleavage; it also increases the effective local concentration and enables efficient cooperative activation. However, clustering does not determine the ability of the single molecule to function. Drugs targeting nanoclusters can attenuate activity by hampering cooperativity; however, this may not perturb activation and signalling, which originate from the molecules themselves, and as such, are likely to endure. What then is the major role of nanoclustering? Assuming that single molecules evolved first, with a subsequent increase in cellular complexity and emergence of highly similar isoform variants, evolution faced the threat of signalling promiscuity. We reason that this potential risk was thwarted by oligomerization and clustering; clustering confers higher specificity, and a concomitant extra layer of cellular control. In our Ras example, signalling will be more accurate as a dimer than as a monomer, where its isomer specificity could be compromised.",nanoclusters;signalling;oligomerization;structure;Ras;microclusters;cytoskeleton;allostery;conformational states;allosteric;scaffolding;co-localization

Ninety percent of α-SYN deposited in Lewy Bodies, a pathological hallmark of PD, is phosphorylated on serine129. α-SYN can also be phosphorylated on tyrosine125, which is believed to regulate the membrane binding capacity and thus possibly its normal function. A better understanding of the effect of phosphorylation on the aggregation of α-SYN might shed light on its role in the pathogenesis of PD. In this study we compare the aggregation properties of WT α-SYN with the phospho-dead and phospho-mimic mutants S129A, S129D, Y125F and Y125E and in vitro phosphorylated α-SYN using turbidity, thioflavin T and circular dichroism measurements as well as transmission electron microscopy. We show that the mutants S129A and S129D behave similarly compared to wild type (WT) α-SYN, while the mutants Y125F and Y125E fibrillate significantly slower, although all mutants form fibrillar structures similar to the WT protein. In contrast, in vitro phosphorylation of α-SYN on either S129 or Y125 does not significantly affect the fibrillization kinetics. Moreover, FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs), enzymes with peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity, still accelerate the aggregation of phosphorylated α-SYN in vitro, as was shown previously for WT α-SYN. In conclusion, our results illustrate that phosphorylation mutants can display different aggregation properties compared to the more biologically relevant phosphorylated form of α-SYN.",alpha-synuclein;phosphorylation;parkinson’s disease;phosphorylation mutants;FKBP;in vitro fibrillization

In sharp contrast to its functional importance, S1 is still lacking from the high-resolution structures available for Escherichia coli and Thermus thermophilus ribosomes and thus the molecular mechanism governing the S1–ribosome interaction has still remained elusive. Here, we present the structure of the N-terminal S1 domain D1 when bound to the ribosome at atomic resolution by using a combination of NMR, X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. Together with biochemical assays, the structure reveals that S1 is anchored to the ribosome primarily via a stabilizing π-stacking interaction within the short but conserved N-terminal segment that is flexibly connected to domain D1. This interaction is further stabilized by salt bridges involving the zinc binding pocket of protein S2. Overall, this work provides one hitherto enigmatic piece in the ′ribosome puzzle′, namely the detailed molecular insight into the topology of the S1–ribosome interface. Moreover, our data suggest novel mechanisms that have the potential to modulate protein synthesis in response to environmental cues by changing the affinity of S1 for the ribosome.",

Here, we show that BATF also has a fundamental role in regulating effector CD8+ T cell differentiation. BATF-deficient CD8+ T cells show profound defects in effector expansion and undergo proliferative and metabolic catastrophe early after antigen encounter. BATF, together with IRF4 and Jun proteins, binds to and promotes early expression of genes encoding lineage-specific transcription-factors (T-bet and Blimp-1) and cytokine receptors, while paradoxically repressing genes encoding effector molecules (IFN-γ and granzyme B). Thus, BATF amplifies TCR-dependent transcription factor expression and augments inflammatory signal propagation but restrains effector gene expression. This checkpoint prevents irreversible commitment to an effector fate until a critical threshold of downstream transcriptional activity has been achieved.",

The resultant structure of Hs-cHisRS·His represents the substrate-bound state (H-state) of the enzyme. It provides an interesting opportunity to compare with ligand-free and imidazole-bound structures Hs-cHisRS published recently, both of which represent the ligand-free state (F-state) of the enzyme. The H-state Hs-cHisRS undergoes conformational changes in active site residues and several conserved motif of HisRS, compared to F-state structures. The histidine forms eight hydrogen bonds with HisRS of which six engage the amino and carboxylate groups of this amino acid. The availability of published imidazole-bound structure provides a unique opportunity to dissect the structural roles of individual chemical groups of histidine. Remarkably, the analysis revealed the importance of the amino and carboxylate groups, of the histidine in leading to these dramatic conformational changes of the H-state. Further, comparison with previously published trypanosomatid HisRS structures reveals a pocket in the F-state of the parasite enzyme that may provide opportunities for developing specific inhibitors of Trypanosoma brucei HisRS.",histidyl-tRNA synthetase;drug design;trypanosome;sleeping sickness;Chagas disease

LEDGF associates with mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion proteins and menin and is required for leukemic transformation. To better understand the molecular mechanism underlying the LEDGF integrase-binding domain (IBD) interaction with MLL fusion proteins in leukemia, we determined the solution structure of the MLL-IBD complex. We found a novel MLL motif, integrase domain binding motif 2 (IBM2), which binds to a well-defined site on IBD. Point mutations within IBM2 abolished leukemogenic transformation by MLL-AF9, validating that this newly identified motif is essential for the oncogenic activity of MLL fusion proteins. Interestingly, the IBM2 binding site on IBD overlaps with the binding site for the HIV integrase (IN), and IN was capable of efficiently sequestering IBD from the menin-MLL complex. A short IBM2 peptide binds to IBD directly and inhibits both the IBD-MLL/menin and IBD-IN interactions. Our findings show that the same site on IBD is involved in binding to MLL and HIV-IN, revealing an attractive approach to simultaneously target LEDGF in leukemia and HIV.",

LapA is a member of a diverse family of predicted bacterial adhesins, and although lacking a high degree of sequence similarity, family members do share common predicted domains. Here, using mutational analysis, we determine the significance of each domain feature of LapA in relation to its export and localization to the cell surface and function in biofilm formation. Our previous work showed that the N terminus of LapA is required for cleavage by the periplasmic cysteine protease LapG and release of the adhesin from the cell surface under conditions unfavorable for biofilm formation. We define an additional critical region of the N terminus of LapA required for LapG proteolysis. Furthermore, our results suggest that the domains within the C terminus of LapA are not absolutely required for biofilm formation, export, or localization to the cell surface, with the exception of the type I secretion signal, which is required for LapA export and cell surface localization. In contrast, deletion of the central repetitive region of LapA, consisting of 37 repeats of 100 amino acids, results in an inability to form a biofilm. We also used single-molecule atomic force microscopy to further characterize the role of these domains in biofilm formation on hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. These studies represent the first detailed analysis of the domains of the LapA family of biofilm adhesin proteins.",

This reaction is catalyzed by a molybdenum- and selenium-dependent nicotinate dehydrogenase.246 Several molybdenum-containing enzymes are known to contain selenium,247 and a recent genomics analysis has shown that selenium and molybdenum utilization are highly correlated in biology.7n Selenium is most commonly found as selenocysteine (e.g., in the molybdenum-containing formate dehydrogenase H from E. coli, a member of the DMSO reductase family of enzymes, where it coordinates the active site molybdenum, at least in the oxidized state of the enzyme;248 see section 5.4.1) or in an acid-labile form (in members of the xanthine oxidase family of molybdenum enzymes, e.g., nicotinate dehydrogenase from E. barkeri246a and the xanthine oxidoreductases from Clostridium purinolyticum,249
C. acidiurici,250 and E. barkeri251 and the purine hydroxylase from C. purinolyticum249). In each of these cases, the selenium is essential for activity. The E. barkeri nicotinate dehydrogenase that utilizes NADP+ as oxidizing substrate is encoded by the ndhFSLM gene cluster, a part of a larger 23.3 kb gene cluster dedicated to the fermentation of nicotinate.252 The enzyme has an unusual (αβγδ)2 composition, with its NdhS subunit (23 kDa) containing two [2Fe-2S] clusters and NdhF subunit (33 kDa) one FAD molecule; atypically for the xanthine oxidase family of enzymes, the molybdenum-binding portion of nicotinate dehydrogenase is split into two separate subunits, NdhL (50 kDa) and NdhM (37 kDa).252,253 The crystal structure of nicotinate dehydrogenase shows that the selenium is present in the active site as a terminal Mo=Se ligand and that it occupies the same equatorial position in the molybdenum coordination sphere as the terminal sulfido ligand in other molybdenum hydroxylases.145b The role of selenium in catalysis has been assessed by density functional calculations, which indicate that the transition state for the critical hydride transfer from substrate to the molybdenum center (in a manner that closely follows the reaction mechanism of xanthine oxidase; see Figure 23) is stabilized by an additional 3 kcal/mol with selenium rather than sulfur in the molybdenum coordination sphere.145b This being the case, incorporation of selenium into the active site thus accounts for some two orders of magnitude of additional rate acceleration of the chemical step of the reaction.",

First, by physically engaging peptide-based endocytic sorting signals, a subset of clathrin-dependent transmembrane cargo is directly collected into assembling buds. Synchronously, by interacting with an assortment of clathrin-associated sorting proteins (CLASPs) that independently select different integral membrane cargo for inclusion within the incipient bud, AP-2 handles additional cargo capture indirectly. The distal platform subdomain of the AP-2 β2 subunit appendage is a privileged CLASP-binding surface that recognizes a cognate, short α-helical interaction motif. This signal, found in the CLASPs β-arrestin and the autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH) protein, docks into an elongated groove on the β2 appendage platform. Tyr-888 is a critical constituent of this spatially confined β2 appendage contact interface and is phosphorylated in numerous high-throughput proteomic studies. We find that a phosphomimetic Y888E substitution does not interfere with incorporation of expressed β2-YFP subunit into AP-2 or alter AP-2 deposition at surface clathrin-coated structures. The Y888E mutation does not affect interactions involving the sandwich subdomain of the β2 appendage, indicating that the mutated appendage is folded and operational. However, the Y888E, but not Y888F, switch selectively uncouples interactions with ARH and β-arrestin. Phyogenetic conservation of Tyr-888 suggests that this residue can reversibly control occupancy of the β2 platform-binding site and, hence, cargo sorting.",Endocytosis;G Protein-coupled Receptor (GPCR);Intracellular Trafficking;Lipoprotein;Phosphoproteomics;Phosphotyrosine Signaling;Clathrin

More recent evidence indicates a direct role of CaM in regulating several members of the connexin family. Since the intracellular loop and carboxyl termini of connexins are largely “invisible” in electron microscopy and X-ray crystallographic structures due to disorder in these domains, peptide models encompassing the putative CaM binding sites of several intracellular domains of connexins have been used to identify the Ca2+-dependent CaM binding sites of these proteins.

Guyenet,"1Department of Pharmacology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia;*Correspondence to ude.ainigriv.liam.smc@ggp","Lung ventilation fluctuates widely with behavior but arterial PCO2 remains stable. Under normal conditions, the chemoreflexes contribute to PaCO2 stability by producing small corrective cardiorespiratory adjustments mediated by lower brainstem circuits. Carotid body (CB) information reaches the respiratory pattern generator (RPG) via nucleus solitarius (NTS) glutamatergic neurons which also target rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) presympathetic neurons thereby raising sympathetic nerve activity (SNA). Chemoreceptors also regulate presympathetic neurons and cardiovagal preganglionic neurons indirectly via inputs from the RPG. Secondary effects of chemoreceptors on the autonomic outflows result from changes in lung stretch afferent and baroreceptor activity. Central respiratory chemosensitivity is caused by direct effects of acid on neurons and indirect effects of CO2 via astrocytes. Central respiratory chemoreceptors are not definitively identified but the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) is a particularly strong candidate. The absence of RTN likely causes severe central apneas in congenital central hypoventilation syndrome. Like other stressors, intense chemosensory stimuli produce arousal and activate circuits that are wake- or attention-promoting. Such pathways (e.g., locus coeruleus, raphe, and orexin system) modulate the chemoreflexes in a state-dependent manner and their activation by strong chemosensory stimuli intensifies these reflexes. In essential hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea and congestive heart failure, chronically elevated CB afferent activity contributes to raising SNA but breathing is unchanged or becomes periodic (severe CHF). Extreme CNS hypoxia produces a stereotyped cardiorespiratory response (gasping, increased SNA). The effects of these various pathologies on brainstem cardiorespiratory networks are discussed, special consideration being given to the interactions between central and peripheral chemoreflexes.",

The structures illustrate the molecular basis for cofactor and substrate binding and suggest that conformational changes of the two “arm” regions may modulate binding and release of substrates/products to and from the active site. Tyr-28 and His-139 were identified to play essential roles for methyl transfer reaction but are not indispensable for cofactor/substrate binding.

The CdiA effector extends from the surface of CDI+ inhibitor cells, binds to receptors on neighboring bacteria and delivers a toxin domain derived from its C-terminal region (CdiA-CT). Here, we show that CdiA-CT toxin translocation requires the proton-motive force (pmf) within target bacteria. The pmf is also critical for the translocation of colicin toxins, which exploit the energized Ton and Tol systems to cross the outer membrane. However, CdiA-CT translocation is clearly distinct from known colicin-import pathways because ΔtolA ΔtonB target cells are fully sensitive to CDI. Moreover, we provide evidence that CdiA-CT toxins can be transferred into the periplasm of de-energized target bacteria, indicating that transport across the outer membrane is independent of the pmf. Remarkably, CDI toxins transferred under de-energized conditions remain competent to enter the target-cell cytoplasm once the pmf is restored. Collectively, these results indicate that outer- and inner-membrane translocation steps can be uncoupled, and that the pmf is required for CDI toxin transport from the periplasm to the target-cell cytoplasm.",

Although Hsp90 is required for ligand binding in vivo, purified apoGR is capable of binding ligand with no enhancement from Hsp90. We reveal that Hsp70, known to facilitate client delivery to Hsp90, inactivates GR through partial unfolding, while Hsp90 reverses this inactivation. Full recovery of ligand binding requires ATP hydrolysis on Hsp90 and the HOP and p23 cochaperones. Surprisingly, energy from Hsp90 ATP hydrolysis appears to regulate client transfer from Hsp70, likely through a coupling of the two chaperone’s ATP cycles. Such coupling is embodied in novel contacts between Hsp90 and Hsp70 in the GR:Hsp70:Hsp90:HOP complex imaged by cryoEM. While GR released from Hsp70 is aggregation prone, release from Hsp90 protects GR from aggregation and enhances its ligand affinity. Together, this illustrates how coordinated chaperone interactions can enhance stability, function and regulation.",

This mechanism of action results in the recruitment of FN-engaged integrin α5β1 to fibrillar adhesions and the formation of integrin α5β1-Shc adaptor protein complexes. Here, we show that GPER-1 stimulation of murine 4 T1 or human SKBR3 breast cancer cells with 17β-estradiol (E2β) promotes the formation of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers and results in increased cellular adhesion and haptotaxis on FN, but not collagen. These actions are also induced by the xenoestrogen, bisphenol A, and the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist, ICI 182, 780, but not the inactive stereoisomer, 17α-estradiol (E2α). In addition, we show that GPER-1 stimulation of breast cancer cells allows for FN-dependent, anchorage-independent growth and FN fibril formation in “hanging drop” assays, indicating that these GPER-1-mediated actions occur independently of adhesion to solid substrata. Stable expression of Shc mutant Y317F lacking its primary tyrosyl phosphorylation site disrupts E2β-induced focal adhesion and actin stress fiber formation and abolishes E2β-enhanced haptotaxis on FN and anchorage-dependent growth. Collectively, these data demonstrate that E2β action via GPER-1 enhances cellular adhesivity and FN matrix assembly and allows for anchorage-independent growth, cellular events that may allow for cellular survival, and tumor progression.",

R67 DHFR is genetically and structurally unrelated to E. coli chromosomal DHFR and has an unusual architecture, in that four identical protomers form a single symmetrical active site tunnel that allows only one substrate binding/catalytic event at any given time. As a result, substitution of an active-site residue has as many as four distinct consequences on catalysis, constituting an atypical model of enzyme evolution. Although we previously demonstrated that no single residue of the native active site is indispensable for function, library selection here revealed a strong bias toward maintenance of two native protomers per mutated tetramer. A variety of such “half-native” tetramers were shown to procure native-like catalytic activity, with similar KM values but kcat values 5- to 33-fold lower, illustrating a high tolerance for active-site substitutions. The selected variants showed a reduced thermal stability (Tm ∼12°C lower), which appears to result from looser association of the protomers, but generally showed a marked increase in resilience to heat denaturation, recovering activity to a significantly greater extent than the variant with no active-site substitutions. Our results suggest that the presence of two native protomers in the R67 DHFR tetramer is sufficient to provide native-like catalytic rate and thus ensure cellular proliferation.",trimethoprim resistance;combinatorial mutations;thermostability;active site engineering;homotetramer

Here, we demonstrated that somatic deletion of Recql4 causes a rapid bone marrow failure in mice that involves cells from across the myeloid, lymphoid, and, most profoundly, erythroid lineages. Apoptosis was markedly elevated in multipotent progenitors lacking RECQL4 compared with WT cells. While the stem cell compartment was relatively spared in RECQL4-deficent mice, HSCs from these animals were not transplantable and even selected against. The requirement for RECQL4 was intrinsic in hematopoietic cells, and loss of RECQL4 in these cells was associated with increased replicative DNA damage and failed cell-cycle progression. Concurrent deletion of p53, which rescues loss of function in animals lacking the related helicase BLM, did not rescue BM phenotypes in RECQL4-deficient animals. In contrast, hematopoietic defects in cells from Recql4Δ/Δ mice were fully rescued by a RECQL4 variant without RecQ helicase activity, demonstrating that RECQL4 maintains hematopoiesis independently of helicase activity. Together, our data indicate that RECQL4 participates in DNA replication rather than genome stability and identify RECQL4 as a regulator of hematopoiesis with a nonredundant role compared with other RecQ helicases.",

Recently, we showed that palmitoylation is necessary to target NMNAT2 to post-Golgi vesicles, thereby influencing its protein turnover and axon protective capacity. Here we find that NMNAT2 is a substrate for cytosolic thioesterases APT1 and APT2 and that palmitoylation/depalmitoylation dynamics are on a time scale similar to its short half-life. Interestingly, however, depalmitoylation does not release NMNAT2 from membranes. The mechanism of palmitoylation-independent membrane attachment appears to be mediated by the same minimal domain required for palmitoylation itself. Furthermore, we identify several zDHHC palmitoyltransferases that influence NMNAT2 palmitoylation and subcellular localization, among which a role for zDHHC17 (HIP14) in neuronal NMNAT2 palmitoylation is best supported by our data. These findings shed light on the enzymatic regulation of NMNAT2 palmitoylation and highlight individual thioesterases and palmitoyltransferases as potential targets to modulate NMNAT2-dependent axon survival.",Enzyme;Intracellular Trafficking;Neurodegeneration;Protein Acylation;Protein Palmitoylation;APT1;APT2;NMNAT2;Palmitoyltransferase;zDHHC17

We show that Rad16 is important for proper completion of meiosis. In its absence, cells suffer reduced spore viability and abnormal chromosome segregation with evidence for fragmentation. Recombination between homologous chromosomes is increased, while recombination within sister chromatids is reduced, suggesting that Rad16 is not required for typical homolog crossovers but influences the balance of recombination between the homolog and the sister. In vegetative cells, rad16 mutants show evidence for genome instability. Similar phenotypes are associated with mutants affecting Rhp14XPA but are independent of other nucleotide excision repair proteins such as Rad13XPG. Thus, the XPF/XPA module of the nucleotide excision repair pathway is incorporated into multiple aspects of genome maintenance even in the absence of external DNA damage.",meiosis;Rad16;XPF;homologous recombination;NER

Here, we investigated the effects of a synthetic macromolecular crowding agent, dextran 20, on the folded states of hyperthermophilic (S16Thermo) and mesophilic (S16Meso) homologs of the ribosomal protein S16. As expected for an excluded-volume effect, the resistance of the mesophilic protein to heat-induced unfolding increased in the presence of dextran 20, and chemical denaturation experiments at different fixed temperatures showed the macromolecular crowding effect to be temperature-independent. Förster resonance energy transfer experiments show that intramolecular distances between an intrinsic Trp residue and BODIPY-labeled S16Meso depend on the level of the crowding agent. The BODIPY group was attached at three specific positions in S16Meso, allowing measurements of three intraprotein distances. All S16Meso variants exhibited a decrease in the average Trp-BODIPY distance at up to 100 mg/mL dextran 20, whereas the changes in distance became anisotropic (one distance increased, two distances decreased) at higher dextran concentrations. In contrast, the two S16Thermo mutants did not show any changes in Trp-BODIPY distances upon increase of dextran 20 concentrations. It should be noted that the fluorescence quantum yields and lifetimes of BODIPY attached to the two S16 homologs decreased gradually in the presence of dextran 20. To investigate the origin of this decrease, we studied the BODIPY quantum yield in three protein variants in the presence of a tyrosine-labeled dextran. The experiments revealed distinct tyrosine quenching behaviors of BODIPY in the three variants, suggesting a dynamic local interaction between dextran and one particular S16 variant.",

Here we have investigated the capability of this Fab to block Rev oligomerization and inhibit HIV-1 replication. The Fab itself did not have antiviral activity, but when a Tat-derived cell-penetrating peptide was appended, the resulting molecule (FabRev1-Tat) was strongly inhibitory of three different CCR5-tropic HIV-1 isolates (IC50 = 0.09–0.44 μg/ml), as assessed by suppression of reverse transcriptase activity in infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and had low cell toxicity (TC50 > 100 μg/ml). FabRev1-Tat was taken up by both peripheral blood mononuclear and HEK293T cells, appearing in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, as shown by immunofluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopy. Computational alanine scanning was used to identify key residues in the complementarity-determining regions to guide mutagenesis experiments. Residues in the light chain CDR3 (LCDR3) were assessed to be important. Residues in LCDR3 were mutated, and LCDR3-Tyr92 was found to be critical for binding to Rev, as judged by surface plasmon resonance and electron microscopy. Peptides corresponding to all six CDR regions were synthesized and tested for Rev binding. None of the linear peptides had significant affinity for Rev, but four of the amide-cyclic forms did.

We present a focused position piece that illustrates the many different tests that a cell makes of its environment before it establishes mature matrix adhesions. When a fibroblast is placed on fibronectin-coated glass surfaces at 37°C, it typically spreads and polarizes within 20-40 min primarily through αvβ3 integrin binding to fibronectin. In that short period, the cell goes through three major phases that involve binding, integrin activation, spreading, and mechanical testing of the surface. The advantage of using the model system of cell spreading from the unattached state is that it is highly reproducible and the stages that the cell undergoes can thus be studied in a highly quantitative manner, in both space and time. The mechanical and biochemical parameters that matter in this example are often surprising because of both the large number of tests that occur and the precision of the tests. We discuss our current understanding of those tests, the decision tree that is involved in this process, and an extension to the behavior of the cells at longer time periods when mature adhesions develop. Because many other matrices and integrins are involved in cell-matrix adhesion, this model system gives us a limited view of a subset of cellular behaviors that can occur. However, by defining one cellular process at a molecular level, we know more of what to expect when defining other processes. Because each cellular process will involve some different proteins, a molecular understanding of multiple functions operating within a given cell can lead to strategies to selectively block a function.",

Damage identification is a challenge for all DNA damage response proteins, but especially for nucleases that cut the DNA and necessarily create a cleaved DNA repair intermediate, likely more toxic than the initial damage. How do these enzymes achieve exquisite specificity without specific sequence recognition or, in some cases, without a non-canonical DNA nucleotide? Combined structural, biochemical, and biological analyses of repair nucleases are revealing their molecular tools for damage verification and safeguarding against inadvertent incision. Surprisingly, these enzymes also often act on RNA, which deserves more attention. Here, we review protein-DNA structures for nucleases involved in replication, base excision repair, mismatch repair, double strand break repair (DSBR), and telomere maintenance: apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), Endonuclease IV (Nfo), tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase (TDP2), UV Damage endonuclease (UVDE), very short patch repair endonuclease (Vsr), Endonuclease V (Nfi), Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), exonuclease 1 (Exo1), RNase T and Meiotic recombination 11 (Mre11). DNA and RNA structure-sensing nucleases are essential to life with roles in DNA replication, repair, and transcription. Increasingly these enzymes are employed as advanced tools for synthetic biology and as targets for cancer prognosis and interventions. Currently their structural biology is most fully illuminated for DNA repair, which is also essential to life. How DNA repair enzymes maintain genome fidelity is one of the DNA double helix secrets missed by Watson-Crick, that is only now being illuminated though structural biology and mutational analyses. Structures reveal motifs for repair nucleases and mechanisms whereby these enzymes follow the old carpenter adage: measure twice, cut once. Furthermore, to measure twice these nucleases act as molecular level transformers that typically reshape the DNA and sometimes themselves to achieve extraordinary specificity and efficiency.",Exonuclease;Enzyme–DNA complex;Genome maintenance;Crystallography;Structure-specific nuclease;DNase;RNase;Nucleases;DNA;RNA;Endonucleases;Metals;Magnesium;Zinc;Manganese;DNA repair;Base excision repair;Mismatch repair;Double strand break repair;Nucleotide Incision Repair;Telomere;APE1;Nfo;EndoIV;TDP2;UVDE;Vsr;Nfi;EndoV;Mre11;FEN1;Exo1

Although capsules are often associated with descriptions of pathogenic bacteria due to the large proportion of encapsulated invasive pathogens, non-pathogenic and commensal bacteria also benefit from the ability to envelope themselves with a capsule (Hafez et al., 2009; Dasgupta & Kasper, 2010). In Gram-negative bacteria, capsular polysaccharides are often attached to the outer membrane at their reducing end through covalently-linked lipids that are inserted into the lipid bilayer of the membrane.

In some cases, such circles actually bind host microRNAs. Such depletion of available microRNAs appears to have biological roles; for instance, in homeostasis and disease. These findings regarding host RNA circles support a speculative reappraisal of the origin and mode of replication of hepatitis delta virus, hepatitis delta virus (HDV), an agent with a small circular RNA genome; specifically, it is proposed that in hepatocytes infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), some viral RNA species are processed to circular forms, which by a series of chance events lead to an RNA that can be both replicated by host enzymes and assembled, using HBV envelope proteins, to form particles some of which are infectious. Such a model also may provide some new insights into the potential pathogenic potential of HDV infections. In return, new insights into HDV might provide information leading to a better understanding of the roles of the host RNA circles.",Hepatitis B virus;Hepatitis delta virus;Circular RNA;Ribozymes;MicroRNA

This group forms calcium oxalate renal stones without any systemic symptoms, which contributes to the difficulty of understanding and treating this painful and recurring disease. Thus, the development of an in vitro model system to study idiopathic nephrolithiasis, beginning with RP pathogenesis, can help in identifying how plaques, and subsequently stones, form. One main theory of RP formation is that calcium phosphate deposits initially form in the basement membrane of the thin loops of Henle, which then fuse and spread into the interstitial tissue, and ultimately make their way across the urothelium, where upon exposure to the urine, the mineralized tissue serves as a nidus for overgrowth with calcium oxalate into a stone. Our group has found that many of the unusual morphologies found in RP and stones, such as concentrically-laminated spherulites and mineralized collagenous tissue, can be reproduced in vitro using a polymer-induced liquid-precursor (PILP) process, in which acidic polypeptides induce a liquid-phase amorphous precursor to the mineral, yielding non-equilibrium crystal morphologies. Given that there are many acidic proteins and polysaccharides present in the renal tissue and urine, we have put for the hypothesis that the PILP system may be involved in urolithiasis. Therefore, our goal is to develop an in vitro model system of these two stages of composite stone formation in order to study the role that various acidic macromolecules may play. In our initial experiments presented here, the development of “biomimetic” RP was investigated, which will then serve as a nidus for calcium oxalate overgrowth studies. In order to mimic the tissue environment, MatriStem® (ACell, Inc.), a decellularized porcine urinary bladder matrix was used, because it has both an intact epithelial basement membrane surface and a tunica propria layer, thus providing the two types of matrix constituents found associated with mineral in the early stages of RP formation. We found that when using the PILP process to mineralize this tissue matrix, the two sides led to dramatically different mineral textures, and they bore a striking resemblance to native RP, which was not seen in the tissue mineralized via the classical crystal nucleation and growth process. The interstitium side predominantly consisted of collagen associated mineral, while the luminal side had much less mineral, which appeared to be tiny spherules embedded within the basement membrane. Although these studies are only preliminary, they support our hypothesis that kidney stones may involve non-classical crystallization pathways induced by the large variety of macromolecular species in the urinary environment. We believe that mineralization of native tissue scaffolds is useful for developing a model system of stone formation, with the ultimate goal of developing strategies to avoid RP and its detrimental consequences in stone formation, or developing therapeutic treatments to prevent or cure the disease.

dynamics of polypeptides and proteins
is critical in characterizing their functions in biological systems.
Numerous computational models and methods have been developed for
studying structure formation at the atomic level. Due to its small
size and simple structure, deca-alanine is used as a model system
in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The free energy of unfolding
in vacuum has been studied extensively using the end-to-end distance
of the peptide as the reaction coordinate. However, few studies have
been conducted in the presence of explicit solvent. Previous results
show a significant decrease in the free energy of extended conformations
in water, but the α-helical state is still notably favored over
the extended state. Although sufficient in vacuum, we show that end-to-end
distance is incapable of capturing the full complexity of deca-alanine
folding in water. Using α-helical content as a second reaction
coordinate, we deduce a more descriptive free-energy landscape, one
which reveals a second energy minimum in the extended conformations
that is of comparable free energy to the α-helical state. Equilibrium
simulations demonstrate the relative stability of the extended and
α-helical states in water as well as the transition between
the two states. This work reveals both the necessity and challenge
of determining a proper reaction coordinate to fully characterize
a given process.",

Assuming a crucial role of amyloid-Aβ in neurodegeneration, we hypothesized that both A2V and A2T mutations cause distinct changes in Aβ properties that may at least partially explain these completely different phenotypes. Using human APP-overexpressing primary neurons, we observed significantly decreased Aβ production in the A2T mutant along with an enhanced Aβ generation in the A2V mutant confirming earlier data from non-neuronal cell lines. More importantly, thioflavin T fluorescence assays revealed that the mutations, while having little effect on Aβ42 peptide aggregation, dramatically change the properties of the Aβ40 pool with A2V accelerating and A2T delaying aggregation of the Aβ peptides. In line with the kinetic data, Aβ A2T demonstrated an increase in the solubility at equilibrium, an effect that was also observed in all mixtures of the A2T mutant with the wild type Aβ40. We propose that in addition to the reduced β-secretase cleavage of APP, the impaired propensity to aggregate may be part of the protective effect conferred by A2T substitution. The interpretation of the protective effect of this mutation is thus much more complicated than proposed previously.",Aggregation;Alzheimer Disease;Amyloid-β (Aβ);Kinetics;Thermodynamics

While vinculin interacts with many adhesion proteins, its interaction with filamentous actin regulates cell morphology, motility, and mechanotransduction. Disruption of this interaction lowers cell traction forces and enhances actin flow rates. Although a model for the vinculin:actin complex exists, we recently identified actin-binding deficient mutants of vinculin outside sites predicted to bind actin, and developed an alternative model to better define this novel actin-binding surface, using negative-stain EM, discrete molecular dynamics, and mutagenesis. Actin-binding deficient vinculin variants expressed in vinculin knockout fibroblasts fail to rescue cell-spreading defects and reduce cellular response to external force. These findings highlight the importance of this new actin-binding surface and provide the molecular basis for elucidating additional roles of this interaction, including actin-induced conformational changes which promote actin bundling.",

To understand how SK channels operate, it is necessary to determine how Ca2+ regulates CaM binding to its target on SK. Tagless, recombinant SK peptide (SKp), was purified for binding studies with CaM at low and high Ca2+ concentrations. Composition gradient multi-angle light scattering accurately measures the molar mass, stoichiometry, and affinity of protein complexes. In 2 mM Ca2+, SKp and CaM bind with three different stoichiometries that depend on the molar ratio of SKp:CaM in solution. These complexes include 28 kD 1SKp/1CaM, 39 kD 2SKp/1CaM, and 44 kD 1SKp/2CaM. A 2SKp/2CaM complex, observed in prior crystallographic studies, is absent. At <5 nM Ca2+, 1SKp/1CaM and 2SKp/1CaM were observed; however, 1SKp/2CaM was absent. Analytical ultracentrifugation was used to characterize the physical properties of the three SKp/CaM stoichiometries. In high Ca2+, the sedimentation coefficient is smaller for a 1SKp:1CaM solution than it is for either 2SKp:1CaM or 1SKp:2CaM. At low Ca2+ and at >100 µM protein concentrations, a molar excess of SKp over CaM causes aggregation. Aggregation is not observed in Ca2+ or with CaM in molar excess. In low Ca2+ both 1SKp:1CaM and 1SKp:2CaM solutions have similar sedimentation coefficients, which is consistent with the absence of a 1SKp/2CaM complex in low Ca2+. These results suggest that complexes with stoichiometries other than 2SKp/2CaM are important in gating.",

Although the structure of this tract in the large mature aggregates is increasingly well described, its structure in the small early aggregates remains largely unknown. As experimental evidence suggests that the most toxic species along the aggregation pathway are the small early ones, developing strategies to alleviate disease pathology calls for understanding the structure of polyglutamine peptides in the early stages of aggregation. Here, we present a criterion, grounded in available experimental data, that allows for using kinetic stability of dimers to assess whether a given polyglutamine conformer can be on the aggregation path. We then demonstrate that this criterion can be assessed using present-day molecular dynamics simulations. We find that although the α-helical conformer of polyglutamine is very stable, dimers of α-helices lack the kinetic stability necessary to support further oligomerization. Dimers of steric zipper, β-nanotube, and β-pseudohelix conformers are also too short-lived to initiate aggregation. The β-hairpin-containing conformers, instead, invariably form very stable dimers when their side chains are interdigitated. Combining these findings with the implications of recent solid-state NMR data on mature fibrils, we propose a possible pathway for the initial stages of polyglutamine aggregation, in which β-hairpin-containing conformers act as templates for fibril formation.",

In Arabidopsis thaliana, one of the most central members of this family is SEPALLATA3 (SEP3), which is involved in many aspects of plant reproduction, including floral meristem and floral organ development. SEP3 has been shown to form homo and heterooligomeric complexes with other MADS domain transcription factors through its intervening (I) and keratin-like (K) domains. SEP3 function depends on its ability to form specific protein-protein complexes; however, the atomic level determinants of oligomerization are poorly understood. Here, we report the 2.5-Å crystal structure of a small portion of the intervening and the complete keratin-like domain of SEP3. The domains form two amphipathic alpha helices separated by a rigid kink, which prevents intramolecular association and presents separate dimerization and tetramerization interfaces comprising predominantly hydrophobic patches. Mutations to the tetramerization interface demonstrate the importance of highly conserved hydrophobic residues for tetramer stability. Atomic force microscopy was used to show SEP3-DNA interactions and the role of oligomerization in DNA binding and conformation. Based on these data, the oligomerization patterns of the larger family of MADS domain transcription factors can be predicted and manipulated based on the primary sequence.",

Their role in the pathogenesis of these conditions is not yet clear mainly due to the lack of proper models of aggregation that may allow the study of the mechanism of formation, their interactions with other cellular components and their effect on the cell metabolism. In this work, we have used tandem repeats of the prion like Q/N-rich region of TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) fused to additional TDP-43 protein sequences to trigger aggregate formation in neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines. At the functional level, these aggregates are able to sequester endogenous TDP-43 depleting its nuclear levels and inducing loss of function at the pre-mRNA splicing level. No apparent direct cellular toxicity of the aggregates seems to be present beyond the lack of functional TDP-43. To our knowledge, this is the only system that achieves full functional TDP 43 depletion with effects similar to RNAi depletion or gene deletion. As a result, this model will prove useful to investigate the loss-of-function effects mediated by TDP-43 aggregation within cells without affecting the expression of the endogenous gene. We have identified the N-terminus sequence of TDP-43 as the domain that enhances its interaction with the aggregates and its insolubilization. These data show for the first time that cellular TDP-43 aggregation can lead to total loss of function and to defective splicing of TDP-43-dependent splicing events in endogenous genes.",

Here, we provide the first biochemical and structural insights into the molecular architecture of this large multiprotein assembly. We identified several direct interactions within the complex and show that KANSL1 acts as a scaffold protein interacting with four other subunits, including WDR5, which in turn binds KANSL2. Structural analysis of the KANSL1/WDR5/KANSL2 subcomplex reveals how WDR5 is recruited into the NSL complex via conserved linear motifs of KANSL1 and KANSL2. Using structure-based KANSL1 mutants in transgenic flies, we show that the KANSL1–WDR5 interaction is required for proper assembly, efficient recruitment of the NSL complex to target promoters, and fly viability. Our data clearly show that the interactions of WDR5 with the MOF-containing NSL complex and MLL/COMPASS histone methyltransferase complexes are mutually exclusive. We propose that rather than being a shared subunit, WDR5 plays an important role in assembling distinct histone-modifying complexes with different epigenetic regulatory roles.",chromatin;epigenetics;histone acetylation

Some of the mechanisms used to ensure cellular preservation during severe dehydration appear to be peculiar to resurrection plants. Apart from the ability to preserve vital cellular components during drying and rehydration, such mechanisms include the ability to down-regulate growth-related metabolism rapidly in response to changes in water availability, and the ability to inhibit dehydration-induced senescence programs enabling reconstitution of photosynthetic capacity quickly following a rainfall event. Extensive research on the molecular mechanism of leaf senescence in non-resurrection plants has revealed a multi-layered regulatory network operates to control programed cell death pathways. However, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms that resurrection plants employ to avoid undergoing drought-related senescence during the desiccation process. To survive desiccation, dehydration in the perennial resurrection grass S. stapfianus must proceed slowly over a period of 7 days or more. Leaves detached from the plant before 60% relative water content (RWC) is attained are desiccation-sensitive indicating that desiccation tolerance is conferred in vegetative tissue of S. stapfianus when the leaf RWC has declined to 60%. Whilst some older leaves remaining attached to the plant during dehydration will senesce, suggesting dehydration-induced senescence may be influenced by leaf age or the rate of dehydration in individual leaves, the majority of leaves do not senesce. Rather these leaves dehydrate to air-dryness and revive fully following rehydration. Hence it seems likely that there are genes expressed in younger leaf tissues of resurrection plants that enable suppression of drought-related senescence pathways. As very few studies have directly addressed this phenomenon, this review aims to discuss current literature surrounding the activation and suppression of senescence pathways and how these pathways may differ in resurrection plants.",desiccation tolerance;senescence;drought;Sporobolus stapfianus;photosynthesis

The two activation domains of E2A, AD1 and AD2, display redundant, independent, and cooperative functions in a cell-dependent manner. AD1 of E2A functions by binding the transcriptional co-activator CBP/p300; this interaction is required in oncogenesis and occurs between the conserved ϕ-x-x-ϕ-ϕ motif in AD1 and the KIX domain of CBP/p300. However, co-activator recruitment by AD2 has not been characterized. Here, we demonstrate that the first of two conserved ϕ-x-x-ϕ-ϕ motifs within AD2 of E2A interacts at the same binding site on KIX as AD1. Mutagenesis uncovered a correspondence between the KIX-binding affinity of AD2 and transcriptional activation. Although AD2 is dispensable for oncogenesis, experimentally increasing the affinity of AD2 for KIX uncovered a latent potential to mediate immortalization of primary hematopoietic progenitors by E2A-PBX1. Our findings suggest that redundancy between the two E2A activation domains with respect to transcriptional activation and oncogenic function is mediated by binding to the same surface of the KIX domain of CBP/p300.",

Indeed, 4 of 11 enzymes of this cycle are activated in the light through dithiol/disulfide interchanges controlled by chloroplastic thioredoxin. Recently, several proteomics-based approaches suggested that not only four but all enzymes of the Calvin-Benson cycle may withstand redox regulation. Here, we characterized the redox features of the Calvin-Benson enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1) from the eukaryotic green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and we show that C. reinhardtii PGK1 (CrPGK1) activity is inhibited by the formation of a single regulatory disulfide bond with a low midpoint redox potential (−335 mV at pH 7.9). CrPGK1 oxidation was found to affect the turnover number without altering the affinity for substrates, whereas the enzyme activation appeared to be specifically controlled by f-type thioredoxin. Using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, thiol titration, mass spectrometry analyses, and three-dimensional modeling, the regulatory disulfide bond was shown to involve the not strictly conserved Cys227 and Cys361. Based on molecular mechanics calculation, the formation of the disulfide is proposed to impose structural constraints in the C-terminal domain of the enzyme that may lower its catalytic efficiency. It is therefore concluded that CrPGK1 might constitute an additional light-modulated Calvin-Benson cycle enzyme with a low activity in the dark and a TRX-dependent activation in the light. These results are also discussed from an evolutionary point of view.",Chlamydomonas;Chloroplast;Disulfide;Photosynthesis;Redox Signaling;Thiol;Thioredoxin;Calvin-Benson Cycle;Phosphoglycerate Kinase

To investigate the major principles of gene expression regulation in dynamic systems, we estimated protein synthesis and degradation rates from parallel time series data of mRNA and protein expression and tested the degree to which expression changes can be modeled by a set of simple linear differential equations. Examining three published datasets for yeast responding to diamide, rapamycin, and sodium chloride treatment, we find that almost one-third of genes can be well-modeled, and the estimated rates assume realistic values. Prediction quality is linked to low measurement noise and the shape of the expression profile. Synthesis and degradation rates do not correlate within one treatment, consistent with their independent regulation. When performing robustness analyses of the rate estimates, we observed that most genes adhere to one of two major modes of regulation, which we term synthesis- and degradation-independent regulation. These two modes, in which only one of the rates has to be tightly set, while the other one can assume various values, offer an efficient way for the cell to respond to stimuli and re-establish proteostasis. We experimentally validate degradation-independent regulation under oxidative stress for the heatshock protein Ssa4.",

Nezis","The large-scale turnover of intracellular material including organelles is achieved by autophagy-mediated degradation in lysosomes. Initiation of autophagy is controlled by a protein kinase complex consisting of an Atg1-family kinase, Atg13, FIP200/Atg17, and the metazoan-specific subunit Atg101. Here we show that loss of Atg101 impairs both starvation-induced and basal autophagy in Drosophila. This leads to accumulation of protein aggregates containing the selective autophagy cargo ref(2)P/p62. Mapping experiments suggest that Atg101 binds to the N-terminal HORMA domain of Atg13 and may also interact with two unstructured regions of Atg1. Another HORMA domain-containing protein, Mad2, forms a conformational homodimer. We show that Drosophila Atg101 also dimerizes, and it is predicted to fold into a HORMA domain. Atg101 interacts with ref(2)P as well, similar to Atg13, Atg8a, Atg16, Atg18, Keap1, and RagC, a known regulator of Tor kinase which coordinates cell growth and autophagy. These results raise the possibility that the interactions and dimerization of the putative HORMA domain protein Atg101 play critical roles in starvation-induced autophagy and proteostasis, by promoting the formation of protein aggregate-containing autophagosomes.",

We have previously shown that microtubule (MT) capture by CLASP2, a MT plus-end-tracking protein (+TIP), increases the size and receptor density of AChR clusters at the NMJ through the delivery of AChRs and that this is regulated by a pathway involving neuronal agrin and several postsynaptic kinases, including GSK3. Phosphorylation by GSK3 has been shown to cause CLASP2 dissociation from MT ends, and nine potential phosphorylation sites for GSK3 have been mapped on CLASP2. How CLASP2 phosphorylation regulates MT capture at the NMJ and how this controls the size of AChR clusters are not yet understood. To examine this, we used myotubes cultured on agrin patches that induce AChR clustering in a two-dimensional manner. We show that expression of a CLASP2 mutant, in which the nine GSK3 target serines are mutated to alanine (CLASP2–9XS/9XA) and are resistant to GSK3β-dependent phosphorylation, promotes MT capture at clusters and increases AChR cluster size, compared with myotubes that express similar levels of wild type CLASP2 or that are noninfected. Conversely, myotubes expressing a phosphomimetic form of CLASP2 (CLASP2–8XS/D) show enrichment of immobile mutant CLASP2 in clusters, but MT capture and AChR cluster size are reduced. Taken together, our data suggest that both GSK3β-dependent phosphorylation and the level of CLASP2 play a role in the maintenance of AChR cluster size through the regulated capture and release of MT plus-ends.",Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK-3);Microtubule;Microtubule-associated Protein (MAP);Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors (nAChR);Synapse

Here we design structure-based mutations in Pyrococcus furiosus Rad50 to alter protein core plasticity and residues undergoing ATP-driven movements within the catalytic domains. With this strategy we identify Rad50 separation-of-function mutants that either promote or destabilize the ATP-bound state. Crystal structures, X-ray scattering, biochemical assays, and functional analyses of mutant PfRad50 complexes show that the ATP-induced ‘closed’ conformation promotes DNA end binding and end tethering, while hydrolysis-induced opening is essential for DNA resection. Reducing the stability of the ATP-bound state impairs DNA repair and Tel1 (ATM) checkpoint signaling in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, double-strand break resection in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and ATM activation by human Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 in vitro, supporting the generality of the P. furiosus Rad50 structure-based mutational analyses.

Hepatitis C virus infection causes acute and chronic liver disease, including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In fact, hepatitis C virus infection is the most frequent indication for liver transplantation and a vaccine is not available. Hepatitis C virus displays a narrow host species tropism, naturally infecting only humans, although chimpanzees are also susceptible to experimental infection. To date, there is no evidence for an animal reservoir of viruses closely related to hepatitis C virus which may have crossed the species barrier to cause disease in humans and resulted in the current pandemic. In fact, due to this restricted host range, a robust immunocompetent small animal model is still lacking, hampering mechanistic analysis of virus pathogenesis, immune control and prophylactic vaccine development. Recently, several studies discovered new viruses related to hepatitis C virus, belonging to the hepaci- and pegivirus genera, in small wild mammals (rodents and bats) and domesticated animals which live in close contact with humans (dogs and horses). Genetic and biological characterization of these newly discovered hepatitis C virus-like viruses infecting different mammals will contribute to our understanding of the origins of hepatitis C virus in humans and enhance our ability to study pathogenesis and immune responses using tractable animal models. In this review article, we start with an introduction on the genetic diversity of hepatitis C virus and then focus on the newly discovered viruses closely related to hepatitis C virus.

It has been shown that overproduction of a prion protein Swi1 can promote the de novo conversion of another yeast prion [PSI+] when Sup35 is co-overproduced. However, the mechanism underlying this Pin+ ([PSI+] inducible) activity is not clear. Moreover, how the Swi1 prion ([SWI+]) interacts with other yeast prions is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the Pin+ activity associated with Swi1 overproduction is independent of Rnq1 expression or [PIN+] conversion. We also show that [SWI+] enhances the appearance of [PSI+] and [PIN+]. However, [SWI+] significantly compromises the Pin+ activity of [PIN+] when they coexist. We further demonstrate that a single yeast cell can harbor three prions, [PSI+], [PIN+], and [SWI+], simultaneously. However, under this condition, [SWI+] is significantly destabilized. While the propensity to aggregate underlies prionogenesis, Swi1 and Rnq1 aggregates resulting from overproduction are usually nonheritable. Conversely, prion protein aggregates formed in nonoverexpressing conditions or induced by preexisting prion(s) are more prionogenic. For [PSI+] and [PIN+] de novo formation, heterologous “facilitators,” such as preexisting [SWI+] aggregates, colocalize only with the newly formed ring-/rod-shaped Sup35 or Rnq1 aggregates, but not with the dot-shaped mature prion aggregates. Their colocalization frequency is coordinated with their prion inducibility, indicating that prion–prion interactions mainly occur at the early initiation stage. Our results provide supportive evidence for the cross-seeding model of prionogenesis and highlight a complex interaction network among prions in yeast.",Saccharomyces cerevisiae;protein aggregation;prionogenesis;prion interactions;[SWI+]

Here, using amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic variants of β2-microglobulin, we identify the interactions that inhibit or promote fibril formation in atomic detail. The results reveal that different outcomes of assembly result from biomolecular interactions involving similar surfaces. Specifically, inhibition occurs via rigid body docking of monomers in a head-to-head orientation to form kinetically trapped dimers. By contrast, the promotion of fibrillation involves relatively weak protein association in a similar orientation, which results in conformational changes in the initially nonfibrillogenic partner. The results highlight the complexity of interactions early in amyloid assembly and reveal atomic-level information about species barriers in amyloid formation.",

Recent genome efforts have disclosed that tunicates are also remarkable in their genome organization and molecular evolutionary patterns. Here, we review these latter aspects, comparing the similarities and specificities of two model species of the group: Oikopleura dioica and Ciona intestinalis. These species exhibit great genome plasticity and Oikopleura in particular has undergone a process of extreme genome reduction and compaction that can be explained in part by gene loss, but is mostly due to other mechanisms such as shortening of intergenic distances and introns, and scarcity of mobile elements. In Ciona, genome reorganization was less severe being more similar to the other chordates in several aspects. Rates and patterns of molecular evolution are also peculiar in tunicates, being Ciona about 50% faster than vertebrates and Oikopleura three times faster. In fact, the latter species is considered as the fastest evolving metazoan recorded so far. Two processes of increase in evolutionary rates have taken place in tunicates. One of them is more extreme, and basically restricted to genes encoding regulatory proteins (transcription regulators, chromatin remodeling proteins, and metabolic regulators), and the other one is less pronounced but affects the whole genome. Very likely adaptive evolution has played a very significant role in the first, whereas the functional and/or evolutionary causes of the second are less clear and the evidence is not conclusive. The evidences supporting the incidence of increased mutation and less efficient negative selection are presented and discussed.",positive selection;genome plasticity;Oikopleura dioica;Ciona

Homozygous Baf155mps3 embryos exhibit highly penetrant exencephaly, allowing us to investigate the roles of an assembled, but malfunctional BAF chromatin remodeling complex in vivo at the time of neural tube closure. Evidence of defects in proliferation and apoptosis were found within the neural tube. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that surprisingly few genes showed altered expression in Baf155 mutant neural tissue, given the broad epigenetic role of the BAF complex, but included genes involved in neural development and cell survival. Moreover, gene expression changes between individual mutants were variable even though the NTD was consistently observed. This suggests that inconsistent gene regulation contributes to failed neural tube closure.

Our results show that the cross-parametrization can reproduce a number of structural properties of membrane peptides (for example, tilt and hydrophobic mismatch), in agreement with existing peptide-lipid CG force fields. We find encouraging results for two challenging biophysical problems: (i) membrane pore formation mediated by the cooperative action of several antimicrobial peptides, and (ii) the insertion and folding of the helix-forming peptide WALP23 in the membrane.",

The solution properties and aggregation behavior of α-synuclein has been well characterized, but despite numerous studies that address the role of α-synuclein in cells, a clear physiological function of this protein remains a mystery. Over a hundred review articles of α-synuclein have been written in the last decade, making it difficult to list all of the important studies that have added to our insight of α-synuclein physiology. Instead, we briefly review the status of α-synuclein research and propose a model based on the idea that α-synuclein may not have an intrinsic activity in cells but rather, it modifies the function of a group of protein partners that in turn affect cell processes. We propose that it is the loss of its cellular partners under oxidative conditions that promotes α-synuclein aggregation accelerating neuronal death.",α-synuclein;protein aggregation;oxidative stress;phospholipase C

However, ubiquitin contains a high surface density of lysine residues and the doctrine of surface-entropy reduction suggests that these lysines will resist participating in packing interactions and thereby impede crystallization. To assess the contributions of these residues to crystallization behavior, each of the seven lysines of ubiquitin was mutated to serine and the corresponding single-site mutant proteins were expressed and purified. The behavior of these seven mutants was then compared with that of the wild-type protein in a 384-condition crystallization screen. The likelihood of obtaining crystals varied by two orders of magnitude within this set of eight proteins. Some mutants crystallized much more readily than the wild type, while others crystallized less readily. X-ray crystal structures were determined for three readily crystallized variants: K11S, K33S and the K11S/K63S double mutant. These structures revealed that the mutant serine residues can directly promote crystallization by participating in favorable packing interactions; the mutations can also exert permissive effects, wherein crystallization appears to be driven by removal of the lysine rather than by addition of a serine. Presumably, such permissive effects reflect the elimination of steric and electrostatic barriers to crystallization.",ubiquitin;surface-entropy reduction

The C terminus and a channel able to function are necessary, and neither by itself is sufficient, for Cx37 to mediate growth suppression. Cx37 supports transmembrane and intercellular signaling by forming functional hemichannels (HCs) and gap junction channels (GJCs), respectively. Here we determined whether Cx37 with HC, but not GJC, functionality would suppress proliferation of rat insulinoma (Rin) cells comparably to wild-type Cx37 (Cx37-WT). We mutated extracellular loop residues hypothesized to compromise HC docking but not HC function (six cysteines mutated to alanine, C54A,C61A,C65A, C187A,C192A,C198A (designated as C6A); N55I; and Q58L). All three mutants trafficked to the plasma membrane and formed protein plaques comparably to Cx37-WT. None of the mutants formed functional GJCs, and Cx37-C6A did not form functional HCs. Cx37-N55I and -Q58L formed HCs with behavior and permeation properties similar to Cx37-WT (especially Q58L), but none of the mutants suppressed Rin cell proliferation. The data indicate that determinants of Cx37 HC function differ from other Cxs and that HC functions with associated HC-supported protein-protein interactions are not sufficient for Cx37 to suppress Rin cell proliferation. Together with previously published data, these results suggest that Cx37 suppresses Rin cell proliferation only when in a specific conformation achieved by interaction of the C terminus with a Cx37 pore-forming domain able to open as a GJC.",Cell-Cell Interaction;Connexin;Gap Junction;Proliferation;Protein Targeting;Arterial Endothelium;Cell Cycle Control;Hemichannel;Intercellular Communication

While initiation at GUG and UUG is permitted in prokaryotes (Archaea and Bacteria), cases of CUG initiation were recently reported in human cells. The varying stringency in translation initiation between eukaryotic and prokaryotic domains largely stems from a fundamental problem for the ribosome in recognizing a codon at the peptidyl-tRNA binding site. Initiation factors specific to each domain of life evolved to confer stringent initiation by the ribosome. The mechanistic basis for high accuracy in eukaryotic initiation is described based on recent findings concerning the role of the multifactor complex (MFC) in this process.

Controlled generation of ROS in normal cells serves useful purposes to regulate important cellular processes such as cell proliferation, inflammation, and immune response, but overproduction of ROS causes oxidative stress that contributes to the development of cancer, chronic disease, and aging. These hugely different consequences of ROS exposure demand a carefully balanced control of ROS production and disposition, which is largely achieved through the body’s elaborate antioxidant system. The human antioxidant system consists of small antioxidants, antioxidant proteins, ROS-metabolizing enzymes, as well as many regulator proteins that mediate adaptive responses to oxidant stress. How such a complex system reacts with oxidants and achieves the required specificity and sensitivity for proper anti-oxidation is incompletely understood. In this respect, new advances in the understanding of the chemistry that determines the reaction of a given oxidant or antioxidant with a protein target provide considerable insights into these and related questions. The findings hold certain promise for new drug development for preventing and treating diseases associated with oxidant tissue damage.",

Recently, substitution of histidine 50 in αSyn with a glutamine, H50Q, was identified as a new familial PD mutant. Here, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies revealed that the H50Q substitution causes an increase of the flexibility of the C-terminal region. This finding provides direct evidence that this PD-causing mutant can mediate long range effects on the sampling of αSyn conformations. In vitro aggregation assays showed that substitution of His-50 with Gln, Asp, or Ala promotes αSyn aggregation, whereas substitution with the positively charged Arg suppresses αSyn aggregation. Histidine carries a partial positive charge at neutral pH, and so our result suggests that positively charged His-50 plays a role in protecting αSyn from aggregation under physiological conditions.",Mutant;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance;Parkinson Disease;Protein Aggregation;Synuclein

The full-length structure visualises at atomic resolution the N-terminal HerA-ATP Synthase (HAS) domain and a conserved C-terminal extension, which acts as a physical brace between adjacent protomers. The brace also interacts in trans with nucleotide-binding residues of the neighbouring subunit. Our observations support a model in which the coaxial interaction of the HerA ring with the toroidal NurA dimer generates a continuous channel traversing the complex. HerA-driven translocation would propel the DNA towards the narrow annulus of NurA, leading to duplex melting and nucleolytic digestion.

The four-domain staphylococcal immunoglobulin binding (Sbi) protein interacts with complement component 3 (C3) and its thioester domain (C3d)-containing fragments. Recent structural data suggested two possible modes of binding of Sbi domain IV (Sbi-IV) to C3d, but the physiological binding mode remains unclear. We used a computational approach to provide insight into the C3d-Sbi-IV interaction. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that the first binding mode (PDB code 2WY8) is more robust than the second (PDB code 2WY7), with more persistent polar and nonpolar interactions, as well as conserved interfacial solvent accessible surface area. Brownian dynamics and steered MD simulations revealed that the first binding mode has faster association kinetics and maintains more stable intermolecular interactions compared to the second binding mode. In light of available experimental and structural data, our data confirm that the first binding mode represents Sbi-IV interaction with C3d (and C3) in a physiological context. Although the second binding mode is inherently less stable, we suggest a possible physiological role. Both binding sites may serve as a template for structure-based design of novel complement therapeutics.",

The estrogenic property of EDCs has thus shown many associations between ongoing exposures and the development of endocrine-related diseases, including breast cancer. The environment consists of a heterogenous population of EDCs and despite many identified modes of action, including that of altering the epigenome, drawing definitive correlations regarding breast cancer has been a point of much discussion. In this review, we describe in detail well-characterized EDCs and their actions in the environment, their ability to disrupt mammary gland formation in animal and human experimental models and their associations with exposure and breast cancer risk.

The most common mutation, G2019S, resides in the kinase domain and enhances activity. LRRK2 possesses the unique property of cis-autophosphorylation of its own GTPase domain. Because high-resolution structures of the human LRRK2 kinase domain are not available, we used novel high-throughput assays that measured both cis-autophosphorylation and trans-peptide phosphorylation to probe the ATP-binding pocket. We disclose hundreds of commercially available activity-selective LRRK2 kinase inhibitors. Some compounds inhibit cis-autophosphorylation more strongly than trans-peptide phosphorylation, and other compounds inhibit G2019S-LRRK2 more strongly than WT-LRRK2. Through exploitation of structure-activity relationships revealed through high-throughput analyses, we identified a useful probe inhibitor, SRI-29132 (11). SRI-29132 is exquisitely selective for LRRK2 kinase activity and is effective in attenuating proinflammatory responses in macrophages and rescuing neurite retraction phenotypes in neurons. Furthermore, the compound demonstrates excellent potency, is highly blood-brain barrier-permeant, but suffers from rapid first-pass metabolism. Despite the observed selectivity of SRI-29132, docking models highlighted critical interactions with residues conserved in many protein kinases, implying a unique structural configuration for the LRRK2 ATP-binding pocket. Although the human LRRK2 kinase domain is unstable and insoluble, we demonstrate that the LRRK2 homolog from ameba can be mutated to approximate some aspects of the human LRRK2 ATP-binding pocket. Our results provide a rich resource for LRRK2 small molecule inhibitor development. More broadly, our results provide a precedent for the functional interrogation of ATP-binding pockets when traditional approaches to ascertain structure prove difficult.",High-throughput Screening (HTS);Leucine-rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2);Neurodegeneration;Protein Kinase;Recombinant Protein Expression;Alphascreen;Park8;Kinase Inhibitor

The NNS complex terminates transcription of noncoding RNA genes and promotes exosome-dependent processing/degradation of the released transcripts. The Trf4-Air2-Mtr4 (TRAMP) complex polyadenylates NNS target RNAs and favors their degradation. NNS-dependent termination and degradation are coupled, but the mechanism underlying this coupling remains enigmatic. Here we provide structural and functional evidence demonstrating that the same domain of Nrd1p interacts with RNA polymerase II and Trf4p in a mutually exclusive manner, thus defining two alternative forms of the NNS complex, one involved in termination and the other in degradation. We show that the Nrd1-Trf4 interaction is required for optimal exosome activity in vivo and for the stimulation of polyadenylation of NNS targets by TRAMP in vitro. We propose that transcription termination and RNA degradation are coordinated by switching between two alternative partners of the NNS complex.",

In order to increase its expression and activity, we produced tobacco plants expressing KGF1 via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation using a potato virus X (PVX)-based vector (pgR107). The vector contained the sequence encoding the KGF1 gene fused with a green florescence protein. The recombinant plasmid was introduced into leaf cells of Nicotiana benthamiana (a wild Australian tobacco) via Agrobacterium-mediated agroinfiltration. As determined by fluorescence and Western blot of leaf extracts, the KGF1 gene was correctly translated into the tobacco plants. The recombinant KGF1 was purified from plant tissues by heparin affinity chromatography, and cell proliferation in NIH/3T3 cells was stimulated by the purified KGF1. The purified KGF1 was also applied to the wounds of type-II diabetic rats. KGF1 had accumulated to levels as high as 530 μg/g fresh weight in the leaves of agroinfected plants. We show that plant-derived KGF1 can promote the proliferation of NIH/3T3 cells and have significant effects on the type-II diabetic rat. The present findings indicated that KGF1 from tobacco maintains its biological activity, implying prospective industrial production in a plant bioreactor.",

Although PPIs were considered as attractive pharmaceutical targets already some years ago, they have been thus far largely unexploited for therapeutic interventions with low molecular weight compounds. Several limiting factors, from technological hurdles to conceptual barriers, are known, which, taken together, explain why research in this area has been relatively slow. However, this last decade, the scientific community has challenged the dogma and became more enthusiastic about the modulation of PPIs with small drug-like molecules. In fact, several success stories were reported both, at the preclinical and clinical stages. In this review article, written for the 2014 International Summer School in Chemoinformatics (Strasbourg, France), we discuss in silico tools (essentially post 2012) and databases that can assist the design of low molecular weight PPI modulators (these tools can be found at www.vls3d.com). We first introduce the field of protein–protein interaction research, discuss key challenges and comment recently reported in silico packages, protocols and databases dedicated to PPIs.

This study utilizes the world's largest traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) database and virtual screening to provide potential compounds for RbAp48 binding. A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was employed to understand the variations after protein-ligand interaction. FOG1 was found to exhibit low stability after RbAp48 binding; the peptide displayed significant movement from the initial docking position, a phenomenon which matched the docking results. The protein structure of the other TCM candidates was not variable during MD simulation and had a greater stable affinity for RbAp48 binding than FOG1. Our results reveal that the protein structure does not affect ligand binding, and the top three TCM candidates Bittersweet alkaloid II, Eicosandioic acid, and Perivine might resolve the instability of the RbAp48-FOG1 complex and thus be used in AD therapy.",

The significance of perceiving function in terms of conformational heterogeneity is gradually shifting the interest in the community from folding to function. From the free energy landscape standpoint the principles are unchanged: rather than considering the entire protein conformational landscape, the focus is on the ensemble around the bottom of the folding funnel. The protein can be viewed as populating one of two states: active or inactive. The basins of the two states are separated by a surmountable barrier, which allows the conformations to switch between the states. Unless the protein is a repressor, under physiological conditions it typically populates the inactive state. Ligand binding (or post-translational modification) triggers a switch to the active state. Constitutive allosteric mutations work by shifting the population from the inactive to the active state and keeping it there. This can happen by either destabilizing the inactive state, stabilizing the active state, or both. Identification of the mechanism through which they work is important since it may assist in drug discovery. Here we spotlight the usefulness of the free energy landscape in translational science, illustrating how oncogenic mutations can work in key proteins from the EGFR/Ras/Raf/Erk/Mek pathway, the main signaling pathway in cancer. Finally, we delineate the key components which are needed in order to trace the mechanism of allosteric events.",

Here we show that developmentally impaired human embryos elicit an endoplasmic stress response in human decidual cells. A stress response was also evident upon in vivo exposure of mouse uteri to culture medium conditioned by low-quality human embryos. By contrast, signals emanating from developmentally competent embryos activated a focused gene network enriched in metabolic enzymes and implantation factors. We further show that trypsin, a serine protease released by pre-implantation embryos, elicits Ca2+ signaling in endometrial epithelial cells. Competent human embryos triggered short-lived oscillatory Ca2+ fluxes whereas low-quality embryos caused a heightened and prolonged Ca2+ response. Thus, distinct positive and negative mechanisms contribute to active selection of human embryos at implantation.",

Crystal structure analysis demonstrated that the inserted foreign peptide is well exposed on the particle surface without significant structural changes in the capsid. Importantly, such insertions do not seem to affect the virus uncoating process as illustrated by the conformational similarity between an uncoating intermediate of another recombinant virus and that of EV71.

Although there is an enormous body of literature on other hippocampal subfields (CA1 and CA3), relatively little is known about the physiological and developmental properties of CA2. Here we report identification of the CA2 region in the mouse by immunostaining with a Purkinje cell protein 4 (PCP4) antibody, which effectively delineates CA3/CA2 and CA2/CA1 borders and agrees well with previous cytoarchitectural definitions of CA2. The PCP4 immunostaining–delineated CA2 neurons have distinguishable differences in cell morphology, physiology, and synaptic circuit connections compared with distal CA3 and proximal CA1 regions. The average somatic sizes of excitatory cells differ across CA1–3, with the smallest to largest somatic size being CA1<CA2<CA3. CA2 excitatory cells have dense dendritic spines, but do not have thorny excrescences associated with bordering CA3 neurons. Photostimulation functional circuit mapping shows that CA2 excitatory neurons receives extensive synaptic input from CA3, but no detectable input from the dentate gyrus. CA2 excitatory cells also differ significantly from CA3 cells in intrinsic electrophysiological parameters, such as membrane capacitance and spiking rates. Although CA2 neurons differ from CA1 neurons for PCP4 and other marker expressions, these neurons have less distinct neurophysiological and morphological properties. Developmental examination revealed that PCP4 immunostaining first appears at postnatal day 4–5 and becomes successively more refined around CA2 until reaching adult form by postnatal day 21. J. Comp.

They are located at the invariant interface between the proximal and distal segments of clathrin heavy chains, in triskelions centered on two adjacent vertices of the coated-vesicle lattice. Mutation of these histidine to glutamine alters the pH dependence of coat stability. We then describe single-particle fluorescence imaging experiments in which we follow the effect of these histidine mutations on susceptibility to Hsc70-dependent uncoating.

Here, we identify an interaction between the T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC-PTP, officially known as PTPN2) and the carboxyl terminus of connexin43 (Cx43, officially known as GJA1). Two cell lines, normal rat kidney (NRK) cells endogenously expressing Cx43 and an NRK-derived cell line expressing v-Src with temperature-sensitive activity, were used to demonstrate that EGF and v-Src stimulation, respectively, induced TC-PTP to colocalize with Cx43 at the plasma membrane. Cell biology experiments using phospho-specific antibodies and biophysical assays demonstrated that the interaction is direct and that TC-PTP dephosphorylates Cx43 residues Y247 and Y265, but does not affect v-Src. Transfection of TC-PTP also indirectly led to the dephosphorylation of Cx43 S368, by inactivating PKCα and PKCδ, with no effect on the phosphorylation of S279 and S282 (MAPK-dependent phosphorylation sites). Dephosphorylation maintained Cx43 gap junctions at the plaque and partially reversed the channel closure caused by v-Src-mediated phosphorylation of Cx43. Understanding dephosphorylation, along with the well-documented roles of Cx43 phosphorylation, might eventually lead to methods to modulate the regulation of gap junction channels, with potential benefits for human health.",Gap junctions;Connexin43;TC-PTP;v-Src;Phosphorylation;Tyrosine phosphatase

Heterodimers composed of GTP-bound α- and β-tubulin molecules polymerize to form microtubule protofilaments, which associate laterally to form a hollow microtubule. Tubulin has GTPase activity and the GTP molecules associated with β-tubulin molecules are hydrolyzed shortly after being incorporated into the polymerizing microtubules. GTP hydrolysis alters the conformation of the tubulin molecules and drives the dynamic behavior of microtubules. Periods of rapid microtubule polymerization alternate with periods of shrinkage in a process known as dynamic instability. In plants, dynamic instability plays a key role in determining the organization of microtubules into arrays, and these arrays vary throughout the cell cycle. In this review, we describe the mechanisms that regulate microtubule dynamics and underlie dynamic instability, and discuss how dynamic instability may shape microtubule organization in plant cells.",cortical array;dynamic instability;GTP hydrolysis;microtubule;phragmoplast;tubulin

Isothermal chemical denaturation (ICD) has been shown to be a valuable biophysical method to determine in a direct and label-free fashion the binding of ligands to soluble proteins. In this communication, the application of isothermal chemical denaturation is applied to an integral membrane protein, the A2a G-protein coupled receptor. Binding affinities for a set of nineteen small molecule agonists/antagonists of the A2aR were determined and found to be in agreement with data from surface plasmon resonance and radioligand binding assays previously reported in the literature. Therefore isothermal chemical denaturation expands the available toolkit of biophysical techniques to characterize and study ligand binding to integral membrane proteins, specifically GPCRs in vitro.",

An additional complication that hinders further development of effective AR strategies is that the mechanisms by which the directed therapies are bypassed may vary. Finally, the question must be addressed as to whether the androgen receptor remains to be the driver of most castration resistant disease or whether truly AR-independent tumors arise after successful androgen ablation therapy.

In a direct comparison with known Myc inhibitors using human and avian cell systems, the pyridine compounds reveal a unique inhibitory potential even at sub-micromolar concentrations combined with remarkable specificity for the inhibition of Myc-driven tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore, we show in direct comparisons using defined avian cell systems that different Max PPI profiles for the variant members of the Myc protein family (c-Myc, v-Myc, N-Myc, L-Myc) correlate with their diverse oncogenic potential and their variable sensitivity to the novel pyridine inhibitors.",transcription factor;protein-protein interactions;biosensor;small-molecule inhibitors;cancer

Here we investigate the driving force for the binding of R12 (a ribonucleic acid aptamer) and P16 (a partial peptide of a prion protein) during which P16 exhibits the global structural change. We calculate changes in thermodynamic quantities upon the R12–P16 binding using a statistical-mechanical approach combined with molecular models for water which is currently best suited to studies on hydration of biomolecules. The binding is driven by a water-entropy gain originating primarily from an increase in the total volume available to the translational displacement of water molecules in the system. The energy decrease due to the gain of R12–P16 attractive (van der Waals and electrostatic) interactions is almost canceled out by the energy increase related to the loss of R12–water and P16–water attractive interactions. We can explain the general experimental result that stacking of flat moieties, hydrogen bonding and molecular-shape and electrostatic complementarities are frequently observed in the complexes. It is argued that the water-entropy gain is largely influenced by the geometric characteristics (overall shapes, sizes and detailed polyatomic structures) of the biomolecules.",

We find the interdomain α-helices to be stabilized by the hydrophobic interface formed between the N-terminal half of these helices and adjacent Ig domains, and, interestingly, to show a rapid unfolding and refolding equilibrium especially under low axial forces up to ∼15 pN. These results support and yield atomic details for the notion of recent atomic-force microscopy experiments, namely, that the unique helices inserted between Ig domains in myomesin function as elastomers and force buffers. Our results also explain how the C-terminal dimer of two myomesin molecules is mechanically outperforming the helices and Ig domains in myomesin and elsewhere, explaining former experimental findings. This study provides a fresh view onto how myomesin integrates elastic helices, rigid immunoglobulin domains, and an extraordinarily resistant dimer into a molecular structure, to feature a mechanical hierarchy that represents a firm and yet extensible molecular anchor to guard the stability of the sarcomere.",

There are multiple modes of inheritance and degrees of severity (ranging from foetal akinesia, through lethality in the newborn period to milder early and later onset cases). Classically, the congenital myopathies are defined by skeletal muscle dysfunction and a non-dystrophic muscle biopsy with the presence of one or more characteristic histological features. However, mutations in multiple different genes can cause the same pathology and mutations in the same gene can cause multiple different pathologies. This is becoming ever more apparent now that, with the increasing use of next generation sequencing, a genetic diagnosis is achieved for a greater number of patients. Thus, considerable genetic and pathological overlap is emerging, blurring the classically established boundaries. At the same time, some of the pathophysiological concepts underlying the congenital myopathies are moving into sharper focus. Here we explore whether our emerging understanding of disease pathogenesis and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, rather than a strictly gene-centric approach, will provide grounds for a different and perhaps complementary grouping of the congenital myopathies, that at the same time could help instil the development of shared potential therapeutic approaches. Stemming from recent advances in the congenital myopathy field, five key pathophysiology themes have emerged: defects in (i) sarcolemmal and intracellular membrane remodelling and excitation-contraction coupling; (ii) mitochondrial distribution and function; (iii) myofibrillar force generation; (iv) atrophy; and (v) autophagy. Based on numerous emerging lines of evidence from recent studies in cell lines and patient tissues, mouse models and zebrafish highlighting these unifying pathophysiological themes, here we review the congenital myopathies in relation to these emerging pathophysiological concepts, highlighting both areas of overlap between established entities, as well as areas of distinction within single gene disorders.",congenital myopathy;pathophysiology;mitochondria;membrane remodelling;force generation;atrophy;autophagy;triad;excitation-contraction coupling

These model solvent systems mimic the cellular environment by providing denaturing conditions and a hydrophobic environment with limited water content. Thioflavin T (ThT) assay revealed that binary mixtures of water with formamide and its methyl derivatives enhanced fibrillation rates and β-sheet abundance, whereas organic solvents suppressed insulin fibrillation. We utilized solution small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to investigate the correlation between protein-solvent interactions and insulin fibrillation. SAXS experiments combined with simulated annealing of the protein indicated that the degree of denaturation of the hydrophobic core region at residues B11–B17 determines the fibrillation rate.

The 3D structure of cysteine protease YopT of Yersinia pestis was determined by means of homology modeling through multiple alignments followed by intensive optimization and validation. The modeling was done by Phyre 2 and refined by ModRefiner. The obtained model was verified with structure validation programs such as PROCHECK, verify 3D and ERRAT for reliability. Interacting partners and active sites were also determined. PROCHECK analysis showed that 93% of the residues are in the most favored region, 5.9% are in the additional allowed region and 1.1% are in the generously allowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The verify 3D value of 0.78 indicates that the environmental profile of the model is good. SOPMA is employed for calculation of the secondary structural features of cysteine protease YopT.

Although direct inhibition of tau aggregation has shown promise as a potential treatment strategy for depressing neurofibrillary lesion formation in Alzheimer’s disease, the mechanism of action of these compounds has been unclear. However, recent studies have found that tau aggregation antagonists exert their effects through both covalent and non-covalent means, and have identified associated potency and selectivity driving features. Here we review small-molecule tau aggregation inhibitors with a focus on compound structure and inhibitory mechanism. The elucidation of inhibitory mechanism has implications for maximizing on-target efficacy while minimizing off-target side effects.",Alzheimer’s disease;tau;neurofibrillary tangle;paired helical filaments;aggregation

It is largely unknown how the enzyme is controlled in a nuclear context. Several studies have suggested that its C-terminal domain (CTD), which is dispensable for basal relaxation activity, has some regulatory influence. In this work, we examined the impact of nuclear localization on regulation of activity in nuclei. Specifically, human cells were transfected with wild-type and mutant topo IIβ tagged with EGFP. Activity attenuation experiments and nuclear localization data reveal that the endogenous activity of topo IIβ is correlated with its subnuclear distribution. The enzyme shuttles between an active form in the nucleoplasm and a quiescent form in the nucleolus in a dynamic equilibrium. Mechanistically, the process involves a tethering event with RNA. Isolated RNA inhibits the catalytic activity of topo IIβ in vitro through the interaction with a specific 50-residue region of the CTD (termed the CRD). Taken together, these results suggest that both the subnuclear distribution and activity regulation of topo IIβ are mediated by the interplay between cellular RNA and the CRD.",

Moreover, the combination of Cryo-TEM and other methods such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics modeling are allowing researchers to address scientific questions previously thought intractable.

Following DNA replication, nucleosomes are then reassembled onto replicated DNA using both parental and newly synthesized histones. This process, termed DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly (RCNA), is critical for maintaining genome integrity and for the propagation of epigenetic information, dysfunctions of which have been implicated in cancers and aging. In recent years, it has been shown that RCNA is carefully orchestrated by a series of histone modifications, histone chaperones and histone-modifying enzymes. Interestingly, many features of RCNA are also found in processes involving DNA replication-independent nucleosome assembly like histone exchange and gene transcription. In yeast, histone H3 lysine K56 acetylation (H3K56ac) is found in newly synthesized histone H3 and is critical for proper nucleosome assembly and for maintaining genomic stability. The histone acetyltransferase (HAT) regulator of Ty1 transposition 109 (Rtt109) is the sole enzyme responsible for H3K56ac in yeast. Much research has centered on this particular histone modification and histone-modifying enzyme. This Critical Review summarizes much of our current understanding of nucleosome assembly and highlights many important insights learned from studying Rtt109 HATs in fungi. We highlight some seminal features in nucleosome assembly conserved in mammalian systems and describe some of the lingering questions in the field. Further studying fungal and mammalian chromatin assembly may have important public health implications, including deeper understandings of human cancers and aging as well as the pursuit of novel anti-fungal therapies.",Chromatin;epigenetics;H3K56ac;histone acetyltransferases;nucleosome assembly;replication-coupled nucleosome assembly;Rtt109

We have previously demonstrated that its stability is strongly dependent on ionic strength and that monovalent or divalent cations are able to considerably stabilize the fold. Here, we present a study of the folded state and of the structural determinants that lead to the strong salt dependence. We demonstrate by nuclear magnetic resonance that, at room temperature, Yfh1 exists as an equilibrium mixture of a folded species and a folding intermediate in slow exchange equilibrium. The equilibrium completely shifts in favor of the folded species by the addition of even small concentrations of salt. We demonstrate that Yfh1 is destabilized by a localized energetic frustration arising from an “electrostatic hinge” made of negatively charged residues mapped in the β-sheet. Salt interactions at this site have a “frustration-relieving” effect. We discuss the consequences of our findings for the function of Yfh1 and for our understanding of protein folding stability.",cold denaturation;frataxin;metallo proteins;NMR;thermodynamic stability

Here, we identified the CXC domain of MSL2 specifically recognizing the MRE motif and determined its crystal structure bound to specific and nonspecific DNAs. The CXC domain primarily contacts one strand of DNA duplex and employs a single arginine to directly read out dinucleotide sequences from the minor groove. The arginine is flexible when bound to nonspecific sequences. The core region of the MRE motif harbors two binding sites on opposite strands that can cooperatively recruit a CXC dimer. Specific DNA-binding mutants of MSL2 are impaired in MRE binding and X chromosome localization in vivo.

They consist of a helicase domain and a topoisomerase domain that closely cooperate in catalysis. The mechanism of the functional cooperation of these domains has remained elusive. Recent studies have shown that the helicase domain is a nucleotide-regulated conformational switch that alternates between an open conformation with a low affinity for double-stranded DNA, and a closed state with a high double-stranded DNA affinity. The conformational cycle leads to transient separation of DNA duplexes by the helicase domain. Reverse gyrase-specific insertions in the helicase module are involved in binding to single-stranded DNA regions, DNA unwinding and supercoiling. Biochemical and structural data suggest that DNA processing by reverse gyrase is not based on sequential action of the helicase and topoisomerase domains, but rather the result of an intricate cooperation of both domains at all stages of the reaction. This review summarizes the recent advances of our understanding of the reverse gyrase mechanism. We put forward and discuss a refined, yet simple model in which reverse gyrase directs strand passage toward increasing linking numbers and positive supercoiling by controlling the conformation of a bound DNA bubble.",

The only synthetic weak field example is [Fe4S4{N(SiMe3)2}4] (13), obtained in moderate yield in self-assembly systems by the reaction of [Fe{N(SiMe3)2}2] with one equiv of sulfur in toluene,37 or by the balanced reaction of [FeCl{N(SiMe3)2}2(THF)] with NaSH in THF.38 These procedures are incorporated in scheme [3]. Addition of Na2S to 13 leads to reduced clusters and the isolation of the three-membered redox series [Fe4S4{N(SiMe3)2}4]0,1−,2−. From a chemical perspective, isolation of the full suite of five [Fe4S4]n oxidation states, four of which have been stabilized by cysteinate ligation in proteins, is a matter of considerable satisfaction while simultaneously emphasizing the importance of terminal ligation on oxidation state stability (Figure 2). Cysteinate and its surrogate thiolate ligands (whose σ/π basicity and steric features are controllable by substitution) stabilize the three intermediate states (n = 1+, 2+, 3+). These ligands also bind to the n = 0 state as does the carbene, a potent neutral σ-donor that ameliorates oxidative instability by minimizing overall negative charge, resulting in a cluster of sufficient stability for isolation and study. As a strong σ/π donor anion, (Me3Si)2N− stabilizes FeIII and, unlike thiolate, is not readily oxidized. Additionally, the ligand provides steric shielding of the oxidized core against attack by solvent or other nucleophiles.",

Phosphatase activity must subsequently be restored to promote mitotic exit. Although Cdc14 phosphatase drives this reversal in budding yeast, Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) and Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activities have each been independently linked to mitotic exit control in other eukaryotes1-6. We now describe a mitotic phosphatase relay in which PP1 reactivation is required for the reactivation of both PP2A-B55 and PP2A-B56 to coordinate mitotic progression and exit in fission yeast. The staged recruitment of PP1 to the regulatory subunits of PP2A-B55 and PP2A-B56 holoenzymes sequentially activates each phosphatase. The pathway is blocked in early mitosis because Cdk1-Cyclin B inhibits PP1 activity but declining Cyclin B levels later in mitosis permit PP1 to auto-reactivate1,7-10. PP1 first reactivates PP2A-B55; this enables PP2A-B55, in turn, to promote the reactivation of PP2A-B56 by dephosphorylating a PP1 docking site in PP2A-B56, thereby promoting the recruitment of PP1. PP1 recruitment to human, mitotic, PP2A holoenzymes and the sequences of these conserved PP1 docking motifs11,12 suggest that PP1 regulates PP2A-B55 and PP2A-B56 activities in a variety of signalling contexts throughout eukaryotes.",

Substrates first partition into the bilayer and then interact with a large flexible binding pocket within the transporter’s transmembrane regions. Pgp has been described as a hydrophobic vacuum cleaner or an outwardly directed drug/lipid flippase. Recent X-ray crystal structures have shed some light on the nature of the drug-binding pocket and suggested routes by which substrates can enter it from the membrane. Detergents have profound effects on Pgp function, and several appear to be substrates. Biochemical and biophysical studies in vitro, some using purified reconstituted protein, have explored the effects of the membrane environment. They have demonstrated that Pgp is involved in a complex relationship with its lipid environment, which modulates the behavior of its substrates, as well as various functions of the protein, including ATP hydrolysis, drug binding, and drug transport. Membrane lipid composition and fluidity, phospholipid headgroup and acyl chain length all influence Pgp function. Recent studies focusing on thermodynamics and kinetics have revealed some important principles governing Pgp–lipid and substrate–lipid interactions, and how these affect drug-binding and transport. In some cells, Pgp is associated with cholesterol-rich microdomains, which may modulate its functions. The relationship between Pgp and cholesterol remains an open question; however, it clearly affects several aspects of its function in addition to substrate–membrane partitioning. The action of Pgp modulators appears to depend on their membrane permeability, and membrane fluidizers and surfactants reverse drug resistance, likely via an indirect mechanism. A detailed understanding of how the membrane affects Pgp substrates and Pgp’s catalytic cycle may lead to new strategies to combat clinical drug resistance.",P-glycoprotein (ABCB1);phospholipids;detergents;cholesterol;ATP hydrolysis;membrane partitioning;membrane transport;drug binding

In the absence of crystal structures, understanding the molecular mechanism of interaction between ExoR and the ExoS sensor, which is believed to drive the key regulatory step in the invasion process, remains a major challenge. In this study, we present a theoretical structural model of the active form of ExoR protein, ExoRm, generated using computational methods. Our model suggests that ExoR possesses a super-helical fold comprising 12 α-helices forming six Sel1-like repeats, including two that were unidentified in previous studies. This fold is highly conducive to mediating protein–protein interactions and this is corroborated by the identification of putative protein binding sites on the surface of the ExoRm protein. Our studies reveal two novel insights: (a) an extended conformation of the third Sel1-like repeat that might be important for ExoR regulatory function and (b) a buried proteolytic site that implies a unique proteolytic mechanism. This study provides new and interesting insights into the structure of S. meliloti ExoR, lays the groundwork for elaborating the molecular mechanism of ExoRm cleavage, ExoRm–ExoS interactions, and studies of ExoR homologs in other bacterial host interactions.",ExoR;Sinorhizobium meliloti Rm1021;sel1-like repeats;superhelical fold;molecular modeling;computational analyses;ExoS

Identification of epitopes for a given antigen chain finds vital applications in vaccine and drug research. Experimental prediction of B-cell epitopes is time-consuming and resource intensive, which may benefit from the computational approaches to identify B-cell epitopes. In this paper, a novel cost-sensitive ensemble algorithm is proposed for predicting the antigenic determinant residues and then a spatial clustering algorithm is adopted to identify the potential epitopes. Firstly, we explore various discriminative features from primary sequences. Secondly, cost-sensitive ensemble scheme is introduced to deal with imbalanced learning problem. Thirdly, we adopt spatial algorithm to tell which residues may potentially form the epitopes. Based on the strategies mentioned above, a new predictor, called CBEP (conformational B-cell epitopes prediction), is proposed in this study. CBEP achieves good prediction performance with the mean AUC scores (AUCs) of 0.721 and 0.703 on two benchmark datasets (bound and unbound) using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). When compared with previous prediction tools, CBEP produces higher sensitivity and comparable specificity values.

Here, we report direct observation of reversible clusters in concentrated solutions of mAbs using neutron spin echo. Specifically, a stable mAb solution is studied across a transition from dispersed monomers in dilute solution to clustered states at more concentrated conditions, where clusters of a preferred size are observed. Once mAb clusters have formed, their size, in contrast to that observed in typical globular protein solutions, is observed to remain nearly constant over a wide range of concentrations. Our results not only conclusively establish a clear relationship between the undesirable high viscosity of some mAb solutions and the formation of reversible clusters with extended open structures, but also directly observe self-assembled mAb protein clusters of preferred small finite size similar to that in micelle formation that dominate the properties of concentrated mAb solutions.",

The IFTA algorithm proceeds by first detecting the pole with largest number of microtubule minus-ends that lie within the threshold distance, Rs. The centre-of-mass of these ends is used as the first point defining the spindle. A sphere with a radius, Rs, is then centred at the pole, and used to detect the positions where microtubules intersect the ball's surface. A constrained optimisation calculation is then used to determine the point lying on the sphere's surface that minimises the mean-squared distance from the microtubule crossings. This point is selected as the second position in the three-dimensional interpolation of the spindle axis whilst microtubule coordinates that lie within the sphere are masked.

","The maintenance of the proteome is essential to preserve cell functionality and the ability to respond and adapt to the changing environment. This is regulated by the proteostasis network, a dedicated set of molecular components comprised of molecular chaperones and protein clearance mechanisms, regulated by cell stress signaling pathways, that prevents the toxicity associated with protein misfolding and accumulation of toxic aggregates in different subcellular compartments and tissues. The efficiency of the proteostasis network declines with age and this failure in protein homeostasis has been proposed to underlie the basis of common age-related human disorders. The current advances in the understanding of the mechanisms and regulation of proteostasis and of the different types of digressions in this process in aging have turned the attention toward the therapeutic opportunities offered by the restoration of proteostasis in age-associated degenerative diseases. Here, we discuss some of the unresolved questions on proteostasis that need to be addressed to enhance healthspan and to diminish the pathology associated with persistent protein damage.",Autophagy;Chaperones;ER stress;Human degenerative diseases;Proteasome.

NS5A is a phosphoprotein, and it has been proposed that differential phosphorylation could regulate the various roles of the protein. By SDS-PAGE, two forms of NS5A with distinct apparent molecular weights can be observed, referred to as basally phosphorylated and hyperphosphorylated species. However, the sites of phosphorylation on these two species have not been unequivocally identified, hampering our understanding of the function and regulation of NS5A. To address this, we purified tagged NS5A from cells harboring a replicating subgenomic replicon and analyzed the purified protein by mass spectrometry. We identified six peptide fragments containing 12 phosphorylated residues and were able to assign four of these to serines 146, 222, and 225 and threonine 348. A serine-rich peptide fragment spanning residues 221 to 240 was highly phosphorylated. Using mutagenesis, we identified roles for a subset of these phosphoacceptors in virus genome replication. We further showed that phosphorylation at S146 regulates hyperphosphorylation, and by generating a phospho-specific antibody targeted to pS222, we identified that S222 phosphorylation predominates in the hyperphosphorylated species. Last, by introducing phosphomimetic mutations across residues 221 to 240, we demonstrated changes in the mobility of the basally phosphorylated species suggestive of a sequential phosphorylation cascade within this serine-rich cluster. We propose that this regulation could drive a conformational switch between the dimeric structures of NS5A and could also explain the different functions of the protein in the virus life cycle.",

The objective of this study was to determine if PSEN1 plays a direct role in the development of α-synuclein pathology in these diseases. Using mass spectrometry, immunoelectron microscopy and fluorescence lifetime image microscopy based on Forster resonance energy transfer (FLIM-FRET) we identified α-synuclein as a novel interactor of PSEN1 in wild-type mouse brain tissue. The interaction of α-synuclein with PSEN1 was detected in post-mortem brain tissue from cognitively normal cases and was significantly increased in tissue from cases with dementia with Lewy bodies and familial Alzheimer’s disease associated with known PSEN1 mutations. We confirmed an increased interaction of PSEN1 and α-synuclein in cell lines expressing well characterized familial Alzheimer’s disease PSEN1 mutations, L166P and delta exon 9, and demonstrated that PSEN1 mutations associate with increased membrane association and accumulation of α-synuclein. Our data provides evidence of a molecular interaction of PSEN1 and α-synuclein that may explain the clinical and pathophysiological overlap seen in synucleinopathies, including Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and some forms of Alzheimer’s disease.",presenilin;α-synuclein;Lewy body;Alzheimer’s disease;Parkinson’s disease;dementia;ageing

However, its experimental characterisation is a daunting task. Thus, simple models have been proposed and investigated. They have revealed that genotypes differ in their robustness to mutations; phenotypes are represented by a broadly varying number of genotypes, and simple point mutations suffice to navigate the space of genotypes while maintaining a phenotype. Nonetheless, most current models focus only on one level of the map (folded molecules, gene regulatory networks, or networks of metabolic reactions), so that many relevant questions cannot be addressed. Here we introduce toyLIFE, a multi-level model for the genotype-phenotype map based on simple genomes and interaction rules from which a complex behaviour at upper levels emerges —remarkably plastic gene regulatory networks and metabolism. toyLIFE is a tool that permits the investigation of how different levels are coupled, in particular how and where mutations affect phenotype or how the presence of certain metabolites determines the dynamics of toyLIFE gene regulatory networks. The model can easily incorporate evolution through more complex mutations, recombination, or gene duplication and deletion, thus opening an avenue to explore extended genotype-phenotype maps.",

We construct a model of PhoQ signal transduction using Bayesian inference, based on disulfide crosslinking data and homologous crystal structures. The data are incompatible with a single conformation but are instead consistent with two interconverting structures. These states differ in membrane depth of the periplasmic acidic patch and the reciprocal displacement of diagonal helices along the dimer interface. Studies of multiple histidine kinases suggest this repacking might be a common mode of signal transduction in sensor His-kinase receptors.

MscS homologs exhibit diverse topology and domain structure, and it has been proposed that the more complex members of the family might have novel regulatory mechanisms or molecular functions. Here, we present a study of MscS-Like (MSL)10 from Arabidopsis thaliana that supports these ideas. High-level expression of MSL10-GFP in Arabidopsis induced small stature, hydrogen peroxide accumulation, ectopic cell death, and reactive oxygen species- and cell death-associated gene expression. Phosphomimetic mutations in the MSL10 N-terminal domain prevented these phenotypes. The phosphorylation state of MSL10 also regulated its ability to induce cell death when transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves but did not affect subcellular localization, assembly, or channel behavior. Finally, the N-terminal domain of MSL10 was sufficient to induce cell death in tobacco, independent of phosphorylation state. We conclude that the plant-specific N-terminal domain of MSL10 is capable of inducing cell death, this activity is regulated by phosphorylation, and MSL10 has two separable activities—one as an ion channel and one as an inducer of cell death.

Induction of the wild-type protein but not the mutant interfered with cell proliferation, predominantly through induction of apoptosis.

IFN-γ-producing T helper (Th)1 CD4+ T cells mediate the immune destruction of hematopoietic cells, and are central to the pathogenesis. However, the molecular events that control the development of BM-destructive Th1 cells remain largely unknown. Ezh2 is a chromatin-modifying enzyme that regulates multiple cellular processes primarily by silencing gene expression. We recently reported that Ezh2 is crucial for inflammatory T cell responses after allogeneic BM transplantation. To elucidate whether Ezh2 mediates pathogenic Th1 responses in AA and the mechanism of Ezh2 action in regulating Th1 cells, we studied the effects of Ezh2 inhibition in CD4+ T cells using a mouse model of human AA. Conditionally deleting Ezh2 in mature T cells dramatically reduced the production of BM-destructive Th1 cells in vivo, decreased BM-infiltrating Th1 cells, and rescued mice from BM failure. Ezh2 inhibition resulted in significant decrease in the expression of Tbx21 and Stat4 (which encode transcription factors T-bet and STAT4, respectively). Introduction of T-bet but not STAT4 into Ezh2-deficient T cells fully rescued their differentiation into Th1 cells mediating AA. Ezh2 bound to the Tbx21 promoter in Th1 cells, and directly activated Tbx21 transcription. Unexpectedly, Ezh2 was also required to prevent proteasome-mediated degradation of T-bet protein in Th1 cells. Our results identify T-bet as the transcriptional and post-translational Ezh2 target that acts together to generate BM-destructive Th1 cells, and highlight the therapeutic potential of Ezh2 inhibition in reducing AA and other autoimmune diseases.",

Previously we have established that a CTD-derived 34-residue peptide associates into a tetramer in a pH-dependent manner (Kamnesky et al., JMB 2012;418:237-247). Here we further investigate the molecular determinants of tetramer formation in the CTD by characterizing the kinetics of monomer-tetramer equilibrium for 10 alanine mutants using NMR, sedimentation equilibrium (SE) and molecular dynamics simulation. NMR and SE concur in finding single-residue contributions to tetramer stability to be in the 0.5 to 3.5 kcal/mol range. Hydrophobic interactions between residues lining the tetramer core generally contributed more to formation of tetramer than electrostatic interactions between residues R147, D149 and E152. In particular, alanine replacement of residue R147, a key contributor to inter-subunit salt bridges, resulted in only a minor effect on tetramer dissociation. Mutations outside of the inter-subunit interface also influenced tetramer stability by affecting the tetramerization on-rate, possibly by changing the inherent helical propensity of the peptide. These findings are interpreted in the context of established paradigms of protein-protein interactions and protein folding, and lay the groundwork for further studies of the CTD in full-length KcsA channels.",structural biology;protein–protein interactions;potassium channels;NMR;sedimentation equilibrium

The exact nature of how these compounds have an inhibitory effect on HCV is unknown; however, major resistance mutations appear in the N-terminal region of NS5A that include the amphipathic helix and domain 1. The dimeric symmetry of these compounds suggests that they act on a dimer of NS5A, which is also consistent with the presence of dimers in crystals of NS5A domain 1 from genotype 1b. Genotype 1a HCV is less potently affected by these compounds and resistance mutations have a greater effect than in the 1b genotypes. We have obtained crystals of domain 1 of the important 1a NS5A homologue and intriguingly, our X-ray crystal structure reveals two new dimeric forms of this domain. Furthermore, the high solvent content (75%) makes it ideal for ligand-soaking. Daclatasvir (DCV) shows twofold symmetry suggesting NS5A dimers may be of physiological importance and serve as potential binding sites for DCV. These dimers also allow for new conformations of a NS5A expansive network which could explain its operation on the membranous web.

Under diseased conditions, a heart may lose its normal rhythm and degenerate suddenly into much faster and irregular rhythms, called arrhythmias, which may lead to sudden death. The transition from a normal rhythm to an arrhythmia is a transition from regular electrical wave conduction to irregular or turbulent wave conduction in the heart, and thus this medical problem is also a problem of physics and mathematics. In the last century, clinical, experimental, and theoretical studies have shown that dynamical theories play fundamental roles in understanding the mechanisms of the genesis of the normal heart rhythm as well as lethal arrhythmias. In this article, we summarize in detail the nonlinear and stochastic dynamics occurring in the heart and their links to normal cardiac functions and arrhythmias, providing a holistic view through integrating dynamics from the molecular (microscopic) scale, to the organelle (mesoscopic) scale, to the cellular, tissue, and organ (macroscopic) scales. We discuss what existing problems and challenges are waiting to be solved and how multi-scale mathematical modeling and nonlinear dynamics may be helpful for solving these problems.",excitable medium;heart rhythm;arrhythmias;electrical turbulence;dynamics;control

Hura,,"The recent innovation of collecting X-ray scattering from solutions containing purified macromolecules in high-throughput has yet to be truly exploited by the biological community. Yet, this capability is becoming critical given that the growth of sequence and genomics data is significantly outpacing structural biology results. Given the huge mismatch in information growth rates between sequence and structural methods, their combined high-throughput and high success rate make high-throughput small angle X-ray scattering (HT-SAXS) analyses increasingly valuable. HT-SAXS connects sequence as well as NMR and crystallographic results to biological outcomes by defining the flexible and dynamic complexes controlling cell biology. Commonly falling under the umbrella of bio-SAXS, HT-SAXS data collection pipelines have or are being developed at most synchrotrons. How investigators practically get their biomolecules of interest into these pipelines, balance sample requirements and manage HT-SAXS data output format varies from facility to facility. While these features are unlikely to be standardized across synchrotron beamlines, a detailed description of HT-SAXS issues for one pipeline provides investigators with a practical guide to the general procedures they will encounter. One of the longest running and generally accessible HT-SAXS endstations is the SIBYLS beamline at the Advanced Light Source in Berkeley CA. Here we describe the current state of the SIBYLS HT-SAXS pipeline, what is necessary for investigators to integrate into it, the output format and a summary of results from 2 years of operation.

In this study we utilize virtual screening of the world's largest traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) database and investigate potential compounds for the inhibition of ApoE4. We present the top three TCM candidates: Solapalmitine, Isodesacetyluvaricin, and Budmunchiamine L5 for further investigation. Dynamics analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation were used to simulate protein-ligand complexes for observing the interactions and protein variations. Budmunchiamine L5 did not have the highest score from virtual screening; however, the dynamics pose is similar to the initial docking pose after MD simulation. Trajectory analysis reveals that Budmunchiamine L5 was stable over all simulation times. The migration distance of Budmunchiamine L5 illustrates that docked ligands are not variable from the initial docked site. Interestingly, Arg158 was observed to form H-bonds with Budmunchiamine L5 in the docking pose and MD snapshot, which indicates that the TCM compounds could stably bind to ApoE4. Our results show that Budmunchiamine L5 has good absorption, blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration, and less toxicity according to absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) prediction and could, therefore, be safely used for developing novel ApoE4 inhibitors.",

The sensing thus requires minimal sample purification, and yet achieves high signal-to-background contrast. Moreover, magnetic sensors are also well-suited for miniaturization to match the size of biological targets, which enables sensitive detection of rare cells and small amounts of molecular markers.

The density of export receptors that must bind an mRNA to ensure export, as well as how receptor distribution affects transport dynamics, is not known. It is also unclear whether the rate-limiting step for transport occurs at the nuclear basket, in the central channel, or on the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex. Using previously published biophysical and biochemical parameters of mRNA export, we implemented a three-dimensional, coarse-grained, agent-based model of mRNA export in the nanosecond regime to gain insight into these issues. On running the model, we observed that mRNA export is sensitive to the number and distribution of transport receptors coating the mRNA and that there is a rate-limiting step in the nuclear basket that is potentially associated with the mRNA reconfiguring itself to thread into the central channel. Of note, our results also suggest that using a single location-monitoring mRNA label may be insufficient to correctly capture the time regime of mRNA threading through the pore and subsequent transport. This has implications for future experimental design to study mRNA transport dynamics.",

The microtubule defect of tortifolia2 leads to overbranching and right-handed helical growth in the single-celled leaf trichomes. Here, we use tortifolia2 to further our understanding of microtubules in plant cell differentiation. Trichomes at the branching stage show an apical ring of cortical microtubules, and our analyses support that this ring is involved in marking the prospective branch site. tortifolia2 showed ectopic microtubule bundles at this stage, consistent with a function for microtubules in selecting new branch sites. Overbranching of tortifolia2 required the C-terminal binding protein/brefeldin A-ADP ribosylated substrate protein ANGUSTIFOLIA1, and our results indicate that the angustifolia1 mutant is hypersensitive to alterations in microtubule dynamics. To analyze whether actin and microtubules cooperate in the trichome cell expansion process, we generated double mutants of tortifolia2 with distorted1, a mutant that is defective in the actin-related ARP2/3 complex. The double mutant trichomes showed a complete loss of growth anisotropy, suggesting a genetic interaction of actin and microtubules. Green fluorescent protein labeling of F-actin or microtubules in tortifolia2 distorted1 double mutants indicated that F-actin enhances microtubule dynamics and enables reorientation. Together, our results suggest actin-dependent and -independent functions of cortical microtubules in trichome differentiation.",

Here we show that during erythroid terminal differentiation, Rb plays a previously unappreciated and unorthodox role in promoting DNA replication and cell cycle progression. Specifically, inactivation of Rb in erythroid cells led to stressed DNA replication, increased DNA damage, and impaired cell cycle progression, culminating in defective terminal differentiation and anemia. Importantly, all of these defects associated with Rb loss were exacerbated by the concomitant inactivation of E2f8. Gene expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed that Rb and E2F8 cosuppressed a large array of E2F target genes that are critical for DNA replication and cell cycle progression. Remarkably, inactivation of E2f2 rescued the erythropoietic defects resulting from Rb and E2f8 deficiencies. Interestingly, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) on E2F2 ChIPs indicated that inactivation of Rb and E2f8 synergizes to increase E2F2 binding to its target gene promoters. Taken together, we propose that Rb and E2F8 collaborate to promote DNA replication and erythroid terminal differentiation by preventing E2F2-mediated aberrant transcriptional activation through the ability of Rb to bind and sequester E2F2 and the ability of E2F8 to compete with E2F2 for E2f-binding sites on target gene promoters.",

activation by WCC is essential for rhythmic frq expression.
Because the levels of frq mRNA are extremely low

only transcriptional regulator of frq transcription.
Recently, however, transcriptional repressor RCO-1 was shown to be
an essential clock component that represses WC-independent frq transcription.35 RCO-1 is
a homologue of yeast Tup1p. RCO-1 interacts with Csp1 to regulate
the expression of clock-controlled genes implicated in metabolism.74,75 In the rco-1-null strain, frq mRNA

rhythms are abolished. More interestingly, in the wc rco-1 double mutants, near wild-type amounts of frq mRNA

of frq is essential for rhythmicity. Such an elevation
of the level of frq transcription is also observed
in the wc-1 chd1 double mutant, suggesting that CHD1
mediates the repression of WC-independent frq transcription
by regulating chromatin structure. The conserved RCO-1 complex is
also known to participate in clock regulation in plants. In plants,
the TOPLESS/TOPLESS RELATED (TPL/TPR) complex cooperates with pseudoresponse
regulators, the major players of the plant circadian feedback loops,
to repress the transcription of clock genes.76",

These pathways produce molecules that have a complex framework and exhibit a diverse array of activity due to the variability of the amino acids that are found in them. As these molecules are difficult to synthesize chemically, exploitation of their properties has been modest. The patellamide pathway involves amino acid heterocyclization, peptide cleavage, peptide macrocyclization, heterocycle oxidation and epimerization; closely related products are also prenylated. Enzyme activities have been identified for all these transformations except epimerization, which may be spontaneous. This review highlights the recent structural and mechanistic work on amino acid heterocyclization, peptide cleavage and peptide macrocyclization. This work should help in using the enzymes to produce novel analogs of the natural products enabling an exploitation of their properties.",

Here we use ChlP-exo to resolve the organization of individual histones on a genomic scale. We detect widespread subnucleosomal structures in dynamic chromatin, including what appear to be half nucleosomes consisting of one copy of each histone. We also detect interactions of H3 tails with linker DNA between nucleosomes, which may be negatively regulated by methylation of H3K36. Histone variant H2A.Z is enriched on the promoter-distal half of the +1 nucleosome, whereas H2BK123 ubiquitylation and H3K9 acetylation are enriched on the promoter-proximal half in a transcription-linked manner.

At the end of the last century, the leading paradigm, which is currently well rooted, considered the origin of neoplasms to be a set of genetic and/or epigenetic mutations, stochastic and independent in a single cell, or rather, a stochastic monoclonal pattern. However, in the last 20 years, two important areas of research have underlined numerous limitations and incongruities of this pattern, the hypothesis of the so-called cancer stem cell theory and a revaluation of several alterations in metabolic networks that are typical of the neoplastic cell, the so-called Warburg effect. Even if this specific “metabolic sign” has been known for more than 85 years, only in the last few years has it been given more attention; therefore, the so-called Warburg hypothesis has been used in multiple and independent surveys. Based on an accurate analysis of a series of considerations and of biophysical thermodynamic events in the literature, we will demonstrate a homogeneous pattern of the cancer stem cell theory, of the Warburg hypothesis and of the stochastic monoclonal pattern; this pattern could contribute considerably as the first basis of the development of a new uniform theory on the origin of neoplasms. Thus, a new possible epistemological paradigm is represented; this paradigm considers the Warburg effect as a specific “metabolic sign” reflecting the stem origin of the neoplastic cell, where, in this specific metabolic order, an essential reason for the genetic instability that is intrinsic to the neoplastic cell is defined.",cancer;glycolysis;cancer stem cells;Warburg effect;ATP;mitochondria;epigenetic modulation;oxidative phosphorylation;differentiation;aerobic glycolysis;entropy;free energy;dissipative structure;epithelial-mesenchymal transition;cancerogenesis;human embryonic stem cells;induced pluripotent stem cells;self renewal

This source of variation is becoming more and more apparent thanks to the recent advances in dynamic imaging and single-cell analysis. Some of these studies showed that the link between genotype and phenotype is not strictly deterministic. Mutations can change various statistical properties of a biochemical reaction, and thereby the probability of a trait outcome. The fact that they can modulate phenotypic noise brings up an intriguing question: how may selection act on these mutations? In this review, we approach this question by first covering the evidence that biological noise is under genetic control and therefore a substrate for evolution. We then sequentially inspect the possibilities of negative, neutral, and positive selection for mutations increasing biological noise. Finally, we hypothesize on the specific case of H2A.Z, which was shown to both buffer phenotypic noise and modulate transcriptional efficiency.",stochasticity;evolution;bet-hedging;nucleosome;phenotypic buffering

Here, we have investigated the role of PheB24, an invariant aromatic anchor at this interface and site of a human mutation causing diabetes mellitus. An extensive set of B24 substitutions has been constructed and tested for effects on receptor binding. Although aromaticity has long been considered a key requirement at this position, MetB24 was found to confer essentially native affinity and bioactivity. Molecular modeling suggests that this linear side chain can serve as an alternative hydrophobic anchor at the hormone-receptor interface. These findings motivated further substitution of PheB24 by cyclohexanylalanine (Cha), which contains a nonplanar aliphatic ring. Contrary to expectations, [ChaB24]insulin likewise exhibited high activity. Furthermore, its resistance to fibrillation and the rapid rate of hexamer disassembly, properties of potential therapeutic advantage, were enhanced. The crystal structure of the ChaB24 analog, determined as an R6 zinc-stabilized hexamer at a resolution of 1.5 Å, closely resembles that of wild-type insulin. The nonplanar aliphatic ring exhibits two chair conformations with partial occupancies, each recapitulating the role of PheB24 at the dimer interface. Together, these studies have defined structural requirements of an anchor residue within the B24-binding pocket of the insulin receptor; similar molecular principles are likely to pertain to insulin-related growth factors. Our results highlight in particular the utility of nonaromatic side chains as probes of the B24 pocket and suggest that the nonstandard Cha side chain may have therapeutic utility.",Diabetes;Mutagenesis;Protein Design;Protein Structure;Receptor Tyrosine Kinase;Hormone;nonstandard mutagenesis

Several studies support a role of MeCP2 in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and homeostasis. At the molecular level, MeCP2 is described as a repressor capable of inhibiting gene transcription through chromatin compaction. Indeed, it interacts with several chromatin remodeling factors, such as HDAC-containing complexes and ATRX. Other studies have inferred that MeCP2 functions also as an activator; a role in regulating mRNA splicing and in modulating protein synthesis has also been proposed. Further, MeCP2 avidly binds both 5-methyl- and 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine. Recent evidence suggests that it is the highly disorganized structure of MeCP2, together with its post-translational modifications (PTMs) that generate and regulate this functional versatility. Indeed, several reports have demonstrated that differential phosphorylation of MeCP2 is a key mechanism by which the methyl binding protein modulates its affinity for its partners, gene expression and cellular adaptations to stimuli and neuronal plasticity. As logic consequence, generation of phospho-defective Mecp2 knock-in mice has permitted associating alterations in neuronal morphology, circuit formation, and mouse behavioral phenotypes with specific phosphorylation events. MeCP2 undergoes various other PTMs, including acetylation, ubiquitination and sumoylation, whose functional roles remain largely unexplored. These results, together with the genome-wide distribution of MeCP2 and its capability to substitute histone H1, recall the complex regulation of histones and suggest the relevance of quickly gaining a deeper comprehension of MeCP2 PTMs, the respective writers and readers and the consequent functional outcomes.",chromatin;MeCP2;mouse models;phosphorylation;post-translational modifications;Rett syndrome;synaptic plasticity

Metal ions are especially important to familial ALS cases caused by mutations in the metalloenzyme copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1). To investigate the role of metals in aggregation of mutant SOD1, we have examined the localization of metal ions in a cell culture model of overexpression. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) were transfected to overexpress SOD1 fused to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) to readily identify the transfected cells and the intracellular aggregates that develop in the cells expressing mutant or wild-type (WT) SOD1. The concentration and distribution of iron, copper, and zinc were determined for four SOD1 mutants (A4V, G37R, H80R, and D125H) as well as a WT SOD1 using X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM). Results demonstrated that the SOD1 aggregates were metal-deficient within the cells, which is consistent with recent in vitro studies. In addition, all SOD1 mutants showed significantly decreased copper content compared to the WT SOD1 cells, regardless of the mutant’s ability to bind copper. These results suggest that SOD1 overexpression creates an unmet demand on the cell for copper. This is particularly true for the SOD1 mutants where copper delivery may also be impaired. Hence, the SOD1 mutants are less stable than WT SOD1 and if copper is limited, aggregate formation of the metal-deficient, mutant SOD1 protein occurs.",amyotrophic lateral sclerosis;superoxide dismutase;X-ray fluorescence microscopy;synchrotron

We used human Tau purified from yeast models to generate new monoclonal antibodies, of which three were further characterized. The first antibody, ADx201, binds the Tau proline-rich region independently of the phosphorylation status, whereas the second, ADx215, detects an epitope formed by the Tau N terminus when Tau is not phosphorylated at Tyr18. For the third antibody, ADx210, the binding site could not be determined because its epitope is probably conformational. All three antibodies stained tangle-like structures in different brain sections of THY-Tau22 transgenic mice and Alzheimer patients, and ADx201 and ADx210 also detected neuritic plaques in the cortex of the patient brains. In hippocampal homogenates from THY-Tau22 mice and cortex homogenates obtained from Alzheimer patients, ADx215 consistently stained specific low order Tau oligomers in diseased brain, which in size correspond to Tau dimers. ADx201 and ADx210 additionally reacted to higher order Tau oligomers and presumed prefibrillar structures in the patient samples. Our data further suggest that formation of the low order Tau oligomers marks an early disease stage that is initiated by Tau phosphorylation at N-terminal sites. Formation of higher order oligomers appears to require additional phosphorylation in the C terminus of Tau. When used to assess Tau levels in human cerebrospinal fluid, the antibodies permitted us to discriminate patients with Alzheimer disease or other dementia like vascular dementia, indicative that these antibodies hold promising diagnostic potential.",Alzheimer Disease;Antibody;Protein Folding;Tau Protein (Tau);Yeast;Protein Oligomer

Tau isoforms are developmentally regulated and have been shown to have disparate effects on microtubule polymerization, the ability to bind microtubules, and the ability to inhibit kinesin. It has also been shown that Tau is sensitive to microtubule stabilizing agents and the ability to affect the persistence length of microtubules and to inhibit kinesin can be altered by stabilizing microtubules with various nucleotide analogs. Given these observations, it is likely the behavior of Tau is dictated by both the isoform of Tau and by structural changes in the microtubule lattice. In the present study, we use single molecule imaging to examine the behavior of the three-repeat short (3RS) isoform and the four-repeat long (4RL) isoform on different microtubule tracks stabilized with either paclitaxel or guanylyl-(α, β)-methylene-diphosphate (GMPCPP). On paclitaxel-stabilized microtubules, we find 3RS-Tau favors the static conformation and forms complexes consisting of 2–3 molecules, while 4RL-Tau predominantly exists as a single molecule equally distributed between the static and diffusing populations. However, on GMPCPP-stabilized microtubules both isoforms favor the diffusing conformation and do not form static complexes composed of more than one Tau molecule. We find both isoforms of Tau interconvert between static and diffusing populations on the microtubule surface, and the equilibrium between these two states depends on both the isoform of Tau and the structure of the underlying microtubule lattice.",Tau;microtubule;cytoskeleton;neuron;kinesin;nucleotide

Long-lived peptide presentation is important for efficient antigen-specific T-cell activation. Presentation time depends on the peptide sequence and the stability of the peptide-HLA complex (pHLA). However, the determinant of peptide-dependent pHLA stability remains elusive. Here, to reveal the pHLA stabilization mechanism, we examined the crystal structures of an HLA class I allomorph in complex with HIV-derived peptides and evaluated site-specific conformational fluctuations using NMR. Although the crystal structures of various pHLAs were almost identical independent of the peptides, fluctuation analyses identified a peptide-dependent minor state that would be more tightly packed toward the peptide. The minor population correlated well with the thermostability and cell surface presentation of pHLA, indicating that this newly identified minor state is important for stabilizing the pHLA and facilitating T-cell recognition.",Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC);Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR);Protein Dynamic;Protein Stability;Thermodynamics

The virus initially assembles at pH 7.6 into a marginally stable 480-Å procapsid formed by 240 copies of a single type of protein subunit. During maturation, which occurs during apoptosis at pH 5.0, electrostatic forces guide subunit trajectories into a robust 410-Å virion that is buttressed by subunit associated molecular switches. We discuss the competing factors in the virus capsid of requiring near-reversible interactions during initial assembly to avoid kinetic traps, while requiring robust stability to survive in the extra-cellular environment. In addition, viruses have a variety of mechanisms to deliver the genome, which must remain off while still inside the infected cell, yet turn on under the proper conditions of infection. We conclude that maturation is the process that provides a solution to these conflicting requirements through a program that is encoded in the procapsid and that leads to stability and infectivity.",virus maturation;quasi-equivalence;Nudaurelia capensis omega virus;autoproteolysis;tetravirus;RNA insect virus;non-enveloped viruses

focus in understanding a group of neurodegenerative disorders called
α-synucleinopathies, which are characterized by the presence of aggregated
α-synuclein intracellularly. Primary α-synucleinopathies include
Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system
atrophy, with α-synuclein also found secondarily in a number of other diseases,
including Alzheimer’s disease. Understanding how α-synuclein aggregates
form in these different disorders is important for the understanding of its
pathogenesis in Lewy body diseases. PD is the most prevalent of the
α-synucleinopathies and much of the initial research on α-synuclein Lewy
body pathology was based on PD but is also relevant to Lewy bodies in other diseases
(dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer’s disease). Polymorphism and mutation
studies of SNCA, the gene that encodes α-synuclein, provide much
evidence for a causal link between α-synuclein and PD. Among the primary
α-synucleinopathies, multiple system atrophy is unique in that α-synuclein
deposition occurs in oligodendrocytes rather than neurons. It is unclear whether
α-synuclein originates from oligodendrocytes or whether it is transmitted
somehow from neurons. α-Synuclein exists as a natively unfolded monomer in the
cytosol, but in the presence of lipid membranes it is thought to undergo a
conformational change to a folded α-helical secondary structure that is prone to
forming dimers and oligomers. Posttranslational modification of α-synuclein,
such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination and nitration, has been widely implicated in
α-synuclein aggregation process and neurotoxicity. Recent studies using animal
and cell models, as well as autopsy studies of patients with neuron transplants,
provided compelling evidence for prion-like propagation of α-synuclein. This
observation has implications for therapeutic strategies, and much recent effort is
focused on developing antibodies that target extracellular α-synuclein.",

This behavior is driven by GTP hydrolysis in the microtubule lattice, and is inhibited by anticancer agents like Taxol. We provide new insight into the mechanism of dynamic instability, based on high-resolution cryo-EM structures (4.7–5.6 Å) of dynamic microtubules and microtubules stabilized by GMPCPP or Taxol. We infer that hydrolysis leads to a compaction around the E-site nucleotide at longitudinal interfaces, as well as movement of the α–tubulin intermediate domain and H7 helix. Displacement of the C-terminal helices in both α– and β–tubulin subunits suggests an effect on interactions with binding partners that contact this region. Taxol inhibits most of these conformational changes, allosterically inducing a GMPCPP-like state. Lateral interactions are similar in all conditions we examined, suggesting that microtubule lattice stability is primarily modulated at longitudinal interfaces.",

However, in high-income countries overuse of antibiotics, changes in diet, and elimination of constitutive partners such as nematodes has selected for a microbiota that lack the resilience and diversity required to establish balanced immune responses.

Through binding to the extracellular domain of the IR, 4548-G05 induces activation of the receptor and initiates the downstream Akt and extracellular signal–related kinase pathways to trigger glucose uptake in C2C12 myotubes.

a multiple structure alignment of all protein kinase structures (Figure ​(Figure1B).1B). The DFG-out structures are generally less compact
than the DFG-in structures. For example, the N-lobe of DFG-out structure
adopts a relatively wide range of conformations, as shown by the range
of αC-helix positions (Figure ​(Figure1B).1B). The
alignment indicates that the β-hairpin preceding the DFG-motif
is structurally conserved, even in atypical kinases, and the majority
of the DFG-out structures have similar DFG-motif conformation. Specifically,
the Asp and Phe of the DFG-motif, which we defined as the (D) and
(D + 1) residues (Methods), respectively,
are flipped by approximately 180° in relation to DFG-in structures,
whereas the side chain of the (D + 1) residue points away from the
hydrophobic DFG-pocket (Figure ​(Figure1B).1B). The conformation
of the DFG-motif and the overall position of the A-loop may be correlated,
although it may not be the determinant factor of A-loop secondary
structure (Figure S3). Because the A-loop
does not take part in forming the DFG-out binding site, the conformation
of the A-loop may not be critical for type-II ligand binding. Furthermore,
the DFG-flip does not change the overall structure of the C-lobe.
This analysis provides a structural framework to generate DFG-out
models for kinases with no known DFG-out structures. Particularly,
to account for the conformation changes in the N-lobe upon the DFG-flip,
we hypothesize that a diverse set of kinase structures in DFG-out
conformations with distinct N-lobe conformations, especially the αC-helix
and glycine-rich loop, could be used as templates for modeling.",

We use fluorescence resonance energy transfer reporters in live cells to follow conformational transitions that tune the affinity of a multi-domain signal transducer, protein kinase C, for optimal response to second messengers. This enzyme comprises two diacylglycerol sensors, the C1A and C1B domains, whose intrinsic affinity for ligand is sufficiently high that the enzyme would be in a ligand-engaged, active state if not for mechanisms that mask its domains. We show that both diacylglycerol sensors are exposed in newly-synthesized protein kinase C and that conformational transitions following priming phosphorylations mask the domains such that the lower affinity sensor, the C1B domain, is the primary diacylglycerol binder. Protein kinase C's conformational rearrangements serve as a paradigm for how multi-module transducers optimize their dynamic range of signaling.",optimized signaling;conformational transitions;fluorescence resonance energy transfer;protein kinase C;C1 domain

This provides evidence that dysregulated NOD2 signaling, genetic or functional in nature, predisposes to chronic intestinal inflammation, and supports a new paradigm that CD may occur from a deficit in innate immunity as opposed to an overly aggressive immune response.

The pathogenesis of this cancer remains poorly elucidated. Previous studies focused on analysis of expression and function of known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. However, emerging reports highlight that it is also important to analyze the expression of genes that are ectopically expressed in CTCL (e.g., embryonic stem cell genes (ESC), cancer testis (CT) genes, etc.). Currently, it is not known whether ESC genes are expressed in CTCL. In the current work, we analyze by RT-PCR the expression of 26 ESC genes, many of which are known to regulate pluripotency and promote cancer stem cell-like phenotype, in a historic cohort of 60 patients from Boston and in a panel of 11 patient-derived CTCL cell lines and compare such expression to benign inflammatory dermatoses that often clinically mimic CTCL. Our findings document that many critical ESC genes including NANOG, SOX2, OCT4 (POU5F1) and their upstream and downstream signaling members are expressed in CTCL. Similarly, polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) genes (i.e., EZH2, EED, and SUZ12) are also expressed in CTCL lesional skin. Furthermore, select ESC genes (OCT4, EED, TCF3, THAP11, CHD7, TIP60, TRIM28) are preferentially expressed in CTCL samples when compared to benign skin biopsies. Our work suggests that ESC genes are ectopically expressed together with CT genes, thymocyte development genes and B cell-specific genes and may be working in concert to promote tumorigenesis. Specifically, while ESC genes may be promoting cancer stem cell-like phenotype, CT genes may be contributing to aneuploidy and genomic instability by producing aberrant chromosomal translocations. Further analysis of ESC expression and function in this cancer will greatly enhance our fundamental understanding of CTCL and will help us identify novel therapeutic targets.",cancer testis genes;cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL);embryonic stem cell genes;mycosis fungoides (MF);polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2);sézary syndrome (SS);thymocyte development genes

The method, termed parametrically constrained spectrum analysis (PCSA), provides an optimized approach for simultaneously modeling heterogeneity in size and anisotropy of macromolecular mixtures. The solutions produced by PCSA are particularly useful for modeling polymerizing systems, where a single-valued relationship exists between the molar mass of the growing polymer chain and its corresponding anisotropy. The PCSA uses functional constraints to identify this relationship, and unlike other multidimensional grid methods, assures that only a single molar mass can be associated with a given anisotropy measurement. A description of the PCSA algorithm is presented, as well as several experimental and simulated examples that illustrate its utility and capabilities. The performance advantages of the PCSA method in comparison to other methods are documented.

Escherichia coli, kill other E. coli, have
become much better understood in recent years. Most colicins initially bind to
an outer membrane protein receptor, and then search for a separate nearby outer
membrane protein translocator that serves as a pathway into target cells. Many
colicins use the outer membrane porin, OmpF, as that translocator, while using a
different primary receptor. Colicin N is unique among known colicins in that
only OmpF had been identified as being required for uptake of the colicin and it
was presumed to somehow serve as both receptor and translocator. Genetic screens
also identified a number of genes required for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
synthesis as uniquely required for killing by colicin N, but not by other
colicins. In this issue of Molecular Microbiology, Johnson et
al. show that the receptor-binding domain of colicin N binds to
LPS, and does not require OmpF for that binding. LPS of a minimal length is
required for binding, explaining the requirement for specific elements of the
LPS biosynthetic pathway. For colicin N, the receptor-binding domain does not
recognize a protein, but rather the most abundant component of the outer
membrane itself, LPS.",colicin;lipopolysaccharide;membrane translocation;receptors;porin

are addressing bacterial resistance to antibiotics by repurposing
a well-established classic antimicrobial target, the dihydrofolate
reductase (DHFR) enzyme. In this work, we have focused on Enterococcus faecalis, a nosocomial pathogen that frequently
harbors antibiotic resistance determinants leading to complicated
and difficult-to-treat infections. An inhibitor series with a hydrophobic
dihydrophthalazine heterocycle was designed from the anti-folate trimethoprim.
We have examined the potency of this inhibitor series based on inhibition
of DHFR enzyme activity and bacterial growth, including in the presence
of the exogenous product analogue folinic acid. The resulting preferences
were rationalized using a cocrystal structure of the DHFR from this
organism with a propyl-bearing series member (RAB-propyl). In a companion
apo structure, we identify four buried waters that act as placeholders
for a conserved hydrogen-bonding network to the substrate and indicate
an important role in protein stability during catalytic cycling. In
these structures, the nicotinamide of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate cofactor is visualized outside of its binding pocket, which
is exacerbated by RAB-propyl binding. Finally, homology models of
the TMPR sequences dfrK and dfrF were constructed. While the dfrK-encoded protein
shows clear sequence changes that would be detrimental to inhibitor
binding, the dfrF-encoded protein model suggests
the protein would be relatively unstable. These data suggest a utility
for anti-DHFR compounds for treating infections arising from E. faecalis. They also highlight a role for water in stabilizing
the DHFR substrate pocket and for competitive substrate inhibitors
that may gain advantages in potency by the perturbation of cofactor
dynamics.",

Further reports showed RCM dependent alterations of erythrocytes like echinocyte formation and exocytosis, sequestration of actin or band 3 and the buckling of endothelial cells coinciding with a formation of interendothelial fenestrations leading to areas devoid of endothelial cells.

The central building block of this bridge is the Chinese medical concept of zheng 證/証, variously translated into English as syndrome, pattern, or type. My paper places side by side two different genealogies of how zheng assumed this central role. The first genealogy examines the process by means of which zheng came to be considered as something shared by both ancient China and cutting-edge biological science and, by extension, how it manages to hold together the entire institutional, political, and economic framework into which this bridge is embedded and which it co-creates. The second genealogy shows zheng to be central to a much older series of redefinitions of Chinese medicine and Chinese medical practice that extend from the eleventh century to the present. Read together, these two genealogies—neither of which should be seen as exhaustive—raise three important issues that are further discussed in the conclusion of the paper. First, I explore how the concept of zheng has come to tie a medical tradition derided by its adversaries for being a pseudoscience to one of the most cutting-edge fields of bioscience research. I ask what is at stake in this synthesis, for whom, and why, and how it transforms Chinese medicine and/or systems biology along the way. Second, I am interested in finding out how and why the very same concept can be at the heart of two apparently agonistic visions of Chinese medicine’s future as it is popularly imagined in China today. Finally, I insist that the medical humanities need to become actively involved in the construction of emergent articulations such as the ones I am exploring. Merely writing a history of the present will not be productive unless its critique can somehow be articulated into the very processes of emergence that historians or anthropologists seek to examine.",bioscience;boundary objects;Chinese medicine;genealogy;medical humanities;systems biology;trading zones

Experimental heat capacity curves are reproduced markedly well, and an analysis of quantitative stability/flexibility relationships (QSFR) is applied to a representative VL domain and several complexes in the scFv and Fab forms. Global flexibility in the denatured ensemble typically decreases in the larger complexes due to domain-domain interfaces. Slight decreases in global flexibility also occur in the native state of the larger fragments, but with a concurrent large increase in correlated flexibility. Typically, a VL fragment has more co-rigid residue pairs when isolated compared to the scFv and Fab forms, where correlated flexibility appears upon complex formation. This context dependence on residue-residue couplings in the VL domain across length scales of a complex is consistent with the evolutionary hypothesis of antibody maturation. In comparing two scFv mutants with similar thermodynamic stability, local and long-ranged changes in backbone flexibility are observed. In the case of anti-p24 HIV-1 Fab, a variety of QSFR metrics were found to be atypical, which includes comparatively greater co-flexibility in the VH domain and less co-flexibility in the VL domain.

The incidence of mal-union and failed joint replacements in the elderly is even higher, as a result of inadequate endogenous healing mechanisms. There is a pressing need for innovative approaches to promote bone repair in cases where healing is predicted to be compromised. This will reduce the number of failed procedures and significantly reduce the economic burden associated with musculoskeletal disease in Canada. Although the primary role ascribed to mast cells is that of protagonist in allergic reactions, there is growing evidence that they also play pivotal roles in normal physiology. A number of early studies noted accumulation of mast cells in and around fracture callus. We tested the hypothesis that mast cells are involved in all phases of fracture repair. We tested the hypothesis that mast cells are involved in fracture repair by comparing bone repair in uni-cortical femoral window defects in mast cell deficient C57BL/6-KitW-sh/W-shmice and their wild type littermates. Cohorts of mice were euthanized at timed intervals (2, 4, 6 and 12 weeks) after surgery and bone healing was quantified using micro CT and histological analyses. Bone mineral content was analyzed with von Kossa stain, and alkaline phosphatase and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase was used to assess osteoblasts and osteoclasts activity respectively. Acidic toluidine blue staining identified mast cells with a high degree of specificity and safranin O and alizarin red stain was used to assess their stage of maturity. Bone regeneration in the mast cell deficient mice is significantly delayed and associated with an abnormal spatial distribution of the new bone, which led to non-unions in half of the cases. Less bone was found at the level of the cortex and more bone inside the medullary cavity. The quality of the regenerating cortical bone was lower in the mast cell deficient mice, as indicated by higher porosity, less osteocytes, lower connectivity and impaired trabecular characteristics. The histological analyses confirmed the poor quality bone shown by micro CT and suggested it may be due to uncoupling of osteoblast from osteoclast activity. The changing maturity, number and distribution of mast cells throughout the process of healing indicate that the role of mast cells depends on the stage of bone regeneration.",

A critical p27Kip1 feature is the lack of a stable tertiary structure that enhances its “adaptability” to different interactors and explains the heterogeneity of its function. The absence of a well-defined folding underlines the importance of p27Kip1 post-translational modifications that might highly impact the protein functions. Here, we characterize the metabolism and CDK interaction of phosphoserine10-p27Kip1 (pS10- p27Kip1), the major phosphoisoform of p27Kip1. By an experimental strategy based on specific immunoprecipitation and bidimensional electrophoresis, we established that pS10-p27Kip1 is mainly bound to cyclin E/CDK2 rather than to cyclin A/CDK2. pS10- p27Kip1 is more stable than non-modified p27Kip1, since it is not (or scarcely) phosphorylated on T187, the post-translational modification required for p27Kip1 removal in the nucleus. pS10-p27Kip1 does not bind CDK1. The lack of this interaction might represent a mechanism for facilitating CDK1 activation and allowing mitosis completion. In conclusion, we suggest that nuclear p27Kip1 follows 2 almost independent pathways operating at different rates. One pathway involves threonine-187 and tyrosine phosphorylations and drives the protein toward its Skp2-dependent removal. The other involves serine-10 phosphorylation and results in the elongation of p27Kip1 half-life and specific CDK interactions. Thus, pS10-p27Kip1, due to its stability, might be thought as a major responsible for the p27Kip1-dependent arrest of cells in G1/G0 phase.",cyclin-depedent kinases regulation;p27Kip1;p27Kip1 metabolism;p27Kip1 modifications

did not increase unwrapping.108 However,
since different histone tails appear to have opposite impacts on nucleosome
unwrapping dynamics,91 the extent to which
unwrapping dynamics is influenced by tail acetylation remains unclear.
Another complication is that histone tails also influence chromatin
higher-order structure both within and between fibers. Histone tail
interactions with DNA and the histone core are different in extended,
compacted, and aggregated nucleosome arrays.47,109−111 This suggests that single-nucleosome studies
are relevant for nucleosome dynamics within extended euchromatic fibers
but that the influence of histone tails and their PTMs on unwrapping
dynamics within heterochromatin needs to be investigated within nucleosome
arrays. To elucidate how nucleosome unwrapping and DNA site exposure
are influenced by histone tail modifications, future quantitative
studies will need to be performed with nucleosomes containing well-defined
patterns of histone PTMs in chromatin fibers.",

Although our knowledge about alternative splicing is growing exponentially, its real impact on cellular life is still to be clarified. Connecting all splicing features (genes, splice transcripts, isoforms, and relative functions) may be useful to resolve this tangle. Herein, we will start from the case of a single gene, Parkinson protein 2, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (PARK2), one of the largest in our genome. This gene is implicated in the pathogenesis of autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism and it has been recently linked to cancer, leprosy, autism, type 2 diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer’s disease. PARK2 primary transcript undergoes an extensive alternative splicing, which enhances transcriptomic diversification and protein diversity in tissues and cells. This review will provide an update of all human PARK2 alternative splice transcripts and isoforms presently known, and correlate them to those in rat and mouse, two common animal models for studying human disease genes. Alternative splicing relies upon a complex process that could be easily altered by both cis and trans-acting mutations. Although the contribution of PARK2 splicing in human disease remains to be fully explored, some evidences show disruption of this versatile form of genetic regulation may have pathological consequences.",Alternative splicing;mRNA;PARK2;Protein isoforms;Splice variants;Splice expression patterns.

There are four homologous isoforms (HCN1–4) sharing a common multidomain architecture that includes an N-terminal transmembrane tetrameric ion channel followed by a cytoplasmic “C-linker,” which connects a more distal cAMP-binding domain (CBD) to the inner pore. Channel opening is primarily stimulated by transmembrane elements that sense membrane hyperpolarization, although cAMP reduces the voltage required for HCN activation by promoting tetramerization of the intracellular C-linker, which in turn relieves auto-inhibition of the inner pore gate. Although binding of cAMP has been proposed to relieve auto-inhibition by affecting the structure of the C-linker and CBD, the nature and extent of these cAMP-dependent changes remain limitedly explored. Here, we used NMR to probe the changes caused by the binding of cAMP and of cCMP, a partial agonist, to the apo-CBD of HCN4. Our data indicate that the CBD exists in a dynamic two-state equilibrium, whose position as gauged by NMR chemical shifts correlates with the V½ voltage measured through electrophysiology. In the absence of cAMP, the most populated CBD state leads to steric clashes with the activated or “tetrameric” C-linker, which becomes energetically unfavored. The steric clashes of the apo tetramer are eliminated either by cAMP binding, which selects for a CBD state devoid of steric clashes with the tetrameric C-linker and facilitates channel opening, or by a transition of apo-HCN to monomers or dimer of dimers, in which the C-linker becomes less structured, and channel opening is not facilitated.",Allosteric Regulation;Cyclic AMP (cAMP);Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR);Protein Conformation;Signaling;HCN;Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs);Allostery;cAMP-binding Domain (CBD);cCMP

Using magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we provide the first detailed look at the dynamic properties of these forms over a broad range of timescales. We establish that different prions strains have distinct amyloid structures, with many side chains in different chemical environments.

Although this distribution affects the fluorescence signal under polarized-light excitation, its retrieval is limited to a small number of parameters. Because of this limitation, the need for a geometrical model (cone, Gaussian, etc.) to effect such retrieval is often invoked. In this work, using a symmetry decomposition of the distribution function of the fluorescent molecules, we show that polarized two-photon fluorescence based on tunable linear dichroism allows for the retrieval of this distribution with reasonable fidelity and without invoking either an a priori knowledge of the system to be investigated or a geometrical model. We establish the optimal level of detail to which any distribution can be retrieved using this technique. As applied to artificial lipid vesicles and cell membranes, the ability of this method to identify and quantify specific structural properties that complement the more traditional molecular-order information is demonstrated. In particular, we analyze situations that give access to the sharpness of the angular constraint, and to the evidence of an isotropic population of fluorophores within the focal volume encompassing the membrane. Moreover, this technique has the potential to address complex situations such as the distribution of a tethered membrane protein label in an ordered environment.",

Accordingly, enforced expression of SKI induced a gene signature associated with hematopoietic stem cells and myeloid differentiation, as well as hepatocyte growth factor signaling. Here we demonstrate that, in contrast to what has generally been assumed, the significant impact of SKI on hematopoiesis is independent of its ability to inhibit TGF-beta signaling.

To account for this diversity, personalized medicine is developed for silencing malignancy associated genes. Nano drugs fit these needs by targeting tumor and delivering antisense oligonucleotides for silencing of genes. As drugs for the treatment are often administered repeatedly, absence of toxicity and negligible immune response are desirable. In the example presented here, a nano medicine is synthesized from the biodegradable, non-toxic and non-immunogenic platform polymalic acid by controlled chemical ligation of antisense oligonucleotides and tumor targeting molecules. The synthesis and treatment is exemplified for human Her2-positive breast cancer using an experimental mouse model. The case can be translated towards synthesis and treatment of other tumors.",Chemistry;Issue 88;Cancer treatment;personalized medicine;polymalic acid;nanodrug;biopolymer;targeting;host compatibility;biodegradability

Here, we report the remarkable deterioration of a characteristic mammalian maternal behavior, pup retrieval, in nonmammalized mice, in which the transcription factor Pou3f2 was replaced with the Xenopus ortholog lacking all of the homopolymeric amino acid repeats of mammalian POU3F2. Most of the pups born to the nonmammalized mice died within days after birth, depending on the dam genotype alone. Quantitative immunohistochemical analysis revealed decreases in the rate-limiting enzymes of dopamine and serotonin synthesis in various brain structures. Similar results were obtained in knock-in mice in which all of the homopolymeric amino acid repeats of mammalian POU3F2 were removed. Pup retrieval behavior in mammals is thus strongly related to monoamine neurotransmitter levels via the acquisition of homopolymeric amino acid repeats during mammalian evolution.",nonmammalized mice;amino acid repeats;transcription factor;Pou3f2/Brn-2;maternal behavior

Queuosine is almost universally found at the wobble position of the anticodon in asparaginyl, tyrosyl, histidyl and aspartyl tRNAs, where it contributes to translational fidelity. Two classes of PreQ1 riboswitches have been identified (PreQ1-I and PreQ1-II), and structures of examples from both classes have been determined. Both classes form H-type pseudoknots upon PreQ1 binding, each of which has distinct unusual features and modes of PreQ1 recognition. These features include an unusually long loop 2 in PreQ1-I pseudoknots and an embedded hairpin in loop 3 in PreQ1-II pseudoknots. PreQ1-I riboswitches are also notable for their unusually small aptamer domain, which has been extensively investigated by NMR, X-ray crystallography, FRET, and other biophysical methods.

Multiphoton microscopy offers several advantages over competing microscopy techniques: there is an inherent axial sectioning, penetration depths that compete well with confocal microscopy on account of the use of near-infrared light, and many two-photon contrast mechanisms, such as second-harmonic generation, have no analogue in one-photon microscopy. While the penetration depths of photons into tissue are typically limited on the order of hundreds of microns, this is of less concern in dermatology, as the skin is thin and readily accessible. As a result, multiphoton microscopy in dermatology has generated a great deal of interest, much of which is summarized here. The review covers the interaction of light and tissue, as well as the various considerations that must be made when designing an instrument. The state of multiphoton microscopy in imaging skin cancer and various other diseases is also discussed, along with the investigation of aging and regeneration phenomena, and finally, the use of multiphoton microscopy to analyze the transdermal transport of drugs, cosmetics and other agents is summarized. The review concludes with a look at potential future research directions, especially those that are necessary to push these techniques into widespread clinical acceptance.",Multiphoton microscopy;skin;cancer;aging and regeneration

data establish a hydrogen bond network
between residues 731–730–439 in the α2 subunit.
The observed hydrogen bonds and directions provide very strong support
for a colinear PCET mechanism, consistent with the recent finding
that the turnover rate constants within α are very fast, >14000
s–1, when conformational gating from β is
removed by photoinitation.30 These results
differ dramatically from the PCET process at the α/β interface
and within β. Our data indicate that colinear PCET and π
stacking between Y356 and Y731 are unlikely,
and also reveal the importance of the electrostatic protein environment.
Additional spectroscopic experiments could be informative, but structural
insight is also essential. Within α2 the combination of protein
engineering, spectroscopic data, and quantum chemical calculations
has provided much insight into the PCET process within this subunit.
Nature appears to have utilized multiple PCET strategies to achieve
this long-range oxidation over 35 Å.",

Amyloid fiber aggregation of IAPP has been correlated with the dysfunction and death of these cells in type II diabetics. The likely mechanisms by which IAPP gains toxic function include energy independent cell membrane penetration and induction of membrane depolarization. These processes have been correlated with solution biophysical observations of lipid bilayer catalyzed acceleration of amyloid formation. Although the relationship between amyloid formation and toxicity is poorly understood, the fact that conditions promoting one also favor the other suggests related membrane active structural states. Here, a novel high throughput screening protocol is described that capitalizes on this correlation to identify compounds that target membrane active species. Applied to a small library of 960 known bioactive compounds, we are able to report identification of 37 compounds of which 36 were not previously reported as active toward IAPP fiber formation. Several compounds tested in secondary cell viability assays also demonstrate cytoprotective effects. It is a general observation that peptide induced toxicity in several amyloid diseases (such as Alzhiemer’s and Parkinson’s) involves a membrane bound, preamyloid oligomeric species. Our data here suggest that a screening protocol based on lipid-catalyzed assembly will find mechanistically informative small molecule hits in this subclass of amyloid diseases.",IAPP;amylin;toxicity;small molecules;HTF;high throughput screen;amyloid;Type 2 diabetes;lipids

Therefore, we performed the immunohistochemical analysis of PCP4 in the following tissues: normal adrenal (NA; n=15), APA (n=15), cortisol producing adenomas (CPA; n=15) and idiopathic hyperaldosteronism cases (IHA; n=5). APA samples (n=45) were also submitted to quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) of PCP4, CYP11B1, and CYP11B2, as well as DNA sequencing for KCNJ5 mutations. Transient transfection analysis using PCP4 siRNA was also performed in H295R adrenocortical carcinoma cells, following ELISA analysis, and CYP11B2 luciferase assays were also performed after PCP4 vector transfection in order to study the regulation of PCP4 protein expression. In our findings, PCP4 immunoreactivity was predominantly detected in APA and in the zona glomerulosa (ZG) of NA and IHA. In APA, the mRNA levels of PCP4 were significantly correlated with those of CYP11B2 (P<0.0001) and were significantly higher in cases with KCNJ5 mutation than wild-type (P=0.005). Following PCP4 vector transfection, CYP11B2 luciferase reporter activity was significantly higher than controls in the presence of angiotensin-II. Knockdown of PCP4 resulted in a significant decrease in CYP11B2 mRNA levels (P=0.012) and aldosterone production (P=0.011).

Base substitutions at highly conserved residues in the central pseudoknot of 16S rRNA produce novel hydrogen-bonding and base-stacking interactions.

Initially localized to the dorsal neural folds, premigratory neural crest cells undergo an epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT) and migrate to their final destinations in the developing embryo. Together with epidermally-derived placode cells, neural crest cells then form the cranial sensory ganglia of the peripheral nervous system. Our prior work has shown that αN-catenin, the neural subtype of the adherens junction α-catenin protein, regulates cranial neural crest cell EMT by controlling premigratory neural crest cell cadherin levels. Although αN-catenin down-regulation is critical for initial neural crest cell EMT, a potential role for αN-catenin in later neural crest cell migration, and formation of the cranial ganglia, has not been examined. In this study, we show for the first time that migratory neural crest cells that will give rise to the cranial trigeminal ganglia express αN-catenin and Cadherin-7. αN-catenin loss-and gain-of-function experiments reveal effects on the migratory neural crest cell population that include subsequent defects in trigeminal ganglia assembly. Moreover, αN-catenin perturbation in neural crest cells impacts the placode cell contribution to the trigeminal ganglia and also changes neural crest cell Cadherin-7 levels and localization.

Continuing on the path set in a previous work, we increased the capabilities of the code by implementing a number of new features, including: a non-iterative algorithm for rigid trigonal molecule simulations; two additional temperature coupling schemes; a meta-dynamics based approach for effective free energy evaluations. Although these are well known algorithms, each present in one or more widely used MD packages, they have now been tested, for the first time, in the context of the FQ model coupled with NPBC. As case studies, we considered three aqueous ions of increasing charge, namely Na+, Ca2+ and La3+, at infinite dilution. In particular, by exploiting a computational approach recently proposed by our group and based on the metadynamics technique, we focused on the important role played by solvent polarization on ionic hydration structures, also investigating the free energy landscapes of ion coordination and the water exchange rates. Such an approach, previously tested with standard non-polarizable models, was applied here to evaluate the effects of explicit polarization on water exchange barriers between different solvent coordination structures. Moreover, we have analyzed and discussed in some detail non-linear electrostatic effects arising from solvent polarization while going from a mono- to a di- and trivalent ion.",Molecular Dynamics;polarization;aqueous ions

Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation approach, we examined histone acetylation status on the lysine residues H3K9/14, H3K18, total H4, and H4K16 at the NIS promoter under the influence of BRAF V600E. We found that expression of stably or transiently transfected BRAF V600E inhibited NIS expression while the deacetylase inhibitor SAHA stimulated NIS expression in PCCL3 rat thyroid cells. Although BRAF V600E enhanced global histone acetylation, it caused histone deacetylation at the NIS promoter while SAHA caused acetylation in the cells. In human thyroid cancer BCPAP cells harboring homozygous BRAF V600E mutation, BRAF V600E inhibitor, PLX4032, and MEK inhibitor, AZD6244, increased histone acetylation of the NIS promoter, suggesting that BRAF V600E normally maintained histone in a deacetylated state at the NIS promoter. The regions most commonly affected with deacetylation by BRAF V600E were the transcriptionally active areas upstream of the translation start that contained important transcription factor binding sites, including nucleotides −297/−107 in the rat NIS promoter and −692/−370 in the human NIS promoter. Our findings not only reveal an epigenetic mechanism for BRAF V600E-promoted NIS silencing involving histone deacetylation at critical regulatory regions of the NIS promoter but also provide further support for our previously proposed combination therapy targeting major signaling pathways and histone deacetylase to restore thyroid gene expression for radioiodine treatment of thyroid cancer.",thyroid cancer;NIS gene;BRAF V600E mutation;histone acetylation;histone deacetylation;radioiodine

Time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements yield such data, but the more readily available kinetics of mean FRET efficiency changes cannot be analyzed in terms of changes in distances because of the sixth-power dependence on the mean distance. To enhance the information obtained from mean FRET efficiency kinetics, we combined the analyses of FRET efficiency kinetics and equilibrium trFRET experiments. The joint analysis enabled determination of transient distance distributions along the folding reaction both in cases where a two-state transition is valid and in some cases consisting of a three-state scenario. The procedure and its limits were tested by simulations. Experimental data obtained from stopped-flow measurements of the refolding of Escherichia coli adenylate kinase were analyzed. The distance distributions between three double-labeled mutants, in the collapsed transient state, were determined and compared to those obtained experimentally using the double-kinetics technique. The proposed method effectively provides information on distance distributions of kinetically accessed intermediates of fast conformational transitions induced by common relaxation methods.",

β-hairpin peptides into fibrillar networks has emerged as a
novel route to form responsive hydrogels. Herein, computational modeling
techniques are used to investigate the relative arrangements of individual
hairpins within the fibrils that constitute the gel. The modeling
provides insight into the morphology of the fibril network, which
defines the gel’s mechanical properties. Our study suggests
polymorphic arrangements of the hairpins within the fibrils; however,
the relative populations and the relative conformational energies
of the polymorphic arrangements show a preference toward an arrangement
of hairpins where their turn regions are not capable of forming intermolecular
interaction. Repulsive intramolecular electrostatic interactions appear
to dictate the formation of fibrils with shorter, rather than longer,
persistent lengths. These repulsive intramolecular interactions also
disfavor the formation of fibril entanglements. Taken together, the
modeling predicts that MAX1 forms a network containing a large number
of branch points, a network morphology supported by the formation
of short fibril segments. We posit that, under static conditions,
the preferred branched structures of the MAX1 peptide assembly result
in a cross-linked hydrogel organization. At the same time, the shear

sudden external perturbation, or by intrinsic fluctuations of a few molecules. Here we show that the
two ideas can be combined to measure protein folding kinetics, either by periodic thermal
modulation, or by creating artificial thermal noise that greatly exceeds natural thermal
fluctuations. We study the folding reaction of the enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase driven by periodic
temperature waveforms. As the temperature waveform unfolds and refolds the protein, its fluorescence
color changes due to FRET (Förster resonant Energy Transfer) of two donor/acceptor fluorophores
labeling the protein. We adapt a simple model of periodically driven kinetics that nicely fits the
data at all temperatures and driving frequencies: The phase shifts of the periodic donor and
acceptor fluorescence signals as a function of driving frequency reveal reaction rates. We also
drive the reaction with stochastic temperature waveforms that produce thermal fluctuations much
greater than natural fluctuations in the bulk. Such artificial thermal noise allows the recovery of
weak underlying signals due to protein folding kinetics. This opens up the possibility for future
detection of a stochastic resonance for protein folding subject to noise with controllable
amplitude.",

The diverse T cell repertoire and the extensive human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphism across populations is the evolutionary response to viral mutation. However, the molecular basis underpinning the interplay between HLA polymorphism, the T cell repertoire, and viral escape is unclear. Here we investigate the T cell response to a HLA-B*35:01- and HLA-B*35:08-restricted 407HPVGEADYFEY417 epitope from Epstein-Barr virus and naturally occurring variants at positions 4 and 5 thereof. Each viral variant differently impacted on the epitope's flexibility and conformation when bound to HLA-B*35:08 or HLA-B*35:01. We provide a molecular basis for understanding how the single residue polymorphism that discriminates between HLA-B*35:01/08 profoundly impacts on T cell receptor recognition. Surprisingly, one viral variant (P5-Glu to P5-Asp) effectively changed restriction preference from HLA-B*35:01 to HLA-B*35:08. Collectively, our study portrays the interplay between the T cell response, viral escape, and HLA polymorphism, whereby HLA polymorphism enables altered presentation of epitopes from different strains of Epstein-Barr virus.",Immunology;Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC);Structural Biology;T Cell Receptor (TCR);X-ray Crystallography

However, recent findings in experimental animals appear controversial. Here we report that there are significant species differences in CB2R mRNA splicing and expression, protein sequences, and receptor responses to CB2R ligands in mice and rats. Systemic administration of JWH133, a highly selective CB2R agonist, significantly and dose-dependently inhibited intravenous cocaine self-administration under a fixed ratio (FR) schedule of reinforcement in mice, but not in rats. However, under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement, JWH133 significantly increased breakpoint for cocaine self-administration in rats, but decreased it in mice. To explore the possible reasons for these conflicting findings, we examined CB2R gene expression and receptor structure in the brain. We found novel rat-specific CB2C and CB2D mRNA isoforms in addition to CB2A and CB2B mRNA isoforms. In situ hybridization RNAscope assays found higher levels of CB2R mRNA in different brain regions and cell types in mice than in rats. By comparing CB2R-encoding regions, we observed a premature stop codon in the mouse CB2R gene that truncated 13 amino-acid residues including a functional autophosphorylation site in the intracellular C-terminus. These findings suggest that species differences in the splicing and expression of CB2R genes and receptor structures may in part explain the different effects of CB2R-selective ligands on cocaine self-administration in mice and rats.",

This suggests that there could be a specific major depression subtype, inflammatory cytokine-associated depression (ICAD), which may require different therapeutic approaches. However, most people do not develop depression, even when exposed to sustained elevations in inflammatory cytokines. Thus several vulnerabilities and sources of resilience to inflammation-associated depression have been identified.

The switchable process and its reversibility were assessed by repeatedly switching between positive and negative surface potentials. Monolayers of single component biotin-KKKKC SAMs exhibited no conformational change upon the application of an electrical potential, indicating that due to the high level of packing the oligolysine chains are constrained to one extended conformation (anisotropic molecular ordering). On the contrary, when a negative potential of –0.4 V is applied to the mixed biotin-KKKKC:TEGT SAM, a change in conformation occurs owing to the presence of the spacer, TEGT, presumably allowing the folding of the oligolysine backbones (isotropic molecular ordering). Furthermore, the reverse phase of the SFG signal in the region between 3200–3300 cm−1 at –0.4 V suggest that the biotin end-group is facing in the opposite direction compared to the initial measurement (+0.3 V).

This layer of regulatory control over transcriptional networks is preserved by selection across deep evolutionary time, yet selection pressures on individual miRNA genes in contemporary populations remain poorly characterized in any organism. Here, we quantify nucleotide variability for 129 miRNAs in the genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei to understand the microevolution of this important class of regulatory genes. Our analysis of three population samples and C. remanei’s sister species revealed ongoing natural selection that constrains evolution of all sequence domains within miRNA hairpins. We also show that new miRNAs evolve faster than older miRNAs but that selection nevertheless favors their persistence. Despite the ongoing importance of purging of new mutations, we discover a trove of >400 natural miRNA sequence variants that include single nucleotide polymorphisms in seed motifs, indels that ablate miRNA functional domains, and origination of new miRNAs by duplication. Moreover, we demonstrate substantial nucleotide divergence of pre-miRNA hairpin alleles between populations and sister species. These findings from the first global survey of miRNA microevolution in Caenorhabditis support the idea that changes in gene expression, mediated through divergence in miRNA regulation, can contribute to phenotypic novelty and adaptation to specific environments in the present day as well as the distant past.",miRNA;Caenorhabditis;gene expression;regulatory networks;nucleotide variation

We discovered in male FVB/N mice that mild (∼50%) transgenic overexpression of Mecp2 enhances aggression. Surprisingly, when the same transgene was expressed in C57BL/6N mice, transgenics showed reduced aggression and social interaction. This suggests that Mecp2 modulates aggressive social behavior. To test this hypothesis in humans, we performed a phenotype-based genetic association study (PGAS) in >1000 schizophrenic individuals. We found MECP2 SNPs rs2239464 (G/A) and rs2734647 (C/T; 3′UTR) associated with aggression, with the G and C carriers, respectively, being more aggressive. This finding was replicated in an independent schizophrenia cohort. Allele-specific MECP2mRNA expression differs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by ∼50% (rs2734647: C > T). Notably, the brain-expressed, species-conserved miR-511 binds to MECP2 3′UTR only in T carriers, thereby suppressing gene expression. To conclude, subtle MECP2/Mecp2 expression alterations impact aggression. While the mouse data provides evidence of an interaction between genetic background and mild Mecp2 overexpression, the human data convey means by which genetic variation affects MECP2 expression and behavior.",genetic background;human;microRNA;mouse;phenotype-based genetic association study

The aim of this study is to evaluate expression frequency of PAGE4, SCP-1, and SPANXA/D cancer testis antigen (CTA) genes as well as some clinical risk markers to predict liver metastasis of colorectal cancer patients. The expression frequency of PAGE4, SCP-1, and SPANXA/D cancer/testis antigen (CTA) genes was obtained using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay in 90 colorectal tumor samples including both negative and positive liver metastasis tumors. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the association of three studied genes and clinical risk factors with CRC liver metastasis. The frequency of PAGE4 and SCP-1 genes expression was significantly higher in the primary tumours with liver metastasis when statistically compared with primary tumors with no liver metastasis (P < 0.05). Among all clinical risk factors studied, the lymph node metastasis and the depth of invasion were statistically correlated with liver metastasis of CRC patients. In addition, using multiple logistic regression, we constructed a model based on PAGE4 and lymph node metastasis to predict liver metastasis of CRC.",

These observations suggest that the capacity to mount antibody responses to the 2F5 epitope is mitigated by tolerance, but such capacity may be latent in the pre-tolerance and/or anergic B cell pools. Here, we use B cell tetramer reagents to track the frequencies of B cells that recognize the HIV-1 2F5 epitope (SP62): in BL/6 mice, SP62-binding transitional B cells that bind this epitope are readily identified in bone marrow but are lost during subsequent development. Unsurprisingly then, immunization with SP62 immunogen does not elicit significant humoral responses in normal BL/6 mice. Reconstitution of Rag1null mice with normal congenic B cells that have matured in vitro, restores the capacity to mount significant serum Ab and germinal center responses to this HIV-1 epitope. These B cell cultures are permissive for the development of autoreactive B cells and support the development of SP62-specific B cell compartments normally lost in 2F5 antibody knockin mice. The recovery of humoral responses to the 2F5/SP62 epitope of HIV-1 by reconstitution with B cells containing forbidden, autoreactive clones provides direct evidence that normal BL/6 mice latently possess the capacity to generate humoral responses to a conserved, neutralizing HIV-1 epitope.",

summary, a carrier protein strategy was effectively applied
for the X-ray crystal structure determination of an intriguing site-selective
catalyst that is effective for the modification of a teicoplanin A2-2 derivative. Crystallographic analysis revealed a complex
between the catalytically competent peptide sequence and teicoplanin
itself that proved to be quite consistent with the original hypothesis
that led to its study. A catalytic peptide–T4L conjugate based
on the “left/green-selective catalyst” was prepared
using expressed protein ligation. The resulting X-ray crystal structure
reveals that the N-methylimidazole moiety, which
serves to transfer the phosphoryl group in the O–P bond-forming
reaction, is in closer proximity to the N-acetylglucosamine
than the other sugar units, consistent with the observed selectivity
in the phosphorylation event of our prior studies. While consideration
of transition state structures based on analysis of intrinsically
ground-state crystallographic complexes must always be exercised with
caution,43 structural insight obtained
from this catalyst scaffold is expected to serve as a platform for
the design of novel catalysts capable of selectively derivatizing
glycopeptide antibiotics. Furthermore, we speculate that the use of
a carrier protein strategy could be a broadly useful tool to obtain
structural information in the field of asymmetric catalysis in situations
where information on catalyst–substrate complexes are difficult
to obtain otherwise.",

The serum cell killing factor was shown to be an enzyme with l-asparaginase (ASNase) activity. As a direct result of this observation, several bacterial l-asparaginases were developed and are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of the subset of hematological malignancies that are dependent on the extracellular pool of the amino acid asparagine. As drugs, these enzymes act to hydrolyze asparagine to aspartate, thereby starving the cancer cells of this amino acid. Prior to the work presented here, the precise identity of this guinea pig enzyme has not been reported in the peer-reviewed literature. We discovered that the guinea pig enzyme annotated as H0W0T5_CAVPO, which we refer to as gpASNase1, has the required low Km property consistent with that possessed by the cell-killing guinea pig serum enzyme. Elucidation of the ligand-free and aspartate complex gpASNase1 crystal structures allows a direct comparison with the bacterial enzymes and serves to explain the lack of l-glutaminase activity in the guinea pig enzyme. The structures were also used to generate a homology model for the human homolog hASNase1 and to help explain its vastly different kinetic properties compared with gpASNase1, despite a 70% sequence identity. Given that the bacterial enzymes frequently present immunogenic and other toxic side effects, this work suggests that gpASNase1 could be a promising alternative to these bacterial enzymes.",Anticancer Drug;Cancer;Cancer Therapy;Crystallography;Enzyme Kinetics;Asparaginase

Its role in adult hematopoiesis has not been described. We now show that conditional deletion of ZBP-89 in adult mouse hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) causes anemia and thrombocytopenia that are transient in the steady state, but readily uncovered following chemically induced erythro/megakaryopoietic stress. Unexpectedly, stress induced by bone marrow transplantation of ZBP89−/− HSPC also resulted in a myeloid-to-B lymphoid lineage switch in bone marrow recipients. The erythroid and myeloid/B lymphoid lineage anomalies in ZBP89−/− HSPC are reproduced in vitro in the ZBP-89-silenced multipotent hematopoietic cell line FDCP-Mix A4, and are associated with the upregulation of PU.1 and downregulation of SCL/Tal1 and GATA-1 in ZBP89-deficient cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays show that ZBP-89 is a direct repressor of PU.1 and activator of SCL/Tal1 and GATA-1.
