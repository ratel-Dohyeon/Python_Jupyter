Numerous IDPs have close relationships with human diseases such as tumor, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, diabetes, and so on. These disease-associated IDPs commonly play principal roles in the disease-associated protein-protein interaction networks. Most of them in the disease datasets have more interactants and hence the size of the disease-associated IDPs interaction network is simultaneously increased. For example, the tumor suppressor protein p53 is an intrinsically disordered protein and also a hub protein in the p53 interaction network; α-synuclein, an intrinsically disordered protein involved in Parkinson diseases, is also a hub of the protein network. The disease-associated IDPs may provide potential targets for drugs modulating protein-protein interaction networks. Therefore, novel strategies for drug discovery based on IDPs are in the ascendant. It is dependent on the features of IDPs to develop the novel strategies. It is found out that IDPs have unique structural features such as high flexibility and random coil-like conformations which enable them to participate in both the “one to many” and “many to one” interaction. Accordingly, in order to promote novel strategies for drug discovery, it is essential that more and more features of IDPs are revealed by experimental and computing methods.",intrinsically disordered proteins;sequence characterizations;structural characterizations;interaction networks;drug-discovery

Up to now, studies on anchor residues have been focused mainly on ordered proteins. In this study, we investigated anchor residues in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) which are flexible in the free state. We identified the anchor residues of the N-terminus of the p53 protein (Glu17–Asn29, abbreviated as p53N) which are involved in binding with two different targets (MDM2 and Taz2), and analyzed their side chain conformations in the unbound states. The anchor residues in the unbound p53N were found to frequently sample conformations similar to those observed in the bound complexes (i.e., Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26 in the p53N-MDM2 complex, and Leu22 in the p53N-Taz2 complex). We argue that the bound-like conformations of the anchor residues in the unbound state are important for controlling the specific interactions between IDPs and their targets. Further, we propose a mechanism to account for the binding promiscuity of IDPs in terms of anchor residues and molecular recognition features (MoRFs).",anchor residue;intrinsically disordered proteins;binding promiscuity;molecular recognition features;p53;MDM2;Taz2

Here, we discuss the question of proteolytic sensitivity of IDPs, with a view to better explaining their in vivo characteristics. After an initial assessment of the status of IDPs in vivo, we briefly survey the intracellular proteolytic systems. Subsequently, we discuss the evidence for IDPs being inherently sensitive to proteolysis. Such sensitivity would not, however, result in enhanced degradation if the protease-sensitive sites were sequestered. Accordingly, IDP access to and degradation by the proteasome, the major proteolytic complex within eukaryotic cells, are discussed in detail. The emerging picture appears to be that IDPs are inherently sensitive to proteasomal degradation along the lines of the “degradation by default” model. However, available data sets of intracellular protein half-lives suggest that intrinsic disorder does not imply a significantly shorter half-life. We assess the power of available systemic half-life measurements, but also discuss possible mechanisms that could protect IDPs from intracellular degradation. Finally, we discuss the relevance of the proteolytic sensitivity of IDPs to their function and evolution.",intrinsically disordered proteins;IDPs;intrinsically unstructured proteins;IUPs;proteolytic sensitivity;protein half-lives;evolution

Although overexpression of CTAs is frequently associated with advanced disease and poorer prognosis, the significance of this correlation is unclear since the functions of the CTAs in the disease process remain poorly understood. Here, employing a bioinformatics approach, we show that a majority of CTAs are intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). IDPs are proteins that, under physiological conditions in vitro, lack rigid 3D structures either along their entire length or in localized regions. Despite the lack of structure, most IDPs can transition from disorder to order upon binding to biological targets and often promote highly promiscuous interactions. IDPs play important roles in transcriptional regulation and signaling via regulatory protein networks and are often associated with dosage sensitivity. Consistent with these observations, we find that several CTAs can bind DNA, and their forced expression appears to increase cell growth implying a potential dosage-sensitive function. Furthermore, the CTAs appear to occupy ‘hub’ positions in protein regulatory networks that typically adopt a ‘scale-free’ power law distribution. Taken together, our data provide a novel perspective on the CTAs implicating them in processing and transducing information in altered physiological states in a dosage-sensitive manner. Identifying the CTAs that occupy hub positions in protein regulatory networks would allow a better understanding of their functions as well as the development of novel therapeutics to treat cancer.",Cancer/Testis Antigens;Intrinsically Disordered Proteins;Dosage Sensitivity;Cancer

The purpose of this study is to disentangle their correlations. We assess the strength of each indicator by controlling for the other indicators under study. We find that the number of microRNA (miRNA) types that regulate a gene is the strongest rate indicator (a negative correlation), followed by disorder content (the percentage of disordered regions in a protein, a positive correlation); the strength of disorder content as a rate indicator is substantially increased after controlling for the number of miRNA types. By dividing proteins into lowly and highly intrinsically disordered proteins (L-IDPs and H-IDPs), we find that proteins interacting with more H-IDPs tend to evolve more slowly, which largely explains the previous observation of a negative correlation between the number of protein–protein interactions and evolutionary rate. Moreover, all of the indicators examined here, except for the number of miRNA types, have different strengths in L-IDPs and in H-IDPs. Finally, the number of phosphorylation sites is weakly correlated with the number of miRNA types, and its strength as a rate indicator is substantially reduced when other indicators are considered.

Many of these proteins represent cell receptors that function by recognizing their cognate ligand outside the cell and translating this binding information into an intracellular activation signal. Based on location of recognition and signaling (effector) domains, functionally diverse and unrelated cell receptors can be classified into two main families: those in which binding and signaling domains are located on the same protein chain, the so-called single-chain receptors (SRs), and those in which these domains are intriguingly located on separate subunits, the so-called multichain receptors (MRs). Recognition domains of both SRs and MRs are known to be well ordered. In contrast, while cytoplasmic signaling domains of SRs are well-structured as well, those of MRs are intrinsically disordered. Despite important role of receptor signaling in health and disease, extensive comparative structural analysis of receptor signaling domains has not been carried out as of yet. In this study, using a variety of prediction algorithms, we show that protein disorder is a characteristic and distinctive feature of receptors with recognition and signaling functions distributed between separate protein chains. We also reveal that disorder distribution patterns are rather similar within SR subclasses suggesting potential functional explanations.

A major unresolved question is the extent of functional specificity, or redundancy, between the various members of the HMGN protein family. Here, we analyze the transcriptional profile of cells in which the expression of various HMGN proteins has been either deleted or doubled. We find that both up- and downregulation of HMGN expression altered the cellular transcription profile. Most, but not all of the changes were variant specific, suggesting limited redundancy in transcriptional regulation. Analysis of point and swap HMGN mutants revealed that the transcriptional specificity is determined by a unique combination of a functional nucleosome-binding domain and C-terminal domain. Doubling the amount of HMGN had a significantly larger effect on the transcription profile than total deletion, suggesting that the intrinsically disordered structure of HMGN proteins plays an important role in their function. The results reveal an HMGN-variant-specific effect on the fidelity of the cellular transcription profile, indicating that functionally the various HMGN subtypes are not fully redundant.",

Intrinsically Disordered Proteins: Guest Editor M Madan Babu.","The broad family of LEA proteins are intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) with several potential roles in desiccation tolerance, or anhydrobiosis, one of which is to limit desiccation-induced aggregation of cellular proteins. We show here that this activity, termed molecular shield function, is distinct from that of a classical molecular chaperone, such as HSP70 – while HSP70 reduces aggregation of citrate synthase (CS) on heating, two LEA proteins, a nematode group 3 protein, AavLEA1, and a plant group 1 protein, Em, do not; conversely, the LEA proteins reduce CS aggregation on desiccation, while HSP70 lacks this ability. There are also differences in interaction with client proteins – HSP70 can be co-immunoprecipitated with a polyglutamine-containing client, consistent with tight complex formation, whereas the LEA proteins can not, although a loose interaction is observed by Förster resonance energy transfer. In a further exploration of molecular shield function, we demonstrate that synthetic polysaccharides, like LEA proteins, are able to reduce desiccation-induced aggregation of a water-soluble proteome, consistent with a steric interference model of anti-aggregation activity. If molecular shields operate by reducing intermolecular cohesion rates, they should not protect against intramolecular protein damage. This was tested using the monomeric red fluorescent protein, mCherry, which does not undergo aggregation on drying, but the absorbance and emission spectra of its intrinsic fluorophore are dramatically reduced, indicative of intramolecular conformational changes. As expected, these changes are not prevented by AavLEA1, except for a slight protection at high molar ratios, and an AavLEA1-mCherry fusion protein is damaged to the same extent as mCherry alone. A recent hypothesis proposed that proteomes from desiccation-tolerant species contain a higher degree of disorder than intolerant examples, and that this might provide greater intrinsic stability, but a bioinformatics survey does not support this, since there are no significant differences in the degree of disorder between desiccation tolerant and intolerant species. It seems clear therefore that molecular shield function is largely an intermolecular activity implemented by specialist IDPs, distinct from molecular chaperones, but with a role in proteostasis.",

Due to their limited chemical shift dispersion, IDPs often require four pairs of resonance connectivities (Hα, Cα, Cβ and CO) for establishing sequential backbone assignment. Because most conventional 4-D triple-resonance experiments share an overlapping Cα evolution period, combining existing 4-D experiments does not offer an optimal solution for non-redundant collection of a complete set of backbone resonances. Using alternative chemical shift evolution schemes, we propose a new pair of 4-D triple resonance experiments—HA(CA)CO(CA)NH/HA(CA)CONH—that complement the 4-D HNCACB/HN(CO)CACB experiments to provide complete backbone resonance information. Collection of high-resolution 4-D spectra with sparse sampling and FFT-CLEAN processing enables efficient acquisition and assignment of complete backbone resonances of IDPs. Importantly, because the CLEAN procedure iteratively identifies resonance signals and removes their associating aliasing artifacts, it greatly reduces the dependence of the reconstruction quality on sampling schemes and produces high-quality spectra even with less-than-optimal sampling schemes.",Fast NMR;Sparse Sampling;Sequential Assignment;FFT-CLEAN;IDP

As we begin to explore the repertoire of possible protein sequences inherent in the human and other genomes, two stark facts that belie this supposition become clear: firstly, the number of apparent open reading frames in the human genome is significantly smaller than appears to be necessary to code for all of the diverse proteins in higher organisms, and secondly that a significant proportion of the protein sequences that would be coded by the genome would not be expected to form stable three-dimensional structures. Clearly the genome must include coding for a multitude of alternative forms of proteins, some of which may be partly or fully disordered or incompletely structured in their functional states. At the same time as this likelihood was recognized, experimental studies also began to uncover examples of important protein molecules and domains that were incompletely structured or completely disordered in solution, yet remained perfectly functional. In the ensuing years, we have seen an explosion of experimental and genome-annotation studies that have mapped the extent of the intrinsic disorder phenomenon and explored the possible biological rationales for its widespread occurrence. Answers to the question “why would a particular domain need to be unstructured?” are as varied as the systems where such domains are found. This review provides a survey of recent new directions in this field, and includes an evaluation of the role not only of intrinsically disordered proteins but of partially structured and highly dynamic members of the disorder-order continuum.",

To characterize diverse structural ensembles of IDPs, combinations of NMR and computational modeling showed some promise, but they need further improvements. Here, for accurate and efficient modeling of IDPs, we propose a systematic multiscale computational method. We first perform all-atom replica-exchange molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a few fragments selected from a target IDP. These results together with generic knowledge-based local potentials are fed into the iterative Boltzmann inversion method to obtain an accurate coarse-grained potential. Then coarse-grained MD simulations provide the IDP ensemble. We tested the new method for the disordered N-terminal domain of p53 showing that the method reproduced the residual dipolar coupling and x-ray scattering profile very accurately. Further local structure analyses revealed that, guided by all-atom MD ensemble of fragments, the p53 N-terminal domain ensemble was biased to kinked structures in the AD1 region and biased to extended conformers in a proline-rich region and these biases contributed to improvement of the reproduction of the experiments.",

Based upon this, we introduce a simple measure, the relative solvent accessible surface area, which can be used to predict the magnitude of binding-induced conformational changes from the structures of either monomeric proteins or bound subunits. Applying this to a large set of protein complexes suggests that large conformational changes upon binding are common. In addition, we observe considerable enrichment of intrinsically disordered sequences in proteins predicted to undergo large conformational changes. Finally, we demonstrate that the relative solvent accessible surface area of monomeric proteins can be used as a simple proxy for protein flexibility. This reveals a powerful connection between the flexibility of unbound proteins and their binding-induced conformational changes, consistent with the conformational selection model of molecular recognition.",

However, under specific conditions, i.e. the completely disordered state in guanidine hydrochloride, this molecular chaperone forms amyloid fibrils similar to those observed in various neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, this is a good model system to understand the amyloid fibril formation mechanism of intrinsically disordered proteins. Here, we identified a critical intermediate of GroES in the early stages of this fibril formation using NMR and mass spectroscopy measurements. A covalent rearrangement of the polypeptide bond at Asn45-Gly46 and/or Asn51-Gly52 that eventually yield β-aspartic acids via deamidation of asparagine was observed to precede fibril formation. Mutation of these asparagines to alanines resulted in delayed nucleus formation. Our results indicate that peptide bond rearrangement at Asn-Gly enhances the formation of GroES amyloid fibrils. The finding provides a novel insight into the structural process of amyloid fibril formation from a disordered state, which may be applicable to intrinsically disordered proteins in general.",Amyloid;Chaperone Chaperonin;NMR;Protein Conformation;Protein Folding;Asn-Gly Rearrangement;Intrinsically Disordered Protein

This model has several attractive features: as the nascent protein chain emerges from the ribosome, the SNTD folds spontaneously and then serves as a nucleation point for the yet unstructured amino acid chain, creating more compact shapes. This reduces the risk of protein degradation or aggregation. Moreover, an interspersed pattern of SNTD-docked regions and free loops can coordinate assembly of sub-complexes in defined loop-sections and enables novel regulatory mechanisms, for example through posttranslational modifications of docked regions.",

This trait is exhibited by so-called RTX (repeat-in-toxin) motifs found in many virulence factors secreted by numerous Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria: RTX proteins are natively disordered in the absence of calcium but fold upon calcium binding. The adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA) produced by Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough, contains ∼40 RTX motifs organized in five successive blocks separated by non-RTX flanking regions. This RTX domain mediates toxin binding to its eukaryotic cell receptor. We previously showed that the last block of the RTX domain, block V, which is critical for CyaA toxicity, exhibits the hallmarks of intrinsically disordered proteins in the absence of calcium. Moreover, the C-terminal flanking region of CyaA block V is required for its calcium-induced folding. Here, we describe a comprehensive analysis of the hydrodynamic and electrophoretic properties of several block V RTX polypeptides that differ in the presence and/or length of the flanking regions. Our results indicate that the length of the C-terminal flanking region not only controls the calcium-induced folding but also the calcium-induced multimerization of the RTX polypeptides. Moreover, we showed that calcium binding is accompanied by a strong reduction of the net charge of the RTX polypeptides. These data indicate that the disorder-to-order transition in RTX proteins is controlled by a calcium-induced change of the polypeptide charges and stabilized by multimerization.",Adenylate Cyclase;Bacterial Toxins;Biophysics;Calcium-binding Proteins;Spectroscopy;Repeat in Toxin (RTX);Calcium-induced Protein Folding;Intrinsically Disordered Proteins;Multimerization;Protein Charge

In this work, we used bovine κ-casein, which serves as an archetypal model protein for amyloidogenic IDPs. Using a variety of biophysical tools involving both prediction and spectroscopic techniques, we first established that monomeric κ-casein adopts a collapsed premolten-globule-like conformational ensemble under physiological conditions. Our time-resolved fluorescence and light-scattering data indicate a change in the mean hydrodynamic radius from ∼4.6 nm to ∼1.9 nm upon chain collapse. We then took the advantage of two cysteines separated by 77 amino-acid residues and covalently labeled them using thiol-reactive pyrene maleimide. This dual-labeled protein demonstrated a strong excimer formation upon renaturation from urea- and acid-denatured states under both equilibrium and kinetic conditions, providing compelling evidence of polypeptide chain collapse under physiological conditions. The implication of the IDP chain collapse in protein aggregation and amyloid formation is also discussed.",

During synthesis, the nascent polypeptide begins to fold as it traverses the large subunit of the ribosome and is assisted by molecular chaperones in attaining its precise folded/highly ordered state efficiently and in a biologically relevant timescale. Proteins that are misfolded are culled, re-routed, and marked by mechanisms such as ubiquitinylation for degradation ensuring strict quality control (QC). In addition to the highly ordered “globular” proteins, emerging evidence indicates that a large fraction of the proteome also comprises the so-called “Intrinsically Disordered Proteins” (IDPs). IDPs are proteins that lack rigid 3D structures and instead, exist as dynamic ensembles. The dynamic structures in the IDPs have many similarities with “normal” globular proteins such as the native (ordered), and non-native (molten globule, pre-molten globule, and coil-like) states seen during folding of “normal” globular proteins. However, unlike the case of the nascent globular proteins, IDPs evade being detected as “misfolded” and degraded by the cell’s QC system. We refer to this paradox as the order/disorder paradox and postulate that the IDPs capitalize on their intrinsic promiscuity and ability to undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon binding to biological targets (coupled folding and binding) to escape the cell’s surveillance machinery. Understanding the mechanism by which the IDPs evade the quality check has wide implications from protein folding to disease biology since the aggregation of misfolded proteins underlies several debilitating illnesses such as many neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.",PROTEIN FOLDING;ORDER/DISORDER PARADOX;PROTEASOME;CANCER/TESTIS ANTIGENS;CANCER

Little experimental information is, however, available about the side chain conformations and how structure in the backbone affects the side chains. Methyl chemical shifts can in principle report the conformations of aliphatic side chains in disordered proteins and in order to examine this two model systems were chosen: the acid denatured state of acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP) and the intrinsically disordered activation domain of the activator for thyroid hormone and retinoid receptors (ACTR). We find that small differences in the methyl carbon chemical shifts due to the γ-gauche effect may provide information about the side chain rotamer distributions. However, the effects of neighboring residues on the methyl group chemical shifts obscure the direct observation of γ-gauche effect. To overcome this, we reference the chemical shifts to those in a more disordered state resulting in residue specific random coil chemical shifts. The 13C secondary chemical shifts of the methyl groups of valine, leucine, and isoleucine show sequence specific effects, which allow a quantitative analysis of the ensemble of χ2-angles of especially leucine residues in disordered proteins. The changes in the rotamer distributions upon denaturation correlate to the changes upon helix induction by the co-solvent trifluoroethanol, suggesting that the side chain conformers are directly or indirectly related to formation of transient α-helices.",aliphatic side chains;natively unfolded proteins;intrinsically disordered proteins;conformational ensemble;denatured state;hydrophobic packing

In some cases these proteins can bind multiple partners, which can lead to distinct structures and promiscuity in functions. In other words, the capacity to recognize molecular patterns on the substrate is often essential for the folding and function of intrinsically disordered proteins. Biomolecular pattern recognition is extremely relevant both in vivo (e.g., for oligomerization, immune response, induced folding, substrate binding, and molecular switches) and in vitro (e.g., for biosensing, catalysis, chromatography, and implantation). Here, we use a minimalist computational model system to investigate how polar/nonpolar patterns on a surface can induce the folding of an otherwise unstructured peptide. We show that a model peptide that exists in the bulk as a molten globular state consisting of many interconverting structures can fold into either a helix-coil-helix or an extended helix structure in the presence of a complementary designed patterned surface at low hydrophobicity (3.7%) or a uniform surface at high hydrophobicity (50%). However, we find that a carefully chosen surface pattern can bind to and catalyze the folding of a natively unfolded protein much more readily or effectively than a surface with a noncomplementary or uniform distribution of hydrophobic residues.",

Here we use cell biological, biochemical, and computational techniques to compare Q/N-rich protein variants, replacing Ns with Qs and Qs with Ns. We find that the two residues have strong and opposing effects: N-richness promotes assembly of benign self-templating amyloids; Q-richness promotes formation of toxic non-amyloid conformers.

Although for some of these conditions molecular mechanisms are now better understood, the big picture connecting distinct structural properties and functional repertoire of IDPs to pathogenesis and disease progression is still incomplete. Recent studies suggest that signaling and regulatory roles carried out by IDPs require them to be tightly regulated, and that altered IDP abundance may lead to disease. Here, we propose another link between IDPs and disease that takes into account disease-associated missense mutations located in the intrinsically disordered regions. We argue that such mutations are more prevalent and have larger functional impact than previously thought. In addition, we demonstrate that deleterious amino acid substitutions that cause disorder-to-order transitions are particularly enriched among disease mutations compared to neutral polymorphisms. Finally, we discuss potential differences in functional outcomes between disease mutations in ordered and disordered regions, and challenge the conventional structure-centric view of missense mutations.",

The unfolded, extended conformation of ExsE may expedite efficient secretion through the narrow path of the T3SS secretion channel to activate gene expression in a timely manner. We also found that the structurally flexible ExsE samples through conformations with localized structurally ordered regions. Importantly, these transiently ordered elements are related to the secondary structures involved in binding ExsC based on a prior crystal structure of the ExsCExsE complex. These findings support the notion that preexisting structured elements facilitate binding of intrinsically disordered proteins to their targets.",dynamics of ExsE;the ExsE-ExsC interaction;NMR studies;intrinsically disordered proteins;T3SS substrate

Because any protein can become misfolded, these systems must be able to distinguish abnormal proteins from normal ones, yet be capable of recognizing the wide variety of distinctly shaped misfolded proteins they are likely to encounter. How individual PQC degradation systems accomplish this remains an open question. Here we show that the yeast nuclear PQC ubiquitin ligase San1 directly recognizes its misfolded substrates via intrinsically disordered N- and C-terminal domains. These disordered domains are punctuated with small segments of order and high sequence conservation that serve as substrate-recognition sites San1 uses to target its different substrates. We propose that these substrate-recognition sites, interspersed among flexible, disordered regions, provide San1 an inherent plasticity that allows it to bind its many, differently shaped misfolded substrates.",

Transcription factors for instance can bind to a specific sequence of nucleic acids from a soup of similar, but not identical DNA strands, on a timescale of seconds. This is only possible with the enhanced kinetics provided for by a natively disordered structure, where protein folding and binding are cooperative processes. The secondary structures of many proteins are disordered under physiological conditions. Subsequently, the disordered structures fold into ordered structures only when they bind to their specific targets. Induced folding of the protein has two key biological advantages. First, flexible unstructured domains can result in an intrinsic plasticity that allows them to accommodate targets of various size and shape. And, second, the dynamics of this folding process can result in enhanced binding kinetics. Several groups have hypothesized the acceleration of binding kinetics is due to induced folding where a “fly-casting” effect has been shown to break the diffusion-limited rate of binding.

Hfq proteins of different bacteria comprise an evolutionarily conserved core, whereas the C-terminus is variable in length. Although the structure of the conserved core has been elucidated for several Hfq proteins, no structural information has yet been obtained for the C-terminus. Using bioinformatics, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, synchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD) spectroscopy and small angle X-ray scattering we provide for the first time insights into the conformation and dynamic properties of the C-terminal extension of HfqEc. These studies indicate that the C-termini are flexible and extend laterally away from the hexameric core, displaying in this way features typical of intrinsically disordered proteins that facilitate intermolecular interactions. We identified a minimal, intrinsically disordered region of the C-terminus supporting the interactions with longer RNA fragments. This minimal region together with rest of the C-terminal extension provides a flexible moiety capable of tethering long and structurally diverse RNA molecules. Furthermore, SRCD spectroscopy supported the hypothesis that RNA fragments exceeding a certain length interact with the C-termini of HfqEc.",

The SAXS data were used to estimate both the average radius of gyration and the fractal dimension, a measure of the protein's internal scaling properties, under a variety of solution conditions. In the absence of denaturants, the radius of gyration was 38 ± 3.5 Å and the fractal dimension was 1.76 ± 0.05, slightly larger than the value predicted for a well-solvated polymer with excluded volume (1.7). Neither the radius of gyration nor the fractal dimension changed significantly on the addition of urea, further indicating that the protein is extensively unfolded and well solvated in the absence of denaturant. The addition of NaCl or D2O was found to promote aggregation, but did not appear to affect the properties of the monomeric form. The experimental SAXS profiles were also compared with those predicted by a computational model for a random-coil polypeptide, with an adjustable solvation energy term. The experimental data were well fit to the model with the solvation energy close to zero. These results indicate that the λ N protein is among the more expanded members of the broad class of IDPs, most likely because of its high content of charged residues and a large net charge (+15 at neutral pH). The expanded nature of the conformational ensemble may play a role in facilitating the interactions of the protein with other components of the dynamic transcriptional complex.",unfolded proteins;small-angle X-ray scattering;fractal dimension;scaling exponent;solvation;radius of gyration

However, when the conditions are more close to native, an unfolded protein may collapse to a compact globular structure distinct from the folded state. This transition is akin to the coil-globule transition of homopolymers. Single-molecule FRET experiments have been particularly conducive in revealing the collapsed state under conditions of coexistence with the folded state. The collapse can be even more readily observed in natively unfolded proteins. Time-resolved studies, using FRET and small-angle scattering, have shown that the collapse transition is a very fast event, probably occurring on the sub-microsecond time scale. The forces driving collapse are likely to involve both hydrophobic and backbone interactions. The loss of configurational entropy during collapse makes the unfolded state less stable compared to the folded state, thus facilitating folding.",

As a component of the cell's nucleoskeleton, lamin A plays an important role in the mechanical stabilization of the nuclear envelope and in other nuclear functions. It is largely unknown how the characteristic 50 amino acid deletion affects the conformation of the mostly intrinsically disordered tail domain of lamin A. Here we perform replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations of the tail domain and determine an ensemble of semi-stable structures. Based on these structures we show that the ZMPSTE 24 cleavage site on the precursor form of the lamin A tail domain orients itself in such a way as to facilitate cleavage during the maturation process. We confirm our simulated structures by comparing the thermodynamic properties of the ensemble structures to in vitro stability measurements. Using this combination of techniques, we compare the size, heterogeneity of size, thermodynamic stability of the Ig-fold, as well as the mechanisms of force-induced denaturation. Our data shows that the Δ50 lamin A tail domain is more compact and displays less heterogeneity than the mature lamin A tail domain. Altogether these results suggest that the altered structure and stability of the tail domain can explain changed protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions and may represent an etiology of the disease. Also, this study provides the first molecular structure(s) of the lamin A tail domain, which is confirmed by thermodynamic tests.",Laminopathy;structure;mechanics;protein stability;nuclear mechanics

Since most MRs are immune receptors, they are all commonly referred to as multi-chain immune recognition receptors (MIRRs). Recent studies reveal that, in contrast to well-structured signaling domains of SRs, those of MIRRs represent intrinsically disordered regions, the regions that lack a well-defined three-dimensional structure under physiological conditions. Why did nature separate recognition and signaling functions of MIRRs? Why for MIRRs did nature select to provide highly specific signaling through the chaos of protein disorder? What mechanisms could control this chaos in the process of transmembrane signal transduction to provide the specificity and diversity of the immune response?

However, myriad biological functions are performed by highly dynamic, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). IDPs often fold upon binding their biological targets and frequently exhibit “binding diversity” by targeting multiple ligands. We sought to understand the physical basis of IDP binding diversity and herein report that the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor, p21Cip1, adaptively binds to and inhibits the various Cdk/cyclin complexes that regulate eukaryotic cell division. Based on results from NMR spectroscopy, and biochemical and cellular assays, we show that structural adaptability of a helical sub-domain within p21 termed LH enables two other sub-domains termed D1 and D2 to specifically bind conserved surface features of the cyclin and Cdk subunits, respectively, within otherwise structurally distinct Cdk/cyclin complexes. Adaptive folding upon binding is likely to mediate the diverse biological functions of the thousands of IDPs present in eukaryotes.",

However, a combination of high Ka and high kd would lead to a high association rate constant (ka = Kakd), which poses a problem because there is a limit to which ka can be increased, set by the diffusional approach to form the complex. In this Opinion, I propose that having the signaling protein disordered before binding the target provides a way out of this quandary. The intrinsic disorder of the signaling protein would decrease Ka without sacrificing the specificity of the complex, and thereby would allow kd to be increased to a range appropriate for signaling.",

NFκB-mediated gene activation is robust because levels of free IκBα are kept extremely low by rapid, ubiquitin-independent degradation of newly synthesized IκBα. IκBα has a weakly folded ankyrin repeat 5–6 (AR5–6) region that is critical in establishing its short intracellular half-life. The AR5–6 region of IκBα folds upon binding to NFκB. The NFκB-bound IκBα has a long half-life and requires ubiquitin-targeted degradation. We present single molecule FRET evidence that the native state of IκBα transiently populates an intrinsically disordered state characterized by a more extended structure and fluctuations on the millisecond time scale. Binding to NFκB or introduction of stabilizing mutations in AR 6 suppressed the fluctuations, whereas higher temperature or small amounts of urea increased them.

Here, we address this issue through comparing details of the hydration of wild-type α-synuclein and its A53T mutant by a combination of wide-line NMR, differential scanning calorimetry, and molecular dynamics simulations. All three approaches suggest a hydrate shell compatible with a largely disordered state of both proteins. Its fine details, however, are different, with the mutant displaying a somewhat higher level of hydration, suggesting a bias to more open structures, favorable for protein-protein interactions leading to amyloid formation. These differences disappear in the amyloid state, suggesting basically the same surface topology, irrespective of the initial monomeric state.",

PulS interacts with purified S domain to form a 1:1 complex. Circular dichroism, one-dimensional NMR, and hydrodynamic measurements indicate that the S domain is elongated and intrinsically disordered but gains secondary structure upon binding to PulS. Limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry identified the 28 C-terminal residues of the S domain as a minimal binding site with low nanomolar affinity for PulS in vitro that is sufficient for outer membrane targeting of PulD in vivo. The region upstream of this binding site is not required for targeting or multimerization and does not interact with PulS, but it is required for secretin function in type II secretion. Although other secretin chaperones differ substantially from PulS in sequence and secondary structure, they have all adopted at least superficially similar mechanisms of interaction with their cognate secretins, suggesting that intrinsically disordered regions facilitate rapid interaction between secretins and their chaperones.",Chaperone Chaperonin;Escherichia coli;Intrinsically Disordered Proteins;Membrane Proteins;Secretion;Outer Membrane;Periplasm

The p53 transactivation domain (p53TAD) is an IDP that interacts with multiple protein partners and contains numerous phosphorylation sites. Multiple techniques were used to investigate the equilibrium structural ensemble of p53TAD in its native and chemically unfolded states. The results from these experiments show that the native state of p53TAD has dimensions similar to a classical random coil while the chemically unfolded state is more extended. To investigate the molecular properties responsible for this behavior, a novel algorithm that generates diverse and unbiased structural ensembles of IDPs was developed. This algorithm was used to generate a large pool of plausible p53TAD structures that were reweighted to identify a subset of structures with the best fit to small angle X-ray scattering data. High weight structures in the native state ensemble show features that are localized to protein binding sites and regions with high proline content. The features localized to the protein binding sites are mostly eliminated in the chemically unfolded ensemble; while, the regions with high proline content remain relatively unaffected. Data from NMR experiments support these results, showing that residues from the protein binding sites experience larger environmental changes upon unfolding by urea than regions with high proline content. This behavior is consistent with the urea-induced exposure of nonpolar and aromatic side-chains in the protein binding sites that are partially excluded from solvent in the native state ensemble.",

In order to obtain insights into the properties of this domain beyond the average behavior, we probed the end-to-end distance (RE) of several ∼50-residues long FG-repeat clusters in the context of the whole protein domain. Despite the sequence heterogeneity of these FG-clusters, we detected a reoccurring and consistent compaction from a relaxed coil behavior under denaturing conditions (RE/RE,RC = 0.99 ± 0.15 with RE,RC corresponding to ideal relaxed coil behavior) to a collapsed state under native conditions (RE/RE,RC = 0.79 ± 0.09).

Prostate-associated gene 4 (PAGE4) is a member of the CT-X family of CTAs that in addition to testis, is highly expressed in the fetal prostate, and may also play an important role both in benign and malignant prostate diseases. However, the function of this gene remains poorly understood. Here, we show that PAGE4 is a highly (100%) intrinsically disordered protein (IDP). The primary protein sequence conforms to the features of a typical IDP sequence and the secondary structure prediction algorithm metaPrDOS strongly supported this prediction. Furthermore, SDS-gel electrophoresis and analytical size exclusion chromatography of the recombinant protein revealed an anomalous behavior characteristic of IDPs. UV circular dichroism (CD) and NMR spectroscopy confirmed that PAGE4 is indeed a highly disordered protein. In further bioinformatic analysis, the PredictNLS algorithm uncovered a potential nuclear localization signal, whereas the algorithm DBS-Pred returned a 99.1% probability that PAGE4 is a DNA-binding protein. Consistent with this prediction, biochemical experiments showed that PAGE4 preferentially binds a GC-rich sequence. Silencing PAGE4 expression induced cell death via apoptosis and in mice carrying PCa xenografts, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the PAGE4 mRNA attenuated tumor growth in vivo.

While much of the emphasis in the literature has been on the interactions of disordered proteins with other proteins, disorder is also frequently observed in nucleic acids (particularly RNA) and in the proteins that interact with them. The interactions of disordered proteins with DNA most often manifest as molding of the protein onto the B-form DNA structure, although some well-known instances involve remodeling of the DNA structure that seems to require that the interacting proteins be disordered to various extents in the free state. By contrast, induced fit in RNA-protein interactions has been recognized for many years – the existence and prevalence of this phenomenon provides the clearest possible evidence that RNA and its interactions with proteins must be considered as highly dynamic, and the dynamic nature of RNA and its multiplicity of folded and unfolded states is an integral part of its nature and function.",

The kinase inhibitory domain of p27 contains a cyclin-binding subdomain (D1), a Cdk-binding subdomain (D2), and a linker helix subdomain that connects D1 and D2. Here, we report that, despite extensive sequence conservation between Cdk4/cyclin D1 (hereafter Cdk4/cyclin D) and Cdk2/cyclin A, the thermodynamic details describing how the individual p27 subdomains contribute to equally high affinity binding to these two Cdk/cyclin complexes are strikingly different. Differences in enthalpy/entropy compensation revealed that the D2 subdomain of p27 folds incompletely when binding Cdk4/cyclin D versus Cdk2/cyclin A. Incomplete binding-induced folding exposes tyrosine 88 of p27 for phosphorylation by the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Abl. Importantly, tyrosine phosphorylation (of p27) relieves Cdk inhibition by p27, enabling cell cycle entry. Furthermore, the interaction between a conserved hydrophobic patch on cyclin D and subdomain D1 is much weaker than that with cyclin A; consequently, a construct containing subdomains D1 and LH (p27-D1LH) does not inhibit substrate binding to Cdk4/cyclin D as it does to Cdk2/cyclin A. Our results provide a mechanism by which Cdk4 (within the p27/Cdk4/cyclin D complex) is poised to be activated by extrinsic mitogenic signals that impinge upon p27 at the earliest stage of cell division.

Src kinase phosphorylates the GluN2B CTD, but it is unknown how this affects channel activity. In disordered proteins, phosphorylation can tip the balance between order and disorder. Transitions can occur in both directions, so it is not currently possible to predict the effects of phosphorylation. We used single molecule fluorescence to characterize the effects of Src phosphorylation on GluN2B. Scanning fluorescent labeling sites throughout the domain showed no positional dependence of the energy transfer. Instead, efficiency only scaled with the separation between labeling sites suggestive of a relatively featureless conformational energy landscape. Src phosphorylation led to a general expansion of the polypeptide, which would result in greater exposure of known protein-binding sites and increase the physical separation between contiguous sites.

However, a small but growing number of proteasomal substrates are degraded without a requirement for ubiquitinylation. One such substrate is the pyrimidine biosynthetic enzyme thymidylate synthase (EC 2.1.1.45), which catalyzes the synthesis of TMP and is the sole de novo source of TTP for DNA replication and repair. Previous work showed that intracellular proteolysis of human thymidylate synthase is directed by a degron at the polypeptide's N-terminal end, composed of an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) followed by a highly conserved amphipathic α-helix (hA). In the present report, we show that the hA helix does not function simply as an extension or scaffold for the IDR; rather, it provides a specific structural component that is necessary for degradation. Furthermore, its helical conformation is required for this function. We demonstrate that small domains from heterologous proteins can substitute for the IDR and the hA helix of human thymidylate synthase, indicating that the degradation-promoting function of these regions is not sequence-specific. The results, in general, indicate that cooperation between intrinsically disordered domains and α-helical segments is required for ubiquitin-independent degradation by the proteasome. There appears to be little sequence constraint on the ability of these regions to function as degron constituents. Rather, it is the overall conformation (or lack thereof) that is critical.",Proteasome;Protein Degradation;Protein Stability;Protein Structure;Ubiquitination;Intrinsically Disordered Regions;Human Thymidylate Synthase (hTS);Ubiquitin-independent;Degron

In a previous study, we reported that in henipaviruses, the N-terminal domain of the phosphoprotein and the C-terminal domain of the nucleoprotein (NTAIL) are both intrinsically disordered. Here we show that Henipavirus NTAIL domains are also disordered in the context of full-length nucleoproteins. We also report the cloning, purification, and characterization of the C-terminal X domains (PXD) of Henipavirus phosphoproteins. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we show that NTAIL and PXD form a 1:1 stoichiometric complex that is stable under NaCl concentrations as high as 1 m and has a KD in the μm range. Using far-UV circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance, we show that PXD triggers an increase in the α-helical content of NTAIL. Using fluorescence spectroscopy, we show that PXD has no impact on the chemical environment of a Trp residue introduced at position 527 of the Henipavirus NTAIL domain, thus arguing for the lack of stable contacts between the C termini of NTAIL and PXD. Finally, we present a tentative structural model of the NTAIL-PXD interaction in which a short, order-prone region of NTAIL (α-MoRE; amino acids 473–493) adopts an α-helical conformation and is embedded between helices α2 and α3 of PXD, leading to a relatively small interface dominated by hydrophobic contacts. The present results provide the first detailed experimental characterization of the N-P interaction in henipaviruses and designate the NTAIL-PXD interaction as a valuable target for rational antiviral approaches.",Protein Conformation;Protein Domains;Protein Folding;Protein-Protein Interactions;Viral Protein;Henipavirus;Induced Folding;Intrinsically Disordered Proteins;Nucleoprotein;Phosphoprotein

Harris: ude.sivadcu@sirrahmas ;∗Corresponding author ude.sivadcu@sirrahmas","Cardiac myosin-binding protein-C (cMyBP-C) is a thick-filament-associated protein that performs regulatory and structural roles within cardiac sarcomeres. It is a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily of proteins consisting of eight Ig- and three fibronectin (FNIII)-like domains, along with a unique regulatory sequence referred to as the M-domain, whose structure is unknown. Domains near the C-terminus of cMyBP-C bind tightly to myosin and mediate the association of cMyBP-C with thick (myosin-containing) filaments, whereas N-terminal domains, including the regulatory M-domain, bind reversibly to myosin S2 and/or actin. The ability of MyBP-C to bind to both myosin and actin raises the possibility that cMyBP-C cross-links myosin molecules within the thick filament and/or cross-links myosin and thin (actin-containing) filaments together. In either scenario, cMyBP-C could be under mechanical strain. However, the physical properties of cMyBP-C and its behavior under load are completely unknown. Here, we investigated the mechanical properties of recombinant baculovirus-expressed cMyBP-C using atomic force microscopy to assess the stability of individual cMyBP-C molecules in response to stretch. Force-extension curves showed the presence of long extensible segment(s) that became stretched before the unfolding of individual Ig and FNIII domains, which were evident as sawtooth peaks in force spectra. The forces required to unfold the Ig/FNIII domains at a stretch rate of 500 nm/s increased monotonically from ∼30 to ∼150 pN, suggesting a mechanical hierarchy among the different Ig/FNIII domains. Additional experiments using smaller recombinant proteins showed that the regulatory M-domain lacks significant secondary or tertiary structure and is likely an intrinsically disordered region of cMyBP-C. Together, these data indicate that cMyBP-C exhibits complex mechanical behavior under load and contains multiple domains with distinct mechanical properties.",

Here we review from an ensemble perspective important biological effects of such spontaneous fluctuations on protein allostery, function, and evolution. However, rather than present a thorough literature review on each subject, we focus instead on connecting these phenomena through the ensemble-based experimental, theoretical, and computational investigations from our laboratory over the past decade. Special emphasis is given to insights that run counter to some of the prevailing ideas that have emerged over the past 40 years of structural biology research. For instance, when proteins are viewed as conformational ensembles rather than as single structures, the commonly held notion of an allosteric pathway as an obligate series of individual structural distortions loses its meaning. Instead, allostery can result from energetic linkage between distal sites as one Boltzmann distribution of states transitions to another. Additionally, the emerging principles from this ensemble view of proteins have proven surprisingly useful in describing the role of intrinsic disorder in inter-domain communication, functional adaptation mediated by mutational control of fluctuations, and evolutionary conservation of the energetics of protein stability.",Allostery;Protein functional adaptation;Spontaneous fluctuations;Protein energetics;COREX/BEST algorithm;Protein ensemble;Protein evolution

It is vital between cells in multi-cellular organisms, and within cells. A signaling molecule binds to a receptor protein, and initiates a cascade of dynamic events. Signaling is a multistep pathway, which allows signal amplification: if some of the molecules in a pathway transmit the signal to multiple molecules, the result can be a large number of activated molecules across the cell and multiple reactions. That is how a small number of extracellular signaling molecules can produce a major cellular response. The pathway can relay signals from the extracellular space to the nucleus. How do signals travel efficiently over long-distances across the cell? Here we argue that evolution has utilized three properties: a modular functional organization of the cellular network; sequences in some key regions of proteins, such as linkers or loops, which were pre-encoded by evolution to facilitate signaling among domains; and compact interactions between proteins which is achieved via conformational disorder.",

Here, we reveal the structural mechanisms by which, in their 1:1 stoichiometric complexes with actin, they either inhibit assembly by sequestering actin monomers like Thymosin-β4, or enhance motility by directing polarized filament assembly like Ciboulot βT. We combined mutational, functional or structural analysis by X-ray crystallography, SAXS (small angle X-ray scattering) and NMR on Thymosin-β4, Ciboulot, TetraThymosinβ and the long WH2 domain of WASP-interacting protein. The latter sequesters G-actin with the same molecular mechanisms as Thymosin-β4. Functionally different βT/WH2 domains differ by distinct dynamics of their C-terminal half interactions with G-actin pointed face. These C-terminal interaction dynamics are controlled by the strength of electrostatic interactions with G-actin. At physiological ionic strength, a single salt bridge with actin located next to their central LKKT/V motif induces G-actin sequestration in both isolated long βT and WH2 domains. The results open perspectives for elucidating the functions of βT/WH2 domains in other modular proteins.",actin cytoskeleton;functional versatility;intrinsically disordered proteins;WH2 (Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein Homology domain 2) domains;β-thymosin domains

Solution NMR spectroscopy and a hydrophobic moment analysis of MBP's amino-acid sequence have previously revealed three regions with high propensity to form strongly amphipathic α-helices. These regions, located in the central, N- and C-terminal parts of the protein, have been shown to play a role in the interactions of MBP with cytoskeletal proteins, Src homology 3-domain-containing proteins, Ca2+-activated calmodulin (Ca2+-CaM), and myelin-mimetic membrane bilayers. Here, we have further characterized the structure-function relationship of these three domains. We constructed three recombinant peptides derived from the 18.5-kDa murine MBP: (A22–K56), (S72–S107), and (S133–S159) (which are denoted α1, α2, and α3, respectively). We used a variety of biophysical methods (circular dichroism spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, transmission electron microscopy, fluorimetry, and solution NMR spectroscopy and chemical shift index analysis) to characterize the interactions of these peptides with actin and Ca2+-CaM. Our results show that all three peptides can adopt α-helical structure inherently even in aqueous solution. Both α1- and α3-peptides showed strong binding with Ca2+-CaM, and both adopted an α-helical conformation upon interaction, but the binding of the α3-peptide appeared to be more dynamic. Only the α1-peptide exhibited actin polymerization and bundling activity, and the addition of Ca2+-CaM resulted in depolymerization of actin that had been polymerized by α1. The results of this study proved that there is an N-terminal binding domain in MBP for Ca2+-CaM (in addition to the primary site located in the C-terminus), and that it is sufficient for CaM-induced actin depolymerization. These three domains of MBP represent molecular recognition fragments with multiple roles in both membrane- and protein-association.",

Here, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we show that an isolated peptide corresponding to the 60 first N-terminal residues of VSV P (P60) and encompassing PNTR has overall molecular dimensions and a dynamic behavior characteristic of a disordered protein but transiently populates conformers containing α-helices. The modeling of P60 as a conformational ensemble by the ensemble optimization method using SAXS data correctly reproduces the α-helical content detected by NMR spectroscopy and suggests the coexistence of subensembles of different compactness.

Monomeric porcine amelogenin possesses random coil and residual secondary structures, but it is not known which sequence regions would be conformationally attractive to potential enamel matrix targets such as other amelogenins (self-assembly), other matrix proteins, cell surfaces, or biominerals. To address this further, we investigated recombinant porcine amelogenin (rP172) using “solvent engineering” techniques to simultaneously promote native-like structure and induce amelogenin oligomerization in a manner that allows identification of intermolecular contacts between amelogenin molecules. We discovered that in the presence of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) significant folding transitions and stabilization occurred primarily within the N- and C-termini, while the polyproline Type II central domain was largely resistant to conformational transitions. Seven Pro residues (P2, P127, P130, P139, P154, P157, P162) exhibited conformational response to TFE, and this indicates these Pro residues act as folding enhancers in rP172. The remaining Pro residues resisted TFE perturbations and thus act as conformational stabilizers. We also noted that TFE induced rP172 self-association via the formation of intermolecular contacts involving P4–H6, V19–P33, and E40–T58 regions of the N-terminus. Collectively, these results confirm that the N- and C-termini of amelogenin are conformationally responsive and represent potential interactive sites for amelogenin–target interactions during enamel matrix mineralization. Conversely, the Pro, Gln central domain is resistant to folding and this may have important functional significance for amelogenin.",biomineralization;amelogenin;enamel;folding propensity;nuclear magnetic resonance;intrinsically disordered proteins;calcium phosphate biominerals;dynamic light scattering

In this work we determined the solution structure of the N-terminal portion of the MCM complex from the archaeon Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus (N-mtMCM) in the presence and absence of DNA using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). N-mtMCM is a multimeric protein complex that consists of 12 monomers, each of which contains three distinct domains and two unstructured regions. Using an all-atom approach incorporating modern force field and Monte Carlo methods to allow the unstructured regions of each monomer to be varied independently, we generated an ensemble of biologically relevant structures for the complex. An examination of the subsets of structures that were most consistent with the SANS data revealed that large movements between the three domains of N-mtMCM can occur in solution. Furthermore, changes in the SANS curves upon DNA binding could be correlated to the motion of a particular N-mtMCM domain. These results provide structural support to the previously reported biochemical observations that large domain motions are required for the activation of the MCM helicase in archaea and eukarya. The methods developed here for N-mtMCM solution structure modeling should be suitable for other large protein complexes with unstructured flexible regions.",

The intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of N (NTAIL) is essential for transcription and replication of the virus via interaction with the phosphoprotein P of the viral polymerase complex. The molecular recognition element (MoRE) of NTAIL that binds P is situated 90 amino acids from the folded RNA-binding domain (NCORE) of N, raising questions about the functional role of this disordered chain. Here we report the first in situ structural characterization of NTAIL in the context of the entire N-RNA capsid. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, small angle scattering, and electron microscopy, we demonstrate that NTAIL is highly flexible in intact nucleocapsids and that the MoRE is in transient interaction with NCORE. We present a model in which the first 50 disordered amino acids of NTAIL are conformationally restricted as the chain escapes to the outside of the nucleocapsid via the interstitial space between successive NCORE helical turns. The model provides a structural framework for understanding the role of NTAIL in the initiation of viral transcription and replication, placing the flexible MoRE close to the viral RNA and, thus, positioning the polymerase complex in its functional environment.",NMR;SAXS;ensemble description;dynamics;unfolded protein

While binding to the surface of nucleosomes is directed by an ∼80-amino-acid-residue globular domain, the structure and interactions of the lysine-rich ∼100-residue C-terminal domain (CTD), primarily responsible for the chromatin-condensing functions of linker histones, are poorly understood. By quantitatively analyzing binding of a set of H1 CTD deletion mutants to nucleosomes containing various lengths of linker DNA, we have identified interactions between distinct regions of the CTD and nucleosome linker DNA at least 21 bp from the edge of the nucleosome core. Importantly, partial CTD truncations caused increases in H1 binding affinity, suggesting that significant entropic costs are incurred upon binding due to CTD folding. van't Hoff entropy/enthalpy analysis and intramolecular fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies indicate that the CTD undergoes substantial nucleosome-directed folding, in a manner that is distinct from that which occurs upon H1 binding to naked DNA. In addition to defining critical interactions between the H1 CTD and linker DNA, our data indicate that the H1 CTD is an intrinsically disordered domain and provide important insights into the biological function of this protein.",

Most E3 ligases in ubiquitin-like modifications do not directly participate in chemistry, but are thought to confer allosteric effects; however the nature of the allosteric effects has been elusive. Recent molecular dynamics simulations suggested that an E3 binding enhances the population of the conformational states of E2~SUMO thioester that favor reactions. In this study, we carried out the first temperature-dependent enzyme kinetic analysis to investigate the role of an E3 on activation entropy and enthalpy. The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E3, RanBP2, confers unusually large, favorable activation entropy to lower the activation energy of the reaction. Mutants of RanBP2, designed to alter flexibilities of the E2~SUMO thioester, showed a direct correlation of their favorable entropic effects with their ability to restriction the conformational flexibility of the E2~SUMO thioester. While the more favorable activation entropy is consistent with the previously suggested role of E3 in conformational selection, the large positive entropy suggests a significant role of solvent in catalysis. Indeed, molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water revealed that the more stable E2~SUMO thioester upon E3 binding results in stabilization of a large number of bound water molecules. Liberating such structured water at transition state can result in large favorable activation entropy but unfavorable activation enthalpy. The entropy-driven mechanism of the E3 is consistent with the lack of structural conservation among E3s despite their similar functions. This study also illustrates how proteins that bind both SUMO and E2 can function as E3s and how intrinsically unstructured proteins can enhance macromolecular chemistry in addition to their known advantages in protein-protein interactions.",ubiquitin;SUMO;E3 ligase;allosteric effect;solvent effect;intrinsically disordered proteins

Nonetheless, over the past few decades, numerous examples of proteins exhibiting biological function arising from multiple structural states of varying disorder have been identified. Most recently, several examples of ‘metamorphic proteins’, able to interconvert between vastly different native-like topologies under physiological conditions, have been characterised with multiple functions. In this review, we look at the concept of protein metamorphosis in relation to the current understanding of the protein structure–function landscape. Although structural dynamism observed for metamorphic proteins provides a novel source of functional versatility, the dynamic nature of the metamorphic proteins generally makes them difficult to identify and probe using conventional protein structure determination methods. However, as the existence of metamorphic proteins has now been established and techniques enabling the analysis of multiple protein conformers are improving, it is likely that this class will continue to grow in number.",Metamorphic proteins;Lymphotactin;Mad2;CLIC1

Mutation of Pro27 to serine results in the highest affinity yet observed for MDM2-binding of the p53 peptide. Both UV resonance Raman spectroscopy (UVRR) and simulations reveal that the P27S mutation decreases the extent of PPII helical content and increases the probability for conformations that are similar to the α-helical MDM2-bound conformation. In addition, UVRR measurements were performed on peptides that were isotopically labeled at the Leu26 residue preceding the Pro27 in order to determine the conformational distributions of Leu26 in the wild-type and mutant peptides. The UVRR and simulation results are in quantitative agreement in terms of the change in the population of non-PPII conformations involving Leu26 upon mutation of Pro27 to serine. Finally, our simulations reveal that the MDM2-bound conformation of the peptide is significantly populated in both the wild-type and mutant isolated peptide ensembles in their unbound states, suggesting that MDM2 binding of the p53 peptides may involve conformational selection.",

In the yeast nucleus, misfolded proteins are targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin ligase San1, which binds misfolded nuclear proteins directly and does not appear to require chaperones for substrate binding. San1 is also remarkably adaptable, as it is capable of ubiquitinating a structurally diverse assortment of abnormally folded substrates. We attribute this adaptability to San1's high degree of structural disorder, which provides flexibility and allows San1 to conform to differently shaped substrates.

CCT responds to decreases in membrane phosphatidylcholine content by reversible membrane binding and activation. Two prominent isoforms, CCTα and -β2, have nearly identical catalytic domains and very similar membrane binding amphipathic helical (M) domains but have divergent and structurally disordered N-terminal (N) and C-terminal phosphorylation (P) regions. We found that the binding affinity of purified CCTβ2 for anionic membranes was weaker than CCTα by more than an order of magnitude. Using chimeric CCTs, insertion/deletion mutants, and truncated CCTs, we show that the stronger affinity of CCTα can be attributed in large part to the electrostatic membrane binding function of the polybasic nuclear localization signal (NLS) motif, present in the unstructured N-terminal segment of CCTα but lacking in CCTβ2. The membrane partitioning of CCTβ2 in cells enriched with the lipid activator, oleic acid, was also weaker than that of CCTα and was elevated by incorporation of the NLS motif. Thus, the polybasic NLS can function as a secondary membrane binding motif not only in vitro but in the context of cell membranes. A comparison of phosphorylated, dephosphorylated, and region P-truncated forms showed that the in vitro membrane affinity of CCTβ2 is more sensitive than CCTα to phosphorylation status, which antagonizes membrane binding of both isoforms. These data provide a model wherein the primary membrane binding motif, an amphipathic helical domain, works in collaboration with other intrinsically disordered segments that modulate membrane binding strength. The NLS reinforces, whereas the phosphorylated tail antagonizes the attraction of domain M for anionic membranes.",Phospholipid Metabolism;Phospholipid Vesicle;Protein Folding;Protein Phosphorylation;Ultracentrifugation;Amphipathic Helix;Intrinsically Disordered;Lipid-Protein Interactions;Nuclear Localization Signal;Polybasic Motif

Computational and biophysical analyses showed that both proteins are intrinsically disordered in their large C-terminal domains, which are transcription regulatory domains (TRDs) in many NAC TFs. Using motif searches and interaction studies in yeast we identified an evolutionarily conserved sequence, the LP motif, in the TRD of HvNAC013. This motif was sufficient for transcriptional activity. In contrast, HvNAC005 did not function as a transcriptional activator suggesting that an involvement of HvNAC013 and HvNAC005 in senescence will be different. HvNAC013 interacted with barley radical-induced cell death 1 (RCD1) via the very C-terminal part of its TRD, outside of the region containing the LP motif. No significant secondary structure was induced in the HvNAC013 TRD upon interaction with RCD1. RCD1 also interacted with regions dominated by intrinsic disorder in TFs of the MYB and basic helix-loop-helix families. We propose that RCD1 is a regulatory protein capable of interacting with many different TFs by exploiting their intrinsic disorder. In addition, we present the first structural characterization of NAC C-terminal domains and relate intrinsic disorder and sequence motifs to activity and protein-protein interactions.",Plant;Protein Folding;Protein-Protein Interactions;Transcription Factors;Transcription Regulation;Intrinsic Disorder;Plant Transcription Factor;Senescence;Transcription Factor Interactions;Transcription Regulatory Domain

Moreover, increasing evidence indicates that soluble oligomers are associated with early pathological alterations and that oligomeric assemblies of different disease-associated proteins may share common structural features. Previous studies revealed that toxic effects of the scrapie prion protein (PrPSc), a β-sheet-rich isoform of the cellular PrP (PrPC), are dependent on neuronal expression of PrPC. In this study, we demonstrate that PrPC has a more general effect in mediating neurotoxic signalling by sensitizing cells to toxic effects of various β-sheet-rich (β) conformers of completely different origins, formed by (i) heterologous PrP, (ii) amyloid β-peptide, (iii) yeast prion proteins or (iv) designed β-peptides. Toxic signalling via PrPC requires the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain (N-PrP) and the GPI anchor of PrP. We found that the N-terminal domain is important for mediating the interaction of PrPC with β-conformers. Interestingly, a secreted version of N-PrP associated with β-conformers and antagonized their toxic signalling via PrPC. Moreover, PrPC-mediated toxic signalling could be blocked by an NMDA receptor antagonist or an oligomer-specific antibody. Our study indicates that PrPC can mediate toxic signalling of various β-sheet-rich conformers independent of infectious prion propagation, suggesting a pathophysiological role of the prion protein beyond of prion diseases.",Alzheimer;intrinsically disordered;NMDA receptor;oligomer;prion

Their molecular function in ensuring plant survival is not yet known, but several studies suggest their involvement in membrane stabilization. The dehydrins are characterized by a broad repertoire of conserved and repetitive sequences, out of which the archetypical K-segment has been implicated in membrane binding. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of these K-segments, we examined the interaction between lipid membranes and a dehydrin with a basic functional sequence composition: Lti30, comprising only K-segments. Our results show that Lti30 interacts electrostatically with vesicles of both zwitterionic (phosphatidyl choline) and negatively charged phospholipids (phosphatidyl glycerol, phosphatidyl serine, and phosphatidic acid) with a stronger binding to membranes with high negative surface potential. The membrane interaction lowers the temperature of the main lipid phase transition, consistent with Lti30’s proposed role in cold tolerance. Moreover, the membrane binding promotes the assembly of lipid vesicles into large and easily distinguishable aggregates. Using these aggregates as binding markers, we identify three factors that regulate the lipid interaction of Lti30 in vitro: (1) a pH dependent His on/off switch, (2) phosphorylation by protein kinase C, and (3) reversal of membrane binding by proteolytic digest.",

In eukaryotes, these proteins are implicated in various crucial cellular processes, including translation, membrane trafficking, cell cycle progression, and membrane signaling. As targets of mutation and toxins, GTPases are involved in the pathogenesis of cancer and infectious diseases. In prokaryotes also, it is hard to overestimate the importance of GTPases in cell physiology. Numerous papers have shed new light on the role of bacterial GTPases in cell cycle regulation, ribosome assembly, the stress response, and other cellular processes. Moreover, bacterial GTPases have been identified as high-potential drug targets. A key paper published over 2 decades ago stated that, “It may never again be possible to capture [GTPases] in a family portrait” (H. R. Bourne, D. A. Sanders, and F. McCormick, Nature 348:125-132, 1990) and indeed, the last 20 years have seen a tremendous increase in publications on the subject. Sequence analysis identified 13 bacterial GTPases that are conserved in at least 75% of all bacterial species. We here provide an overview of these 13 protein subfamilies, covering their cellular functions as well as cellular localization and expression levels, three-dimensional structures, biochemical properties, and gene organization. Conserved roles in eukaryotic homologs will be discussed as well. A comprehensive overview summarizing current knowledge on prokaryotic GTPases will aid in further elucidating the function of these important proteins.",

Central to the tumorigenic events in APC mutant cells is the uncontrolled stabilization and transcriptional activation of the protein β-catenin. Many questions remain as to how APC controls β-catenin degradation. Remarkably, the large C-terminal region of APC, which spans over 2000 amino acids and includes critical regions in downregulating β-catenin, is predicted to be natively unfolded. Here we discuss how this uncommonly large disordered region may help to coordinate the multiple cellular functions of APC. Recently, a significant number of germline and somatic missense mutations in the central region of APC were linked to tumorigenesis in the colon as well as extra-intestinal tissues. We classify and localize all currently known missense mutations in the APC structure. The molecular basis by which these mutations interfere with the function of APC remains unresolved. We propose several mechanisms by which cancer-related missense mutations in the large disordered domain of APC may interfere with tumor suppressor activity. Insight in the underlying molecular events will be invaluable in the development of novel strategies to counter dysregulated Wnt signaling by APC mutations in cancer.",

Describing such intrinsic structure is important to understand the transition between free and bound state, leading to supramolecular complexes with physiological interactors. IDP structure is highly dynamic and, therefore, difficult to study by conventional techniques. This work focuses on conformational analysis of the KID fragment of the Sic1 protein, an IDP with a key regulatory role in the cell-cycle of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. FT-IR spectroscopy, ESI-MS, and IM measurements are used to capture dynamic and short-lived conformational states, probing both secondary and tertiary protein structure. The results indicate that the isolated Sic1 KID retains dynamic helical structure and populates collapsed states of different compactness. A metastable, highly compact species is detected. Comparison between the fragment and the full-length protein suggests that chain length is crucial to the stabilization of compact states of this IDP.

Processing and degradation of mRNAs are initiated by an endonucleolytic attack, and the cleavage products are processively degraded by exoribonucleases. In many bacteria, these RNases, as well as RNA helicases and other proteins, are organized in a protein complex called the RNA degradosome. In Escherichia coli, the RNA degradosome is assembled around the essential endoribonuclease E. In Bacillus subtilis, the recently discovered essential endoribonuclease RNase Y is involved in the initiation of RNA degradation. Moreover, RNase Y interacts with other RNases, the RNA helicase CshA, and the glycolytic enzymes enolase and phosphofructokinase in a degradosome-like complex. In this work, we have studied the domain organization of RNase Y and the contribution of the domains to protein-protein interactions. We provide evidence for the physical interaction between RNase Y and the degradosome partners in vivo. We present experimental and bioinformatic data which indicate that the RNase Y contains significant regions of intrinsic disorder and discuss the possible functional implications of this finding. The localization of RNase Y in the membrane is essential both for the viability of B. subtilis and for all interactions that involve RNase Y. The results presented in this study provide novel evidence for the idea that RNase Y is the functional equivalent of RNase E, even though the two enzymes do not share any sequence similarity.",

As Cel knock-out mice do not express the phenotype and the mutant protein has an altered and intrinsically disordered tandem repeat domain, we hypothesized that the disease mechanism might involve a negative effect of the mutant protein. In silico analysis showed that the pI of the tandem repeat was markedly increased from pH 3.3 in wild-type (WT) to 11.8 in mutant (MUT) human CEL. By stably overexpressing CEL-WT and CEL-MUT in HEK293 cells, we found similar glycosylation, ubiquitination, constitutive secretion, and quality control of the two proteins. The CEL-MUT protein demonstrated, however, a high propensity to form aggregates found intracellularly and extracellularly. Different physicochemical properties of the intrinsically disordered tandem repeat domains of WT and MUT proteins may contribute to different short and long range interactions with the globular core domain and other macromolecules, including cell membranes.

Although 3′ end binding by La involves the N-terminal La domain and adjacent RNA recognition motif (RRM), the mechanisms by which La stabilizes diverse RNAs from nucleases and assists subsequent events in their biogenesis are unknown. Here we report that a conserved feature of La proteins, an intrinsically disordered C terminus, is required for the accumulation of certain noncoding RNA precursors and for the role of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae La protein Lhp1p in assisting formation of correctly folded pre-tRNA anticodon stems in vivo. Footprinting experiments using purified Lhp1p reveal that the C terminus is required to protect a pre-tRNA anticodon stem from chemical modification. Although the C terminus of Lhp1p is hypersensitive to proteases in vitro, it becomes protease-resistant upon binding pre-tRNAs, U6 RNA, or pre-5S rRNA. Thus, while high affinity binding to 3′ ends requires the La domain and RRM, a conformationally flexible C terminus allows La to interact productively with a diversity of noncoding RNA precursors. We propose that intrinsically disordered domains adjacent to well characterized RNA-binding motifs in other promiscuous RNA-binding proteins may similarly contribute to the ability of these proteins to influence the cellular fates of multiple distinct RNA targets.",RNA-binding protein;unstructured domain;noncoding RNA biogenesis

The block V repeat-in-toxin motif of the Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase is an example of an IDP that undergoes a transition from a disordered state to an ordered beta roll conformation in the presence of calcium ions. In solution, a C-terminal capping domain is necessary for this transition to occur. To further explore the conformational behavior and folding requirements of this IDP, we have cysteine modified three previously characterized constructs, allowing for attachment to the gold surface of a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). We demonstrate that, while immobilized, the C-terminally capped peptide exhibits similar calcium-binding properties to what have been observed in solution. In addition, immobilization on the solid surface appears to enable calcium-responsiveness in the uncapped peptides, in contrast to the behavior observed in solution. This work demonstrates the power of QCM as a tool to study the conformational changes of IDPs immobilized on surfaces and has implications for a range of potential applications where IDPs may be engineered and used including protein purification, biosensors, and other bionanotechnology applications.",intrinsically disordered peptide;beta roll;quartz crystal microbalance;repeat-in-toxin domain;calcium-responsive peptide

The classic 18.5-kDa MBP isoform has a proline-rich region comprising amino acids 92–99 (murine sequence –T92PRTPPPS99–) that contains a minimal SH3 ligand domain. We have previously shown that 18.5-kDa MBP binds to several SH3 domains, including that of Fyn, a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases involved in a number of signaling pathways during CNS development. To determine the physiological role of this binding as well as the role of phosphorylation of Thr92 and Thr95, in the current study we have produced several MBP variants specifically targeting phosphorylation sites and key structural regions of MBP’s SH3 ligand domain. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we have demonstrated that, compared with the wild-type protein, these variants have lower affinity for the SH3 domain of Fyn. Moreover, overexpression of N-terminal-tagged GFP versions in immortalized oligodendroglial N19 and N20.1 cell cultures results in aberrant elongation of membrane processes and increased branching complexity and inhibits the ability of MBP to decrease Ca2+ influx. Phosphorylation of Thr92 can also cause MBP to traffic to the nucleus, where it may participate in additional protein–protein interactions. Coexpression of MBP with a constitutively active form of Fyn kinase resulted in membrane process elaboration, a phenomenon that was abolished by point amino acid substitutions in MBP’s SH3 ligand domain. These results suggest that MBP’s SH3 ligand domain plays a key role in intracellular protein interactions in vivo and may be required for proper membrane elaboration of developing oligodendrocytes and, further, that phosphorylation of Thr92 and Thr95 can regulate this function.",myelin basic protein (MBP);Fyn;SH3 domain;oligodendrocytes;isothermal titration calorimetry;calcium imaging;myelination

It is activated by the calcium sensor calmodulin. Calmodulin binds to a regulatory domain within calcineurin, causing a conformational change that displaces an autoinhibitory domain from the active site, resulting in activation of the phosphatase. This is the same general mechanism by which calmodulin activates calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. Previously published data has hinted that the regulatory domain of calcineurin is intrinsically disordered. In this work we demonstrate that the regulatory domain is unstructured and that it folds upon binding calmodulin, ousting the autoinhibitory domain from the catalytic site. The regulatory domain is 95 residues long, with the autoinhibitory domain attached to its C-terminal end and the 24 residue calmodulin binding region towards the N-terminal end. This is unlike the calmodulin-dependent protein kinases which have calmodulin binding sites and autoinhibitory domains immediately adjacent in sequence. Our data demonstrate that not only does the calmodulin binding region fold, but that an ~25-30 residue region between it and the autoinhibitory domain also folds, resulting in over half of the regulatory domain adopting α-helical structure. This appears to be the first observation of calmodulin inducing folding of this scale outside of its binding site on a target protein.",

PP1 has been found to be essential in Plasmodium falciparum, but little is known about its regulators. In this study, we have identified a homolog of Inhibitor-3 of PP1, named PfI3. NMR analysis shows that PfI3 belongs to the disordered protein family. High affinity interaction of PfI3 and PfPP1 is demonstrated in vitro using several methods, with an apparent dissociation constant KD of 100 nm. We further show that the conserved 41KVVRW45 motif is crucial for this interaction as the replacement of the Trp45 by an Ala45 severely decreases the binding to PfPP1. Surprisingly, PfI3 was unable to rescue a yeast strain deficient in I3 (Ypi1). This lack of functional orthology was supported as functional assays in vitro have revealed that PfI3, unlike yeast I3 and human I3, increases PfPP1 activity. Reverse genetic approaches suggest an essential role of PfI3 in the growth and/or survival of blood stage parasites because attempts to obtain knock-out parasites were unsuccessful, although the locus of PfI3 is accessible. The main localization of a GFP-tagged PfI3 in the nucleus of all blood stage parasites is compatible with a regulatory role of PfI3 on the activity of nuclear PfPP1.",Infectious Diseases;NMR;Phosphatase;Plasmodium;Recombinant Protein Expression;Inhibitor-3;PP1 Regulator;Protein Phosphatase 1;Protein-Protein Interaction

One of the advantages of intrinsically disordered protein domains is thought to be their ability to take part in multiple, specific but low affinity protein interactions; however, relatively few IRF-1-interacting proteins have been described. The recent identification of a functional binding interface for the E3-ubiquitin ligase CHIP within the major disordered domain of IRF-1 led us to ask whether this region might be employed more widely by regulators of IRF-1 function. Here we describe the use of peptide aptamer-based affinity chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry to define a multiprotein binding interface on IRF-1 (Mf2 domain; amino acids 106–140) and to identify Mf2-binding proteins from A375 cells. Based on their function as known transcriptional regulators, a selection of the Mf2 domain-binding proteins (NPM1, TRIM28, and YB-1) have been validated using in vitro and cell-based assays. Interestingly, although NPM1, TRIM28, and YB-1 all bind to the Mf2 domain, they have differing amino acid specificities, demonstrating the degree of combinatorial diversity and specificity available through linear interaction motifs.",Peptides;Protein Domains;Protein Motifs;Protein-Protein Interactions;Transcription Factors;Tumor Suppressor;IRF-1;Intrinsic Disorder;Linear Interaction Motif;Multiprotein Interface

Nevertheless, we still know little about how proteins fold and unfold in their natural biological habitat: the living cell. Indeed, a variety of cellular components, including molecular chaperones, the ribosome, and crowding of the intracellular medium, modulate folding mechanisms in physiologically relevant environments. This review focuses on the current state of knowledge in protein folding in the cell with emphasis on the early stage of a protein’s life, as the nascent polypeptide traverses and emerges from the ribosomal tunnel. Given the vectorial nature of ribosome-assisted translation, the transient degree of chain elongation becomes a relevant variable expected to affect nascent protein foldability, aggregation propensity and extent of interaction with chaperones and the ribosome.",ribosome;molecular chaperones;ribosomal exit tunnel;nascent protein;molecular crowding;ribosome-bound nascent chain

We previously found that the murine isoform SAA2.2 exists in aqueous solution as a marginally stable hexamer at 4-20°C, but becomes an intrinsically disordered protein at 37°C. Here we show that when urea-denatured SAA2.2 is dialyzed into buffer (pH 8.0, 4°C), it refolds mostly into an octameric species. The octamer transitions to the hexameric structure upon incubation from days to weeks at 4°C, depending on the SAA2.2 concentration. Thermal denaturation of the octamer and hexamer monitored by circular dichroism showed that the octamer is ~10°C less stable, with a denaturation mid point of ~22°C. Thus, SAA2.2 becomes kinetically trapped by refolding into a less stable, but more kinetically accessible octameric species. The ability of SAA2.2 to form different oligomeric species in vitro along with its marginal stability, suggest that the structure of SAA might be modulated in vivo to form different biologically relevant species.",kinetic control;oligomerization;intrinsically disordered;inflammation;folding;SAA

These proteins contain one or two RNA recognition domains (RRMs) and a C-terminal domain rich in Arg-Ser repeats (RS domain). SR proteins are phosphorylated at numerous serines in the RS domain by the SRPK family of protein kinases. RS domain phosphorylation is necessary for entry of SR proteins into the nucleus and may also play important roles in alternative splicing, mRNA export and other processing events. Although SR proteins are polyphosphorylated in vivo, the mechanism underlying this complex reaction has only been recently elucidated. SRSF1, a prototype for the SR protein family, is regiospecifically phosphorylated by SRPK1, a posttranslational modification that controls cytoplasmic-nuclear localization. SRPK1 binds SRSF1 with unusually high affinity and rapidly modifies about 10–12 serines in the N-terminal portion of the RS domain (RS1) using a mechanism that incorporates sequential, C-to-N phosphorylation and several processive steps. SRPK1 employs a highly dynamic feeding mechanism for RS domain phosphorylation in which the N-terminal portion of RS1 is initially bound to a docking groove in the large lobe of the kinase domain. Upon subsequent rounds of phosphorylation, this N-terminal segment translocates into the active site and a β strand in RRM2 unfolds and occupies the docking groove. These studies indicate that efficient regiospecific phosphorylation of SRSF1 is the result of a contoured binding cavity in SRPK1, a lengthy Arg-Ser repetitive segment in the RS domain and a highly directional processing mechanism.",Mechanism;Protein Kinase;Splicing;SR protein;Structure

The identification of EWS-FLI1 protein partners is essential to enhance its vulnerability as a therapeutic target. We utilized phage display library screening against recombinant EWS-FLI1 protein. We identified 27 unique Ewing Sarcoma binding peptides. The cytotoxicity evaluation of these peptides with in EWS-FLI1 containing cell lines yielded one potent peptide called ESAP1 (TMRGKKKRTRAN). ESAP1 binds EWS-FLI1 with 0.202 micromolar affinity as measured in surface plasmon resonance. The minimal interaction region of ESAP1 is characterized and found that the lysine residues are critical for cellular cytotoxicity. ESAP1 reduces the transcriptional activity of EWS-FLI1 as well as disrupts cell cycle kinetics in Ewing tumor cells. These findings provide both a novel experimental probe and a potential therapeutic scaffold for Ewing tumor.,ewing tumors;peptide;EWS-FLI1;transcription factor;cell cycle;ESAP1;intrinsically disordered protein

However, the majority of proteins can fold without the assistance of the known molecular chaperones, and little attention has been paid to the potential chaperoning roles of other macromolecules. During protein biogenesis and folding, newly synthesized polypeptide chains interact with a variety of macromolecules, including ribosomes, RNAs, cytoskeleton, lipid bilayer, proteolytic system, etc. In general, the hydrophobic interactions between molecular chaperones and their substrates have been widely believed to be mainly responsible for the substrate stabilization against aggregation. Emerging evidence now indicates that other features of macromolecules such as their surface charges, probably resulting in electrostatic repulsions, and steric hindrance, could play a key role in the stabilization of their linked proteins against aggregation. Such stabilizing mechanisms are expected to give new insights into our understanding of the chaperoning functions for de novo protein folding.

Davis,"Department of Pharmacology, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48201;*Address correspondence to: Nicholas G. Davis (ude.enyaw.dem@sivadn).","The yeast kinase Yck2 tethers to the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane through dual palmitoylation of its C-terminal Cys-Cys dipeptide, mediated by the Golgi-localized palmitoyl-transferase Akr1. Here, the Yck2 palmitoylation signal is found to consist of three parts: 1) a 10-residue-long, conserved C-terminal peptide (CCTP) that includes the C-terminal Cys-Cys dipeptide; 2) the kinase catalytic domain (KD); and mapping between these two elements; and 3) a 176-residue-long, poorly conserved, glutamine-rich sequence. The CCTP, which contains the C-terminal cysteines as well as an important Phe-Phe dipeptide, likely serves as an Akr1 recognition element, because CCTP mutations disrupt palmitoylation within a purified in vitro palmitoylation system. The KD contribution appears to be complex with roles for both KD activity (e.g., Yck2-mediated phosphorylation) and structure (e.g., Akr1 recognition elements). KD and CCTP mutations are strongly synergistic, suggesting that, like the CCTP, the KD may also participate at the Yck2-Akr1 recognition step. The long, glutamine-rich domain, which is located between the KD and CCTP, is predicted to be intrinsically disordered and may function as a flexible, interdomain linker, allowing a coupled interaction of the KD and CCTP with Akr1. Multipart palmitoylation signals may prove to be a general feature of this large class of palmitoylation substrates. These soluble proteins have no clear means of accessing membranes and thus may require active capture out of the cytoplasm for palmitoylation by their membrane-localized transferases.",

To understand the contributions of the three domains to chromatin condensation, we incorporated various constructs of macroH2A into defined nucleosomal arrays and analyzed their impact on in vitro chromatin compaction. The folding and oligomerization properties of arrays containing full-length macroH2A (macroH2AFL), macroH2A(1–161) (encompassing the histone domain and linker region), and macroH2A(1–122) (histone domain only) were compared with major-type H2A arrays. Analytical ultracentrifugation and atomic force microscope imaging indicate that macroH2A(1–161)-containing arrays favor condensation under conditions where major-type arrays are nearly fully extended. In contrast, arrays with macroH2AFL exhibit behavior similar to that of major-type arrays. This suggests that the linker region of macroH2A facilitates array condensation and that this behavior is inhibited by the macro domain. Furthermore, chimeric major-type H2A arrays containing the macroH2A linker domain (H2AML) exhibited the same condensation properties as macroH2A(1–161) arrays, thus emphasizing the intriguing behavior of the macroH2A linker region.",Atomic Force Microscopy;Chromatin Structure;Histones;Nucleosome;Ultracentrifugation;Chromatin Compaction;Heterochromatin

Although these two methods have been widely used to attempt to find the correct NES position within potential NES-containing proteins, their performance has not yet been evaluated on the basic task of identifying NES-containing proteins. We propose a new predictor, NESsential, which uses sequence derived meta-features, such as predicted disorder and solvent accessibility, in addition to primary sequence. We demonstrate that it can identify promising NES-containing candidate proteins (albeit at low coverage), but other methods cannot. We also quantitatively demonstrate that predicted disorder is a useful feature for prediction and investigate the different features of (predicted) ordered versus disordered NES’s.

This is despite the fact that M. xanthus can form UV-resistant spores. Here we report evidence that M. xanthus produces its own unique group of low-molecular-weight, acid-soluble proteins that facilitate UV resistance in spores. These M. xanthus-specific SASPs vary depending upon whether spore formation is induced by starvation inside cell aggregations of fruiting bodies or is induced artificially by glycerol induction.

The teeth are continuously growing structures, matching wear at the incisal adoral end to the rate of new production at the aboral plumula. The mineral in all cases is a high magnesium calcite, but the magnesium content, crystal shape and growth pattern is different in each type of skeletal element. The crystal shape and organization into macro structures depends on the presence of an organic matrix which creates the spaces and controls the environments for crystal initiation and growth. The detailed mechanisms of crystal regulation are not known, but much work has been done on defining the proteins which appear to be involved. Phosphorylated matrix proteins may be of special importance. Biochemical isolation of proteins, construction and analysis of cDNA libraries, and most recently high-throughput proteomic analysis in conjunction with the sequencing of the complete genome have yielded a detailed list of protein components likely to be involved in the mineralization processes. However, the proteome-genome analyses have not yet provided insight into the mechanisms of crystallization, calcite composition, and orientation applicable to all skeletal elements. Although the embryonic pluteus and their spicules are the best studied system, it appears that spicule is not representative of the mature skeletal elements.

The N protein was labeled with deuterium, and the D2O concentration of the solvent was adjusted to eliminate the scattering contrast between the solvent and unlabeled BPTI, leaving only the scattering signal from the unfolded protein. The scattering profile observed in the absence of BPTI closely matched that predicted for an ensemble of random conformations. With BPTI added to a concentration of 65 mg/mL, there was a clear change in the scattering profile representing an increase in the mass fractal dimension of the unfolded protein, from 1.7 to 1.9, as expected if crowding favors more compact conformations. The crowding protein also inhibited aggregation of the unfolded protein. At 130 mg/mL BPTI, however, the fractal dimension was not significantly different from that measured at the lower concentration, contrary to the predictions of models that treat the unfolded conformations as convex particles. These results are reminiscent of the behavior of polymers in concentrated melts, suggesting that these synthetic mixtures may provide useful insights into the properties of unfolded proteins under crowding conditions.",

Many of its biophysical and functional properties have been extrapolated from truncated variants, yet the exact structural and functional role of certain segments of the protein is unclear. We found from NMR and X-ray crystallography that the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of human p53, usually defined as residues 94–292, extends beyond these domain boundaries. Trp91, in the hinge region between the disordered proline-rich N-terminal domain and the DBD, folds back onto the latter and has a cation–π interaction with Arg174. These additional interactions increase the melting temperature of the DBD by up to 2 °C and inhibit aggregation of the p53 tetramer. They also modulate the dissociation of the p53 tetramer. The absence of the Trp91/Arg174 packing presumably allows nonnative DBD–DBD interactions that both nucleate aggregation and stabilize the interface.

The essential features of procapsid assembly are conserved in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic complex double-stranded DNA viruses. Typically, a portal protein nucleates the co-polymerization of an internal scaffolding protein and the major capsid protein into an icosahedral capsid shell. The scaffolding proteins are essential to procapsid assembly. Here, we describe the solution-based biophysical and functional characterization of the bacteriophage lambda (λ) scaffolding protein gpNu3. The purified protein possesses significant α-helical structure and appears to be partially disordered. Thermally induced denaturation studies indicate that secondary structures are lost in a cooperative, apparent two-state transition (Tm =40.6±0.3 °C) and that unfolding is, at least in part, reversible. Analysis of the purified protein by size-exclusion chromatography suggests that gpNu3 is highly asymmetric, which contributes to an abnormally large Stokes radius. The size-exclusion chromatography data further indicate that the protein self-associates in a concentration-dependent manner. This was confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation studies, which reveal a monomer–dimer equilibrium (Kd,app ~50 μM) and an asymmetric protein structure at biologically relevant concentrations. Purified gpNu3 promotes the polymerization of gpE, the λ major capsid protein, into virus-like particles that possess a native-like procapsid morphology. The relevance of this work with respect to procapsid assembly in the complex double-stranded DNA viruses is discussed.",virus assembly;viral capsids;procapsid assembly;bacteriophage lambda;herpesvirus

Soluble protein oligomers exist as an intermediate between these two states, and their cytotoxicity has been implicated in the pathology of multiple human diseases. However, the mechanism by which soluble protein oligomers develop into insoluble amyloid fibrils is not clear, and investigation of this important issue is hindered by the unavailability of stable protein oligomers. Here, we have obtained stabilized protein oligomers generated from common native proteins. These oligomers exert strong cytotoxicity and display a common conformational structure shared with known protein oligomers. They are soluble and remain stable in solution. Intriguingly, the stabilized protein oligomers interact preferentially with both nucleic acids and glycosaminoglycans (GAG), which facilitates their rapid conversion into insoluble amyloid. Concomitantly, binding with nucleic acids or GAG strongly diminished the cytotoxicity of the protein oligomers. EGCG, a small molecule that was previously shown to directly bind to protein oligomers, effectively inhibits the conversion to amyloid. These results indicate that stabilized oligomers of common proteins display characteristics similar to those of disease-associated protein oligomers and represent immediate precursors of less toxic amyloid fibrils. Amyloid conversion is potently expedited by certain physiological factors, such as nucleic acids and GAGs. These findings concur with reports of cofactor involvement with disease-associated amyloid and shed light on potential means to interfere with the pathogenic properties of misfolded proteins.",Amyloid;Cell Death;Glycosaminoglycan;Nucleic Acid;Protein Folding;Oligomers Toxicity;Protein Oligomers

To understand the mechanism of TMAO induced stabilization of folded protein states, we systematically investigated the action of TMAO on several model dipeptides (Leucine, L2, Serine, S2, Glutamine, Q2, Lysine, K2, and Glycine, G2) in order to elucidate the effect of residue-specific TMAO interactions on small fragments of solvent-exposed conformations of the denatured states of proteins. We find that TMAO preferentially hydrogen bonds with the exposed dipeptide backbone, but generally not with nonpolar or polar side chains. However, interactions with the positively charged Lys are substantially greater than with the backbone. The dipeptide G2, is a useful model of pure amide backbone, interacts with TMAO by forming a hydrogen bond between the amide nitrogen and the oxygen in TMAO. In contrast, TMAO is depleted from the protein backbone in the hexapeptide G6, which shows that the length of the polypeptide chain is relevant in aqueous TMAO solutions. These simulations lead to the hypothesis that TMAO-induced stabilization of proteins and peptides is a consequence of depletion of the solute from the protein surface provided intramolecular interactions are more favorable than those between TMAO and the backbone. To test our hypothesis we performed additional simulations of the action of TMAO on an intrinsically disordered Aβ16–22 (KLVFFAE)monomer. In the absence of TMAO Aβ16–22 is a disordered random coil. However, in aqueous TMAO solution Aβ16–22 monomer samples compact conformations. A transition from random coil to α-helical secondary structure is observed at high TMAO concentrations. The coil to α-helix transition is highly cooperative especially considering the small number of residues in Aβ16–22. Our work highlights the potential similarities between the action of TMAO on long polypeptide chains and entropic stabilization of proteins in a crowded environment due to excluded volume interactions. In this sense chemical chaperone TMAO is a nano-crowding particle.",

This is made possible by the tethering of Pap1 to the Cleavage/Polyadenylation Factor (CPF) by Fip1. We have recently reported that Fip1 is an unstructured protein in solution, and proposed that it might maintain this conformation as part of CPF, when bound to Pap1. However, the role that this feature of Fip1 plays in 3′ end processing has not been investigated. We show here that Fip1 has a flexible linker in the middle of the protein, and that removal or replacement of the linker affects the efficiency of polyadenylation. However, the point of tethering is not crucial, as a fusion protein of Pap1 and Fip1 is fully functional in cells lacking genes encoding the essential individual proteins, and directly tethering Pap1 to RNA increases the rate of poly(A) addition. We also find that the linker region of Fip1 provides a platform for critical interactions with other parts of the processing machinery. Our results indicate that the Fip1 linker, through its flexibility and protein/protein interactions, allows Pap1 to reach the 3′ end of the cleaved RNA and efficiently initiate poly(A) addition.",Pap1;Fip1;polyadenylation;mRNA 3′ end processing

Many of them possess aromatic moieties, suggesting a dominant role for those in interacting with Aβ along various stages of the aggregation process. In this study, we attempt to elucidate whether interactions of such aromatic inhibitors with monomeric Aβ(12–28) point to a common mechanism of action by performing atomistic molecular dynamics simulations at equilibrium. Our results suggest that, independently of the presence of inhibitors, monomeric Aβ(12–28) populates a partially collapsed ensemble that is largely devoid of canonical secondary structure at 300 K and neutral pH. The small molecules have different affinities for Aβ(12–28) that can be partially rationalized by the balance of aromatic and charged moieties constituting the molecules. There are no predominant binding modes, although aggregation inhibitors preferentially interact with the N-terminal portion of the fragment (residues 13–20). Analysis of the free energy landscape of Aβ(12–28) reveals differences highlighted by altered populations of a looplike conformer in the presence of inhibitors. We conclude that intrinsic disorder of Aβ persists at the level of binding small molecules and that inhibitors can significantly alter properties of monomeric Aβ via multiple routes of differing specificity.",Alzheimer Disease;Computation;Intrinsically Disordered Proteins;Molecular Dynamics;Protein Aggregation;Protein Conformation;Protein Drug Interactions;Aggregation Inhibitors

An alternate method for measuring rapid HX is presented that is well-suited for larger proteins, and we apply the method to the deuterated, homodimeric 36 kDa HIV-1 integrase catalytic core domain (CCD). Using long mixing times for water-amide magnetization exchange at multiple pH values, HX rates spanning more than four orders of magnitude were measured, as well as NOE cross-relaxation rates to nearby exchangeable protons. HX protection factors for the CCD are found to be large (>104) for residues along the dimer interface, but much smaller in many other regions. Notably, the catalytic helix (residues 152-167) exhibits low HX protection at both ends, indicative of fraying at both termini as opposed to just the N-terminal end, as originally thought. Residues in the LEDGF/p75 binding pocket also show marginal stability, with protection factors in the 10–100 range (∼1.4–2.7 kcal/mol). Additionally, elevated NOE cross-relaxation rates are identified and, as expected, correspond to proximity of the amide proton to a rapidly exchanging proton, typically from an OH side chain. Indirect NOE transfer between H2O and the amide proton of I141, a residue in the partially disordered active site of the enzyme, suggests its proximity to the side chain of S147, an interaction seen in the DNA-bound form for a homologous integrase.",NMR;protein stability;dynamics;HX;retroviral integration;active site dynamics

A domain within these proteins, termed the kinase inhibitory domain (KID), is necessary and sufficient for Cdk inhibition. The KID consists of a cyclin-binding subdomain (termed D1) and a Cdk-binding subdomain (termed D2) joined by a 22-residue linker subdomain (termed LH). Before binding the Cdks, D1 and D2 are largely unstructured and the LH subdomain exhibits nascent helical characteristics. Curiously, although the sequence of the linker subdomain is not highly conserved within the family, its nascent helical structure is conserved. In this study, we explored the role of this structural conservation in interactions with cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) and cyclin A. We constructed chimeric p27-KID molecules in which the p27 LH subdomain was replaced with the corresponding segments of either p21 or p57. The chimeric molecules bind and inhibit Cdk2 in a manner similar to wild-type p27-KID. However, the extent of enthalpy/entropy compensation associated with these interactions was dramatically different, indicating different extents of LH subdomain folding upon binding. Our results indicate that the different LH subdomains, despite their sequence and thermodynamic differences, play similar roles in binding and inhibiting Cdk2/cyclin A.",

The conjugation of small organic molecules or short peptides to polypeptides from a designed set provides binder molecules that bind proteins with high affinities, and with selectivities that are equal to those of antibodies. The small organic molecules or peptides need to bind the protein targets but only with modest affinities and selectivities, because conjugation to the polypeptides results in molecules with dramatically improved binder performance. The polypeptides are selected from a set of only sixteen sequences designed to bind, in principle, any protein. The small number of polypeptides used to prepare high-affinity binders contrasts sharply with the huge libraries used in binder technologies based on selection or immunization. Also, unlike antibodies and engineered proteins, the polypeptides have unordered three-dimensional structures and adapt to the proteins to which they bind. Binder molecules for the C-reactive protein, human carbonic anhydrase II, acetylcholine esterase, thymidine kinase 1, phosphorylated proteins, the D-dimer, and a number of antibodies are used as examples to demonstrate that affinities are achieved that are higher than those of the small molecules or peptides by as much as four orders of magnitude. Evaluation by pull-down experiments and ELISA-based tests in human serum show selectivities to be equal to those of antibodies. Small organic molecules and peptides are readily available from pools of endogenous ligands, enzyme substrates, inhibitors or products, from screened small molecule libraries, from phage display, and from mRNA display. The technology is an alternative to established binder concepts for applications in drug development, diagnostics, medical imaging, and protein separation.",Binder technology;Protein;Molecular recognition;Polypeptide;Affinity;Specificity;Diagnostics

In this study, we probe the stability of fibrils prepared at pH 2.0 and composed of the protein insulin by manipulating electrostatic interactions within the fibril architecture. We demonstrate that strong electrostatic repulsion is sufficient to disrupt the hydrogen-bonded, cross-β network that links insulin molecules and ultimately results in fibril dissociation. The extent of this dissociation correlates well with predictions for colloidal models considering the net global charge of the polypeptide chain, although the kinetics of the process is regulated by the charge state of a single amino acid. We found the fibrils to be maximally stable under their formation conditions. Partial disruption of the cross-β network under conditions where the fibrils remain intact leads to a reduction in their stability. Together, these results support the contention that a major determinant of amyloid stability stems from the interactions in the structured core, and show how the control of electrostatic interactions can be used to characterize the factors that modulate fibril stability.",

Alteration in normal dopaminergic neurotransmission underlies multiple neurological diseases including schizophrenia, Huntington’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. Modulation of dopamine-regulated signaling pathways is also important in the addictive actions of most drugs of abuse. Our studies over the last 30 years have focused on the molecular actions of dopamine acting on medium spiny neurons, the predominant neurons of the neostriatum. Striatum-enriched phosphoproteins, particularly dopamine and adenosine 3′:5′-monophosphate-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa (DARPP-32), regulator of calmodulin signaling (RCS), and ARPP-16, mediate pleiotropic actions of dopamine. Notably, each of these proteins, either directly or indirectly, regulates the activity of one of the three major subclasses of serine/threonine protein phosphatases, PP1, PP2B, and PP2A, respectively. For example, phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr34 by protein kinase A results in potent inhibition of PP1, leading to potentiation of dopaminergic signaling at multiple steps from the dopamine receptor to the nucleus. The discovery of DARPP-32 and its emergence as a critical molecular integrator of striatal signaling will be discussed, as will more recent studies that highlight novel roles for RCS and ARPP-16 in dopamine-regulated striatal signaling pathways.",phosphorylation;protein phosphatase;protein kinase A;calcineurin;DARPP-32;ARPP-21;ARPP-16;RCS

In contrast to nucleosomes, FRET observed upon H1 binding to naked DNA fragments includes both intra- and inter-molecular resonance energy transfer. By eliminating inter-molecular transfer, we find that CTD condensation induced upon H1-binding naked DNA is distinct from that induced by nucleosomes. Moreover, analysis of fluorescence quenching indicates that H1 residues at either end of the CTD experience distinct environments when bound to nucleosomes, and suggest that the penultimate residue in the CTD (K195) is juxtaposed between the two linker DNA helices, proposed to form a stem structure in the H1-bound nucleosome.",

Recent spectroscopic and biological evidence shows that water has no active structuring role in the cytoplasm, an unnecessary notion still entertained in the literature; water acts only as a normal solvent and biochemical reactant. Subcellular structuring arises from localizations and interactions of biomacromolecules and from the growth and modifications of their surfaces by catalytic reactions. Biomacromolecular crowding is a fundamental physicochemical characteristic of cells in vivo. Though some biochemical and physiological effects of crowding (excluded volume effect) have been documented, crowding assays with polyglycols, dextrans, etc., do not properly mimic the compositional variety of biomacromolecules in vivo. In vitro crowding assays are now being designed with proteins, which better reflect biomacromolecular environments in vivo, allowing for hydrophobic bonding and screened electrostatic interactions. I elaborate further the concept of complex vectorial biochemistry, where crowded biomacromolecules structure the cytosol into electrolyte pathways and nanopools that electrochemically “wire” the cell. Noncovalent attractions between biomacromolecules transiently supercrowd biomacromolecules into vectorial, semiconducting multiplexes with a high (35 to 95%)-volume fraction of biomacromolecules; consequently, reservoirs of less crowded cytosol appear in order to maintain the experimental average crowding of ∼25% volume fraction.

Here we review data regarding the H1 structure and function in chromatin, with special emphasis on the C-terminal domain (CTD), which typically encompasses approximately half of the mass of the linker histone and includes a large excess of positively charged residues. Owing to its amino acid composition, the CTD was previously proposed to function in chromatin as an unstructured polycation. However, structural studies have shown that the CTD adopts detectable secondary structure when interacting with DNA and macromolecular crowding agents. We describe classic and recent experiments defining the function of this domain in chromatin folding and emerging data indicating that the function of this protein may be linked to intrinsic disorder.",core histones;nucleosome;tail domains;DNA;linker histone

The protein was labeled uniformly with nitrogen-15 and carbon-13 so that its conformation could be determined in detail both in aqueous solution and in two membrane-mimetic environments, SDS and dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles. Secondary structural elements determined from assigned chemical shifts indicated that Hsp12 is dynamically disordered in aqueous solution, whereas it gains four helical stretches in the presence of SDS micelles and a single helix in presence of DPC. These conclusions were reinforced by circular dichroism spectra of the protein in all three environments. The lack of long range interactions in NOESY spectra indicated that the helices present in SDS micelles do not pack together. R1 and R2, relaxation and heteronuclear NOE measurements showed that the protein is disordered in aqueous solution but becomes more ordered in presence of detergent micelles. NMR spectra collected in presence of paramagnetic spin relaxation agents (5DSA, 16DSA, and Gd(DTPA-BMA)) indicated that the amphipathic α-helices of Hsp12 in SDS micelles lie on the membrane surface.

Proteins in the Polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) class of the PcG are conserved from flies to humans and inhibit transcription. One hypothesis for PRC1 mechanism is that it compacts chromatin, based in part on electron microscopy experiments demonstrating that Drosophila PRC1 compacts nucleosomal arrays. We show that this function is conserved between Drosophila and mouse PRC1 complexes and requires a region with an overrepresentation of basic amino acids. While the active region is found in the Posterior Sex Combs (PSC) subunit in Drosophila, it is unexpectedly found in a different PRC1 subunit, a Polycomb homolog called M33, in mice. We provide experimental support for the general importance of a charged region by predicting the compacting capability of PcG proteins from species other than Drosophila and mice and by testing several of these proteins using solution assays and microscopy. We infer that the ability of PcG proteins to compact chromatin in vitro can be predicted by the presence of domains of high positive charge and that PRC1 components from a variety of species conserve this highly charged region.

The lack of a reliable method for predicting the conformational changes relevant to substrate binding prevents the productive application of computational docking to proteins that undergo large structural rearrangements. Here, we examine how coarse-grained normal mode analysis has been advantageously applied to modeling protein flexibility associated with ligand binding. First, we highlight recent studies that have shown that there is a close agreement between the large-scale collective motions of proteins predicted by elastic network models and the structural changes experimentally observed upon ligand binding. Then, we discuss studies that have exploited the predicted soft modes in docking simulations. Two general strategies are noted: pregeneration of conformational ensembles that are then utilized as input for standard fixed-backbone docking and protein structure deformation along normal modes concurrent to docking. These studies show that the structural changes apparently “induced” upon ligand binding occur selectively along the soft modes accessible to the protein prior to ligand binding. They further suggest that proteins offer suitable means of accommodating/facilitating the recognition and binding of their ligand, presumably acquired by evolutionary selection of the suitable three-dimensional structure.",coarse-grained normal mode analysis;collective motions;mechanism of ligand binding;elastic network models;flexible docking;intrinsic dynamics

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, homologues of the mammalian oxysterol-binding protein (Osh1–7) have been proposed to function as STPs. To evaluate this proposal we took two approaches. First we used dehydroergosterol (DHE) to visualize sterol movement in living cells by fluorescence microscopy. DHE was introduced into the PM under hypoxic conditions and observed to redistribute to lipid droplets on growing the cells aerobically. Redistribution required ATP and the sterol acyltransferase Are2, but did not require PM-derived transport vesicles. DHE redistribution occurred robustly in a conditional yeast mutant (oshΔ osh4-1ts) that lacks all functional Osh proteins at 37°C. In a second approach we used a pulse-chase protocol to analyze the movement of metabolically radiolabeled ergosterol from the ER to the PM. Arrival of radiolabeled ergosterol at the PM was assessed in isolated PM-enriched fractions as well by extracting sterols from intact cells with methyl-β-cyclodextrin. These experiments revealed that whereas ergosterol is transported effectively from the ER to the PM in Osh-deficient cells, the rate at which it moves within the PM to equilibrate with the methyl-β-cyclodextrin extractable sterol pool is slowed. We conclude (i) that the role of Osh proteins in nonvesicular sterol transport between the PM, ER and lipid droplets is either minimal, or subsumed by other mechanisms and (ii) that Osh proteins regulate the organization of sterols at the PM.",cholesterol;cyclodextrin;ergosterol;dehydroergosterol;detergent resistant membrane;endoplasmic reticulum;lipid droplet;lipid transfer protein;Osh protein;oxysterol-binding proteins;non-vesicular transport;plasma membrane;yeast

","Conformational changes upon protein-protein association are the key element of the binding mechanism. The study presents a systematic large-scale analysis of such conformational changes in the side chains. The results indicate that short and long side chains have different propensities for the conformational changes. Long side chains with three or more dihedral angles are often subject to large conformational transition. Shorter residues with one or two dihedral angles typically undergo local conformational changes not leading to a conformational transition. The relationship between the local readjustments and the equilibrium fluctuations of a side chain around its unbound conformation is suggested. Most of the side chains undergo larger changes in the dihedral angle most distant from the backbone. The frequencies of the core-to-surface interface transitions of six nonpolar residues and Tyr are larger than the frequencies of the opposite, surface-to-core transitions. The binding increases both polar and nonpolar interface areas. However, the increase of the nonpolar area is larger for all considered classes of protein complexes, suggesting that the protein association perturbs the unbound interfaces to increase the hydrophobic contribution to the binding free energy. To test modeling approaches to side-chain flexibility in protein docking, conformational changes in the X-ray set were compared with those in the docking decoys sets. The results lead to a better understanding of the conformational changes in proteins and suggest directions for efficient conformational sampling in docking protocols.",protein binding;protein recognition;structure prediction;side-chain rotamers;structural flexibility

Skeel: ude.eudrup.sc@leeks ;∗Corresponding author ude.eudrup.sc@leeks","Binding free energies are calculated for the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated complexes between the kinase inducible domain (KID) of the DNA transcriptional activator cAMP response element binding (CREB) protein and the KIX domain of its coactivator, CREB-binding protein (CBP). To our knowledge, this is the first application of a method based on a potential of mean force (PMF) with restraining potentials to compute the binding free energy of protein-protein complexes. The KID:KIX complexes are chosen here because of their biological relevance to the DNA transcription process and their relatively small size (81 residues for the KIX domain of CBP, and 28 residues for KID). The results for pKID:KIX and KID:KIX are −9.55 and −4.96 kcal/mol, respectively, in good agreement with experimental estimates (−8.8 and −5.8 kcal/mol, respectively). A comparison between specific contributions to protein-protein binding for the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated complexes reveals a dual role for the phosphorylation of KID at Ser-133 in effecting a more favorable free energy of the bound system: 1), stabilization of the unbound conformation of phosphorylated KID due to favorable intramolecular interactions of the phosphate group of Ser-133 with the charged groups of an arginine-rich region spanning both α-helices, which lowers the configurational entropy; and 2), more favorable intermolecular electrostatic interactions between pSer-133 and Arg-131 of KID, and Lys-662, Tyr-658, and Glu-666 of KIX. Charge reduction through ligand phosphorylation emerges as a possible mechanism for controlling the unbound state conformation of KID and, ultimately, gene expression. This work also demonstrates that the PMF-based method with restraining potentials provides an added benefit in that important elements of the binding pathway are evidenced.

Our understanding of PDE6 catalysis and structure suffers from inadequate characterization of the α and β subunit catalytic core, interactions of the core with two intrinsically–disordered, proteolysis–prone inhibitory PDEγ (Pγ) subunits, and binding of two isoprenyl–binding proteins δ, called PrBP/δ, to the isoprenylated C–termini of the catalytic core. Structural studies of native PDE6 have been also been hampered by lack of a heterologous expression system for the holo–enzyme. In this work, we purified PDE6 in the presence of PrBP/δ and screened for additives and detergents that selectively suppress PDE6 basal activity while sparing that of the trypsin–activated enzyme. Some detergents removed PrBP/δ from the PDE complex, separating it from the holo–enzyme after PDE6 purification. Additionally, selected detergents also significantly reduced dissociation of PDE6 subunits, increasing its homogeneity, and stabilizing the holo–enzyme by substituting for its native membrane environment.",

Serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins play essential roles in precursor mRNA constitutive and alternative splicing and have been suggested to be crucial in plant-specific forms of developmental regulation and environmental adaptation. Despite their functional importance, little is known about their origin and evolutionary history. SR splicing factors have a modular organization featuring at least one RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain and a carboxyl-terminal region enriched in serine/arginine dipeptides. To investigate the evolution of SR proteins, we infer phylogenies for more than 12,000 RRM domains representing more than 200 broadly sampled organisms. Our analyses reveal that the RRM domain is not restricted to eukaryotes and that all prototypical SR proteins share a single ancient origin, including the plant-specific SR45 protein. Based on these findings, we propose a scenario for their diversification into four natural families, each corresponding to a main SR architecture, and a dozen subfamilies, of which we profile both sequence conservation and composition. Finally, using operational criteria for computational discovery and classification, we catalog SR proteins in 20 model organisms, with a focus on green algae and land plants. Altogether, our study confirms the homogeneity and antiquity of SR splicing factors while establishing robust phylogenetic relationships between animal and plant proteins, which should enable functional analyses of lesser characterized SR family members, especially in green plants.",

To gain further insight into the molecular mechanism of amelogenin nanosphere formation, we manipulated the interactions between amelogenin monomers by altering pH, temperature, and protein concentration to create isolated metastable amelogenin oligomers. Recombinant porcine amelogenins (rP172 and rP148) and three different mutants containing only a single tryptophan (Trp161, Trp45, and Trp25) were used. Dynamic light scattering and fluorescence studies demonstrated that oligomers were metastable and in constant equilibrium with monomers. Stable oligomers with an average hydrodynamic radius (RH) of 7.5 nm were observed at pH 5.5 between 4 and 10 mg·ml−1. We did not find any evidence of a significant increase in folding upon self-association of the monomers into oligomers, indicating that they are disordered. Fluorescence experiments with single tryptophan amelogenins revealed that upon oligomerization the C terminus of amelogenin (around residue Trp161) is exposed at the surface of the oligomers, whereas the N-terminal region around Trp25 and Trp45 is involved in protein-protein interaction. The truncated rP148 formed similar but smaller oligomers, suggesting that the C terminus is not critical for amelogenin oligomerization. We propose a model for nanosphere formation via oligomers, and we predict that nanospheres will break up to form oligomers in mildly acidic environments via histidine protonation. We further suggest that oligomeric structures might be functional components during maturation of enamel apatite.",Extracellular Matrix Proteins;Protein Chemistry;Protein Self-assembly;Protein-Protein Interactions;Tryptophan;Amelogenin;Dynamic Light Scattering;Enamel;Fluorescence Spectroscopy;Oligomerization

In contrast, the roles of the poorly structured, variable length C-terminal regions present on Hsp70s remain unclear. In many eukaryotic Hsp70s, the extreme C-terminal EEVD tetrapeptide sequence associates with co-chaperones via binding to tetratricopeptide repeat domains. It is not known whether this is the only function for this region in eukaryotic Hsp70s and what roles this region performs in Hsp70s that do not form complexes with tetratricopeptide repeat domains. We compared C-terminal sequences of 730 Hsp70 family members and identified a novel conservation pattern in a diverse subset of 165 bacterial and organellar Hsp70s. Mutation of conserved C-terminal sequence in DnaK, the predominant Hsp70 in Escherichia coli, results in significant impairment of its protein refolding activity in vitro without affecting interdomain allostery, interaction with co-chaperones DnaJ and GrpE, or the binding of a peptide substrate, defying classical explanations for the chaperoning mechanism of Hsp70. Moreover, mutation of specific conserved sites within the DnaK C terminus reduces the capacity of the cell to withstand stresses on protein folding caused by elevated temperature or the absence of other chaperones. These features of the C-terminal region support a model in which it acts as a disordered tether linked to a conserved, weak substrate-binding motif and that this enhances chaperone function by transiently interacting with folding clients.",Escherichia coli;Heat Shock Protein;Intrinsically Disordered Proteins;Molecular Chaperone;Protein Folding;Stress Response;DnaK;Hsp70

Author for correspondence: Tel.: +1 734 615 9537, ude.hcimu@kciwtseg","Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that accumulates in at least 15 different neurodegenerative disorders, which are collectively referred to as tauopathies. In these diseases, tau is often hyperphosphorylated and found in aggregates, including paired helical filaments, neurofibrillary tangles and other abnormal oligomers. Tau aggregates are associated with neuron loss and cognitive decline, which suggests that this protein can somehow evade normal quality control allowing it to aberrantly accumulate and become proteotoxic. Consistent with this idea, recent studies have shown that molecular chaperones, such as heat shock protein 70 and heat shock protein 90, counteract tau accumulation and neurodegeneration in disease models. These molecular chaperones are major components of the protein quality control systems and they are specifically involved in the decision to retain or degrade many proteins, including tau and its modified variants. Thus, one potential way to treat tauopathies might be to either accelerate interactions of abnormal tau with these quality control factors or tip the balance of triage towards tau degradation. In this review, we summarize recent findings and suggest models for therapeutic intervention.",

Here, we describe amyloid aggregation, preferred species, cross-species barriers and transmission within the broad framework of molecular recognition. Cross seeding of amyloid species is governed by conformational selection of compatible (complementary) states. If the dominant conformations of two species are similar, they can cross-seed each other; on the other hand, if they are sufficiently different, they will grow into different fibrils, reflecting species barriers. Such a scenario has recently been observed for the tau protein which has four repeats. While a construct consisting of repeats 1, 3 and 4 can serve as a seed for the entire 4-repeat tau segment, the inverse does not hold. On the other hand, the tau protein repeats with the characteristic U-turn shape can cross-seed Alzheimer’s Aβ, and similarly the Islet Amyloid Polypeptide (IAPP). Within this framework, we suggest that the so-called ‘central dogma’ of amyloid formation, where aggregation takes place through non-specific backbone hydrogen bonding interactions which are common to all peptides and proteins, is a simple reflection of the heterogeneous, polymorphic free energy landscape of amyloid species. Here, we review available data and make some propositions addressing this key problem. In particular, we argue that recent theoretical and experimental observations support the key role of selective molecular recognition in amyloidosis and in determining cross-species barriers and transmission.",beta-amyloid oligomers;amyloid fibril structures;Alzheimer’s disease;prion;conformational selection;nucleation polymerization;energy landscape;conformational diseases

Here, we report that the alternatively spliced isoform of RIL, denoted here as RILaltCterm, functions as a dominant-negative modulator of RIL-mediated actin reorganization. RILaltCterm is regulated at the level of protein stability, and this protein isoform accumulates particularly in response to oxidative stress. We show that the alternative C-terminal segment of RILaltCterm has a disordered structure that directs the protein to rapid degradation in the core 20 S proteasomes. Such degradation is ubiquitin-independent and can be blocked by binding to NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase NQO1, a detoxifying enzyme induced by prolonged exposure to oxidative stress. We show that either overexpression of RILaltCterm or its stabilization by stresses counteracts the effects produced by full-length RIL on organization of actin cytoskeleton and cell motility.

Such quaternary structure equilibria may be influenced in a physiologically significant manner either by covalent modification or by the non-covalent binding of ligands. This review follows the evolution of ideas about homo-oligomeric equilibria through the 20th and into the 21st centuries and the relationship of these equilibria to allosteric regulation by the non-covalent binding of ligands. A dynamic quaternary structure equilibria is described where the dissociated state can have alternate conformations that cannot reassociate to the original multimer; the alternate conformations dictate assembly to functionally distinct alternate multimers of finite stoichiometry. The functional distinction between different assemblies provides a mechanism for allostery. The requirement for dissociation distinguishes this morpheein model of allosteric regulation from the classical MWC concerted and KNF sequential models. These models are described alongside earlier dissociating allosteric models. The identification of proteins that exist as an equilibrium of diverse native quaternary structure assemblies has the potential to define new targets for allosteric modulation with significant consequences for further understanding and/or controlling protein structure and function. Thus, a rationale for identifying proteins that may use the morpheein model of allostery is presented and a selection of proteins for which published data suggests this mechanism may be operative are listed.",Allostery;protein multimer;morpheein;moonlighting

The S-peptide from ribonuclease S forms its α-helical structure only upon binding to the folded S-protein. We characterized the transition state for this binding-induced folding reaction at high resolution by determining the effect of site-specific backbone thioxylation and side-chain modifications on the kinetics and thermodynamics of the reaction, which allows us to monitor formation of backbone hydrogen bonds and side-chain interactions in the transition state. The experiments reveal that α-helical structure in the S-peptide is absent in the transition state of binding. Recognition between the unfolded S-peptide and the S-protein is mediated by loosely packed hydrophobic side-chain interactions in two well defined regions on the S-peptide. Close packing and helix formation occurs rapidly after binding.

Ligand binding is measured using a high-throughput NMR ligand affinity screen with a structurally diverse chemical library. The method was demonstrated using a set of 19 proteins with a range of functions. A statistically significant similarity in ligand binding profiles was only observed between the two functionally identical albumins and between the five functionally similar amylases. This new approach is independent of sequence, structure or evolutionary information, and therefore, extends our ability to analyze and functionally annotate novel genes.",Protein Function;Ligand Binding;NMR Ligand Affinity Screen;Functional Genomics;Functional Annotation

These FnBP IDRs consist of Fn-binding repeats (FnBRs) that form a highly extended tandem β-zipper interaction on binding to the N-terminal domain of Fn. Several FnBR residues are highly conserved across bacterial species, and here we investigate their contribution to the interaction. Mutation of these residues to alanine in SfbI-5 (a disordered FnBR from the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes) reduced binding, but for each residue the change in free energy of binding was <2 kcal/mol. The structure of an SfbI-5 peptide in complex with the second and third F1 modules from Fn confirms that the conserved FnBR residues play equivalent functional roles across bacterial species. Thus, in SfbI-5, the binding energy for the tandem β-zipper interaction with Fn is distributed across the interface rather than concentrated in a small number of “hot spot” residues that are frequently observed in the interactions of folded proteins. We propose that this might be a common feature of the interactions of IDRs and is likely to pose a challenge for the development of small molecule inhibitors of FnBP-mediated adhesion to and invasion of host cells.",Fibronectin;Host-Pathogen Interactions;Isothermal Titration Calorimetry;Protein Complexes;Protein Structure;Protein-Protein Interactions

Although tyrosine phosphorylation is central to the initiation of both inhibitory ITIM and stimulatory ITAM signaling, the events that regulate receptor phosphorylation are incompletely understood. Previous studies have shown that ITAM tyrosines engage in structure-inducing interactions with the plasma membrane that must be relieved for phosphorylation to occur. Whether ITIM phosphorylation is similarly regulated and the mechanisms responsible for release from plasma membrane interactions to enable phosphorylation, however, have not been defined. PECAM-1 is a dual ITIM-containing receptor that inhibits ITAM-dependent responses in hematopoietic cells. We found that the PECAM-1 cytoplasmic domain is unstructured in an aqueous environment but adopts an α-helical conformation within a localized region on interaction with lipid vesicles that mimic the plasma membrane. The lipid-interacting segment contains the C-terminal ITIM tyrosine and a serine residue that undergo activation-dependent phosphorylation. The N-terminal ITIM is excluded from the lipid-interacting segment, and its phosphorylation is secondary to phosphorylation of the membrane-interacting C-terminal ITIM. On the basis of these findings, we propose a novel model for regulation of inhibitory signaling by ITIM-containing receptors that relies on reversible plasma membrane interactions and sequential ITIM phosphorylation.",

The effects of polyglutamine length and peptide concentration on the kinetics of aggregation were previously analyzed using a homogeneous nucleation model that assumes the presence of a single bottleneck along the free energy profile G(n), where n denotes the number of polyglutamine molecules. The observation of stable, soluble oligomers as intermediates along aggregation pathways is refractory to the assumptions of homogeneous nucleation. Furthermore, the analysis of in vitro kinetic data using a specific variant of homogeneous nucleation leads to confounding observations such as fractional and / or negative values for estimates of the critical nucleus size. Here, we show that the homogeneous nucleation model is inherently robust and is unlikely to yield fractional values if the underlying process is strictly homogeneous with a free energy profile G(n) that displays a sharp maximum at n=n*, where n* corresponds to the critical nucleus. Conversely, a model that includes oligomers of different size and different potentials for supporting turnover into fibrils yields estimates of fractional and / or negative nucleus sizes when the kinetic data are analyzed using the assumption of a homogeneous process. This model provides a route to reconcile independent observations of heterogeneous distributions of oligomers and other non-fibrillar aggregates with results obtained from analysis of aggregation kinetics using the assumption of a homogeneous nucleation model. In the new model, the mechanisms of fibril assembly are governed by the relative stabilities of two types of oligomers viz., fibril-competent and fibril-incompetent oligomers, the size of the smallest fibril competent oligomer, and rates for conformational conversion within different oligomers.",

These pathogenic E. coli express a syringe like protein machine, known as the type III secretion system (T3SS), used for the injection of virulence factors into the cytosol of the host epithelial cell. Breaching the epithelial plasma membrane requires formation of a translocation pore that contains the secreted protein EspD. Here we demonstrate that the N-terminal segment of EspD, encompassing residues 1–171, contains two amphipathic domains spanning residues 24–41 and 66–83, with the latter of these helices being critical for EspD function. Fluorescence and circular dichroism analysis revealed that, in solution, His6-EspD1-171 adopts a native disordered structure; however, on binding anionic small unilamellar vesicles composed of phosphatidylserine, His6-EspD1-171 undergoes a pH depended conformational change that increases the α-helix content of this protein ~7-fold. This change coincides with insertion of the region circumscribing Trp47 into the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer. On the HeLa cell plasma membrane, His6-EspD1-171 forms a homodimer that is postulated to promote EspD-EspD oligomerization and pore formation.

","Post-translational modifications offer a dynamic way to regulate protein activity, subcellular localization and stability. Here we estimate the effect of phosphorylation on protein binding and function for different types of complexes from human proteome. We find that phosphorylation sites have a tendency to be located on binding interfaces in heterooligomeric and weak transient homooligomeric complexes. The analysis of molecular mechanisms of phosphorylation shows that phosphorylation may modulate the strength of interactions directly on interfaces and binding hotspots have a tendency to be phosphorylated in heterooligomers. Although majority of phosphosites do not show significant estimated stability differences upon attaching the phosphate groups, for about one third of all complexes it causes relatively large changes in binding energy. We discuss the cases where phosphorylation mediates the complex formation and regulates the function. We show that phosphorylation sites are not only more likely to be evolutionary conserved than surface residues but even more so than other interfacial residues.",

","SR proteins are essential splicing factors whose phosphorylation by the SRPK family of protein kinases regulates nuclear localization and mRNA processing activity. In addition to an N-terminal extension with unknown function, SRPKs contain a large, non-homologous spacer insert domain that bifurcates the kinase domain and anchors the kinase in the cytoplasm through interactions with chaperones. While structures for the kinase domain are now available, constructs that include regions outside this domain have been resistant to crystallographic elucidation. To investigate the conformation of the full-length kinase and the functional role of noncatalytic regions, hydrogen-deuterium exchange and steady-state kinetic experiments were performed on SRPK1. Unlike the kinase core, the large spacer insert domain lacks stable, hydrogen-bonded structure and may provide an intrinsically disordered region for chaperone interactions. Conversely, the N-terminus, which positively regulates SR protein binding, adopts stable structure when the insert domain is present and stabilizes a docking groove in the large lobe of the kinase domain. The N-terminus and spacer insert domain equally enhance SR protein turnover by altering the stability of several catalytic loop segments. These studies reveal that SRPK1 uses an N-terminal extension and a large, intrinsically disordered region juxtaposed to stable structure to facilitate high affinity SR protein interactions and phosphorylation rates.",kinetics;hydrogen-deuterium exchange;phosphorylation;splicing;SR protein

In the present study, the top down MSMS approach combined with Traveling Wave Ion Mobility (TWIM) separation was evaluated for its ability to achieve high sequence coverage and to reveal subtle micro-heterogeneities that were hitherto only accessible with FTICR-MS instruments. The power of this approach is herein illustrated in an in-depth analysis of both wt and K496C variant of the recombinant X domain (XD, aa 459-507) of the measles virus phosphoprotein expressed in E. coli. Using top down MSMS combined to TWIM, we show that XD samples occasionally exhibit a micro-heterogeneity that could not be anticipated from the nucleotide sequence of the encoding constructs and that likely reflects a genetic drift, neutral or not, occurring during expression. In addition, an MTSL nitroxide probe that was grafted on the K496C XD variant was shown to undergo oxidation and/or protonation in the ESI source leading to artifactual mass increases.",

Spritz was extended to filter predictions based on structural homologues. After extensive testing, predictions are combined by averaging their probabilities. The CSpritz website can elaborate single or multiple predictions for either short or long disorder. The server provides a global output page, for download and simultaneous statistics of all predictions. Links are provided to each individual protein where the amino acid sequence and disorder prediction are displayed along with statistics for the individual protein. As a novel feature, CSpritz provides information about structural homologues as well as secondary structure and short functional linear motifs in each disordered segment. Benchmarking was performed on the very recent CASP9 data, where CSpritz would have ranked consistently well with a Sw measure of 49.27 and AUC of 0.828.

The SEVI precursor PAP248-286 is mostly disordered when bound to detergent micelles, in contrast to the highly α-helical structures found for most amyloid proteins. To determine the origin of this difference, the structures of PAP248-286 were solved in aqueous solution and with 30% and 50% trifluoroethanol. In solution, pulsed field gradient (PFG)-NMR and 1H-1H NOESY experiments indicate that PAP248-286 is unfolded to an unusual degree for an amyloidogenic peptide but adopts significantly helical structures in TFE solutions. The clear differences between the structures of PAP248-286 in TFE and SDS indicate electrostatic interactions play a large role in the folding of the peptide, consistent with the slight degree of penetration of PAP248-286 into the hydrophobic core of the micelle. This is another noticeable difference between PAP248-286 and other amyloid peptides, which generally show penetration into at least the headgroup region of the bilayer, and may explain some of the unusual properties of SEVI.",Amyloid;SEVI;Natively Disordered;Structure;NMR

Here, we defined a fragment of tvMyb2 comprising residues 40–156 (tvMyb240–156) as the minimum structural unit that retains near full binding affinity with the promoter DNAs. Like c-Myb in vertebrates, the DNA-free tvMyb240–156 has a flexible and open conformation. Upon binding to the promoter DNA elements, tvMyb240–156 undergoes significant conformational re-arrangement and structure stabilization. Crystal structures of tvMyb240–156 in complex with promoter element-containing DNA oligomers showed that 5′-a/gACGAT-3′ is the specific base sequence recognized by tvMyb240–156, which does not fully conform to that of the Myb binding site sequence. Furthermore, Lys49, which is upstream of the R2 motif (amino acids 52–102) also participates in specific DNA sequence recognition. Intriguingly, tvMyb240–156 binds to the promoter elements in an orientation opposite to that proposed in the HADDOCK model of the tvMyb135–141/MRE-1-MRE-2r complex.

Chirikjian,"Department of Mechanical Engineering Johns Hopkins University Baltimore, MD 21218, USA","Proteins fold from a highly disordered state into a highly ordered one. Traditionally, the folding problem has been stated as one of predicting ‘the’ tertiary structure from sequential information. However, new evidence suggests that the ensemble of unfolded forms may not be as disordered as once believed, and that the native form of many proteins may not be described by a single conformation, but rather an ensemble of its own. Quantifying the relative disorder in the folded and unfolded ensembles as an entropy difference may therefore shed light on the folding process. One issue that clouds discussions of ‘entropy’ is that many different kinds of entropy can be defined: entropy associated with overall translational and rotational Brownian motion, configurational entropy, vibrational entropy, conformational entropy computed in internal or Cartesian coordinates (which can even be different from each other), conformational entropy computed on a lattice; each of the above with different solvation and solvent models; thermodynamic entropy measured experimentally, etc. The focus of this work is the conformational entropy of coil/loop regions in proteins. New mathematical modeling tools for the approximation of changes in conformational entropy during transition from unfolded to folded ensembles are introduced. In particular, models for computing lower and upper bounds on entropy for polymer models of polypeptide coils both with and without end constraints are presented.

This is a somewhat rough estimate because of context-dependency.53 For the bonuses and penalties, we assess the contribution of additional hydrogen bonds to the free-energy. The free-energy of the hydrogen bond is again offset to some degree by solvation, though not as strongly as for the backbone. The rough bonus weights were used for this study. The extra weighting of NN over QQ is justified in two ways. First, asparagine (N) has a shorter distance from backbone to amide than does glutamine (Q). Additionally, experimental data43 suggests that in at least one prion, replacing all glutamines with asparagines provides better stability of the prion-fold as compared to replacing all asparagines with glutamines.

However, [URE3] and [PSI+] were discovered by serendipity in genetic screens. Cataloging the full range of prions in yeast or in other organisms will therefore require more systematic search methods. Taking advantage of some of the unique features of prions, various researchers have developed bioinformatic and experimental methods for identifying novel prion proteins. These methods have generated long lists of prion candidates. The systematic testing of some of these prion candidates has led to notable successes; however, even in yeast, where rapid growth rate and ease of genetic manipulation aid in testing for prion activity, such candidate testing is laborious. Development of better methods to winnow the field of prion candidates will greatly aid in the discovery of new prions, both in yeast and in other organisms, and help us to better understand the role of prions in biology.",yeast;prion;bioinformatics;Sup35;[PSI+];Ure2;[URE3]

The reactions are catalyzed by a dedicated methyltransferase and dedicated methylesterase. In Escherichia coli and related organisms, control of these enzymes includes an evolutionarily recent addition of interaction with a pentapeptide activator located at the carboxyl terminus of the receptor polypeptide chain. Effective enzyme activation requires not only the pentapeptide but also a segment of the receptor polypeptide chain between that sequence and the coiled-coil body of the chemoreceptor. This segment has features consistent with a role as a flexible and presumably unstructured linker and enzyme tether, but there has been no direct information about its structure. We used site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to characterize structural features of the carboxyl-terminal 40 residues of E. coli chemoreceptor Tar. Beginning ∼ 35 residues from the carboxyl terminus and continuing to the end of the protein, spectra of spin-labeled Tar embedded in native membranes or in reconstituted proteoliposomes, exhibited mobilities characteristic of unstructured, disordered segments. Binding of methyltransferase substantially reduced mobility for positions in or near the pentapeptide but mobility for the linker sequence remained high, being only modestly reduced in a gradient of decreasing effects for 10–15 residues, a pattern consistent with the linker providing a flexible arm that would allow enzyme diffusion within defined limits. Thus, our data identify that the carboxyl-terminal linker between the receptor body and the pentapeptide is an unstructured, disordered segment that can serve as a flexible arm and enzyme tether.",bacterial chemotaxis;disordered protein segments;sensory adaptation;EPR spectroscopy;receptor methyltransferase

We probed the interaction of α-synuclein and its A30P variant with lipid vesicles by using fluorescence anisotropy and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance. Both proteins interact strongly with large unilamellar vesicles whose composition is similar to that of the inner mitochondrial membrane, which contains cardiolipin. However, the proteins have no affinity for vesicles mimicking the outer mitochondrial membrane, which lacks cardiolipin. The 19F data show that the interaction involves α-synuclein’s N-terminal region. These data indicate that the middle of the N-terminal region, which contains the KAKEGVVAAAE repeats, is involved in binding, probably via electrostatic interactions between the lysines and cardiolipin. We also found that the strength of α-synuclein binding depends on the nature of the cardiolipin acyl side chains. Eliminating one double bond increases affinity, while complete saturation dramatically decreases affinity. Increasing the temperature increases the binding of wild-type, but not the A30P variant. The data are interpreted in terms of the properties of the protein, cardiolipin demixing within the vesicles upon binding of α-synuclein, and packing density. The results advance our understanding of α-synuclein’s interaction with mitochondrial membranes.",

During the last mitosis, the daughter cells located near or in contact with the basement membrane (BM) become presecretory prepolarized odontoblasts. The daughter cells located some distance away from the BM form the Höehl’s layer.

The challenge is magnified by the inheritance of mutations that render individual proteins subject to misfolding and/or aggregation. Maintenance of the proteome requires the orchestration of protein synthesis, folding, degradation, and trafficking by highly conserved/deeply integrated cellular networks. In humans, no less than 2000 genes are involved. Stress sensors detect the misfolding and aggregation of proteins in specific organelles and respond by activating stress-responsive signaling pathways. These culminate in transcriptional and posttranscriptional programs that up-regulate the homeostatic mechanisms unique to that organelle. Proteostasis is also strongly influenced by the general properties of protein folding that are intrinsic to every proteome. These include the kinetics and thermodynamics of the folding, misfolding, and aggregation of individual proteins. We examine a growing body of evidence establishing that when cellular proteostasis goes awry, it can be reestablished by deliberate chemical and biological interventions. We start with approaches that employ chemicals or biological agents to enhance the general capacity of the proteostasis network. We then introduce chemical approaches to prevent the misfolding or aggregation of specific proteins through direct binding interactions. We finish with evidence that synergy is achieved with the combination of mechanistically distinct approaches to reestablish organismal proteostasis.",

Its mechanism of action has been speculated to involve pore formation based on prior site-directed spin labeling studies. This study examines four single-site β-thiocyanatoalanine variants of CM15 in which the artificial amino acid side chain acts as a vibrational reporter of its local environment through the frequency and lineshape of the unique CN stretching band in the infrared spectrum. Circular dichroism experiments indicate that the placements of the artificial side chain have only small perturbative effects on the membrane-bound secondary structure of the CM15 peptide. All variant peptides were placed in buffer solution, in contact with dodecylphosphatidylcholine micelles, and in contact with vesicles formed from E. coli polar lipid extract. At each site, the CN stretching band reports a different behavior. Time-dependent attenuated total reflectance infrared spectra were also collected for each variant as it was allowed to remodel the E. coli lipid vesicles. These experiments agree with the previously proposed formation of toroidal pores, in which each peptide finds itself in an increasingly homogeneous and curved local environment without apparent peptide-peptide interactions. This work also demonstrates the excellent sensitivity of the SCN stretching vibration to small changes in peptide-lipid interfacial structure.",antimicrobial peptides;cyanylated cysteine;nitrile vibrations;membrane-active peptides;site-directed labeling;toroidal pores

We used spin labelling and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to elucidate the structural and dynamic bases of autoinhibition and activation of the kinase domain of CaMKII. In contrast to existing models, we find that autoinhibition involves a conformeric equilibrium of the regulatory domain, modulating substrate and nucleotide access. Binding of calmodulin to the regulatory domain induces conformational changes that release the catalytic cleft, activating the kinase and exposing an otherwise inaccessible phosphorylation site, threonine 286. Autophosphorylation at Thr286 further disrupts the interactions between the catalytic and regulatory domains, enhancing the interaction with calmodulin, but maintains the regulatory domain in a dynamic unstructured conformation following dissociation of calmodulin, sustaining activation.

While almost all deposited amyloid fibers share a common nonbranched morphology, the affected end organs, clinical presentation, treatment strategies, and prognosis vary greatly among this group of diseases and are largely dependent on the specific amyloid precursor protein. To date, at least 27 precursor proteins have been identified to result in either local tissue or systemic amyloidosis, with nine of them manifesting in cardiac deposition and resulting in a syndrome termed “cardiac amyloidosis” or “amyloid cardiomyopathy.” Although cardiac amyloidosis has been traditionally considered to be a rare disorder, as clinical appreciation and understanding continues to grow, so too has the prevalence, suggesting that this disease may be greatly underdiagnosed. The most common form of cardiac amyloidosis is associated with circulating amyloidogenic monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain proteins. Other major cardiac amyloidoses result from a misfolding of products of mutated or wild-type transthyretin protein. While the various cardiac amyloidoses share a common functional consequence, namely, an infiltrative cardiomyopathy with restrictive pathophysiology leading to progressive heart failure, the underlying pathophysiology and clinical syndrome varies with each precursor protein.

Analytical ultracentrifugation has been a fundamental technique in the determination of macromolecular reaction stoichiometry and energetics for 85 years. This approach is highly amenable to the extraction of thermodynamic couplings to small molecule binding in the overall reaction pathway. In the 1980’s this approach was extended to the use of sedimentation velocity techniques, primarily by the analysis of tubulin-drug interactions by Na and Timasheff. This transport method necessarily incorporates the complexity of both hydrodynamic and thermodynamic nonideality. The advent of modern computational methods in the last 20 years has subsequently made the analysis of sedimentation velocity data for interacting systems more robust and rigorous. Here we review three examples where sedimentation velocity has been useful at extracting thermodynamic information about reaction stoichiometry and energetics.

Understanding and developing rational treatments for cancer requires a definition of the key molecular targets and how they interact to elicit the complex growth deregulation phenotype. Viral proteins provide discerning and powerful probes to understand both how cells work and how they can be manipulated using a minimal number of components. The small DNA viruses have evolved to target inherent weaknesses in cellular protein interaction networks to hijack the cellular DNA and protein replication machinery. In the battle to escape the inevitability of senescence and programmed cell death, cancers have converged on similar mechanisms, through the acquisition and selection of somatic mutations that drive unchecked cellular replication in tumors. Understanding the dynamic mechanisms through which a minimal number of viral proteins promote host cells to undergo unscheduled and pathological replication is a powerful strategy to identify critical targets that are also disrupted in cancer. Viruses can therefore be used as tools to probe the system-wide protein-protein interactions and structures that drive growth deregulation in human cells. Ultimately this can provide a path for developing system context-dependent therapeutics.

Despite sharing a common fold, the eukaryotic histones of the core nucleosome and archaeal histones fold by kinetic mechanisms of differing complexity with transient population of partially folded monomeric and/or dimeric species. No relationship was apparent between fibrillation propensity and equilibrium stability or population of kinetic intermediates. Only H3 and H4, as isolated monomers and as a heterodimer, readily formed fibrils at room temperature, and this propensity correlates with the significantly lower solubility of these polypeptides. The fibrils were characterized by ThT fluorescence, FTIR, and far-UV CD spectroscopies and electron microscopy. The helical histone fold comprises the protease-resistant core of the fibrils, with little or no protease protection of the poorly structured N-terminal tails. The highly charged tails inhibit fibrillation through electrostatic repulsion. Kinetic studies indicate that H3 and H4 form a co-fibril, with simultaneous incorporation of both histones. The potential impact of H3 and H4 fibrillation on the cytotoxicity of extracellular histones and α-synuclein-mediated neurotoxicity and fibrillation is considered.",protein folding intermediates;oligomeric proteins;aggregation;amyloid;domain-swapping

Here we present a novel and generally applicable solution NMR technique, known as Dark-state Exchange Saturation Transfer (DEST), to probe such exchange phenomena with atomic resolution. This is illustrated by the exchange reaction between amyloid β (Aβ) monomers and polydisperse, NMR invisible ('dark') protofibrils, a process of significant interest since the accumulation of toxic, aggregated forms of Aβ, from small oligomers to very large assemblies, have been implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease1–6. The 15N-DEST experiment imprints with single residue resolution dynamic information on the protofibril-bound species in the form of 15N transverse relaxation rates (15N-R2) and exchange kinetics between monomers and protofibrils onto the easily observed two-dimensional 1H-15N correlation spectrum of the monomer. The exchanging species on the protofibril surface comprise an ensemble of sparsely-populated states where each residue is either tethered to (via other residues) or in direct contact with the surface. The first eight residues exist predominantly in a mobile tethered state`, while the largely hydrophobic central region and part of the C-terminal hydrophobic region are in direct contact with the protofibril surface for a significant proportion of the time. The C-terminal residues of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 display lower affinity for the protofibril surface indicating that they are likely to be surface exposed rather than buried as in structures of Aβ fibrils7–10, and may therefore comprise the critical nucleus for fibril formation11,12.

Conformational transitions are commonly observed in various protein interactions that are involved in important biological functions. For example, copper–zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), which destroys free superoxide radicals in the body, undergoes a large conformational transition from an ‘open’ state (apo structure) to a ‘closed’ state (holo structure). Many studies have utilized collections of apo–holo structure pairs to investigate the conformational transitions and critical residues. However, the collection process is usually complicated, varies from study to study and produces a small-scale data set. AH-DB is designed to provide an easy and unified way to prepare such data, which is generated by identifying/mapping molecules in different Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries. Conformational transitions are identified based on a refined alignment scheme to overcome the challenge that many structures in the PDB database are only protein fragments and not complete proteins. There are 746 314 apo–holo pairs in AH-DB, which is about 30 times those in the second largest collection of similar data. AH-DB provides sophisticated interfaces for searching apo–holo structure pairs and exploring conformational transitions from apo structures to the corresponding holo structures.",

Essentially the entire MeCP2 polypeptide chain underwent H/DX at rates faster than could be measured (i.e. complete exchange in ≤10 s), with the exception of the methyl DNA binding domain (MBD). Even the H/DX of the MBD was rapid compared with that of a typical globular protein. Thus, there is no single tertiary structure of MeCP2. Rather, the full-length protein rapidly samples many different conformations when free in solution. When MeCP2 binds to unmethylated DNA, H/DX is slowed several orders of magnitude throughout the MBD. Binding of MeCP2 to methylated DNA led to additional minor H/DX protection, and only locally within the N-terminal portion of the MBD. H/DX also was used to examine the structural dynamics of the isolated MBD carrying three frequent mutations associated with Rett syndrome. The effects of the mutations ranged from very little (R106W) to a substantial increase in conformational sampling (F155S). Our H/DX results have yielded fine resolution mapping of the structure of full-length MeCP2 in the absence and presence of DNA, provided a biochemical basis for understanding MeCP2 function in normal cells, and predicted potential approaches for the treatment of a subset of RTT cases caused by point mutations that destabilize the MBD.",Chromatin;DNA Binding Protein;Mass Spectrometry (MS);Neurological Diseases;Protein Conformation;Protein-DNA Interaction;Protein Folding;Protein Structure;MeCP2;Hydrogen Exchange

PRG is a multidomain protein composed of PDZ, regulators of G-protein signaling-like (RGSL), Dbl-homology (DH), and pleckstrin-homology (PH) domains. It is autoinhibited in cytosol and is believed to undergo a conformational rearrangement and translocation to the membrane for full activation, although the molecular details of the regulation mechanism are not clear. It has been shown recently that the main autoregulatory elements of PDZRhoGEF, the autoinhibitory “activation box” and the “GEF switch,” which is required for full activation, are located directly upstream of the catalytic DH domain and its RhoA binding surface, emphasizing the functional role of the RGSL-DH linker. Here, using a combination of biophysical and biochemical methods, we show that the mechanism of PRG regulation is yet more complex and may involve an additional autoinhibitory element in the form of a molten globule region within the linker between RGSL and DH domains. We propose a novel, two-tier model of autoinhibition where the activation box and the molten globule region act synergistically to impair the ability of RhoA to bind to the catalytic DH-PH tandem. The molten globule region and the activation box become less ordered in the PRG-RhoA complex and dissociate from the RhoA-binding site, which may constitute a critical step leading to PRG activation.",Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF);Intrinsically Disordered Proteins;Protein Dynamics;Protein Structure;X-ray Scattering

The N-terminal region (NTR) of E1 is essential for DNA replication in vivo but dispensable in vitro, suggesting that it has a regulatory function. By deletion analysis, we identified a conserved region of the E1 NTR needed for efficient replication of viral DNA. This region is predicted to form an amphipathic α-helix (AH) and shows sequence similarity to portions of the p53 and herpes simplex virus (HSV) VP16 transactivation domains known as transactivation domain 2 (TAD2) and VP16C, which fold into α-helices upon binding their target proteins, including the Tfb1/p62 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae/human) subunit of general transcription factor TFIIH. By nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we found that a peptide spanning the E1 AH binds Tfb1 on the same surface as TAD2/VP16C and with a comparable affinity, suggesting that it does bind as an α-helix. Furthermore, the E1 NTRs from several human papillomavirus (HPV) types could activate transcription in yeast, and to a lesser extent in mammalian cells, when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain. Mutation of the three conserved hydrophobic residues in the E1 AH, analogous to those in TAD2/VP16C that directly contact their target proteins, decreased transactivation activity and, importantly, also reduced by 50% the ability of E1 to support transient replication of DNA in C33A cells, at a step following assembly of the E1-E2-ori preinitiation complex. These results demonstrate the existence of a conserved TAD2/VP16C-like AH in E1 that is required for efficient replication of viral DNA.",

Recently we demonstrated a critical role for the 17 amino acid N-terminal segment (httNT) of huntingtin (htt) in oligomer-mediated amyloid assembly of htt N-terminal fragments. In this mechanism, the httNT segment forms the α-helix rich core of the oligomers, leaving most or all of each polyglutamine (polyQ) segment disordered and solvent-exposed. Nucleation of amyloid structure occurs within this local high concentration of disordered polyQ. Here we demonstrate the kinetic importance of httNT self-assembly by describing inhibitory httNT-containing peptides that appear to work by targeting nucleation within the oligomer fraction. These molecules inhibit amyloid nucleation by forming mixed oligomers with the httNT domains of polyQ-containing htt N-terminal fragments. In one class of inhibitor, nucleation is passively suppressed due to the reduced local concentration of polyQ within the mixed oligomer. In the other class, nucleation is actively suppressed by a proline-rich polyQ segment covalently attached to httNT. Studies with D-amino acid and scrambled sequence versions of httNT suggest that inhibition activity is strongly linked to the propensity of inhibitory peptides to make amphipathic α-helices. HttNT derivatives with C-terminal cell penetrating peptide segments, also exhibit excellent inhibitory activity. The httNT-based peptides described here, especially those with protease-resistant D-amino acids and/or with cell penetrating sequences, may prove useful as lead therapeutics for inhibiting nucleation of amyloid formation in Huntington’s disease.",amyloid;polyglutamine;inhibitor;α-helical intermediate;cell penetrating peptide

Herein, using a myriad of biophysical techniques, we provide evidence that ligand binding and membrane insertion compete with oligomerization of BclXL in solution. Of particular importance is the observation that such oligomerization is driven by the intermolecular binding of its C-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain to the canonical hydrophobic groove in a domain-swapped trans-fashion, whereby the TM domain of one monomer occupies the canonical hydrophobic groove within the other monomer and vice versa. Binding of BH3 ligands to the canonical hydrophobic groove displaces the TM domain in a competitive manner allowing BclXL to dissociate into monomers upon hetero-association. Remarkably, spontaneous insertion of BclXL into DMPC/DHPC bicelles results in a dramatic conformational change such that it can no longer recognize the BH3 ligands in what has come to be known as the “hit-and-run” mechanism. Collectively, our data suggest that oligomerization of a key apoptotic repressor serves as an allosteric switch that fine tunes its ligand binding and membrane insertion pertinent to the regulation of apoptotic machinery.",BclXL apoptotic repressor;Protein oligomerization;Ligand binding;Membrane insertion;Allosteric regulation

In previous work a model Hsp90 substrate revealed an activation process in which substrate binding accelerates a large open/closed conformational change required for ATP hydrolysis by Hsp90. While this could serve as an elegant mechanism for conserving ATP usage for productive interactions on the substrate, the structural origin of substrate catalyzed Hsp90 conformational changes are unknown. Here we find that substrate binding affects an intrinsically unfavorable rotation of the Hsp90 N-terminal domain (NTD) relative to the middle domain (MD) that is required for closure. We identify an MD substrate binding region on the interior cleft of the Hsp90 dimer and show that a secondary set of substrate contacts drive an NTD orientation change on the opposite monomer. These results suggest an Hsp90 activation mechanism in which cross-monomer contacts mediated by a partially structured substrate prime the chaperone for its functional activity.",

However, here we show that the non-pathogenic murine SAA2.2 spontaneously forms marginally stable amyloid fibrils at 37 °C that exhibit cross-beta structure, binding to thioflavin T, and fibrillation by a nucleation-dependent seeding mechanism. In contrast to the high stability of most known amyloid fibrils to thermal and chemical denaturation, experiments monitored by glutaraldehyde cross-linking/SDS-PAGE, thioflavin T fluorescence, and light scattering (OD600) showed that the mature amyloid fibrils of SAA2.2 dissociate upon incubation in > 1.0 M urea or > 45 °C. When considering the non-pathogenic nature of SAA2.2 and its ~1000-fold increased concentration in plasma during an inflammatory response, its extreme in vitro amyloidogenicity under physiological-like conditions suggest that SAA amyloid might play a functional role during inflammation. Of general significance, the combination of methods used here are convenient for exploring the stability of amyloid fibrils that are sensitive to urea and temperature. Furthermore, our studies imply that analogous to globular proteins, which can possess structures ranging from intrinsically disordered to extremely stable, amyloid fibrils formed in vivo might have a broader range of stabilities than previously appreciated with profound functional and pathological implications",serum amyloid A;intrinsically disordered;protein folding;amyloid stability;reactive amyloidosis;acute phase reaction

Although it is known from a crystal structure of partial molecules that the PDEγ C terminus contacts with both αt and RGS9, contributions from the intrinsically disordered PDEγ N-terminal half remain unclear. In this study, we were able to investigate this issue using a photolabel transfer strategy that allows for mapping the interface of full-length proteins. We observed label transfer from PDEγ N-terminal positions 50, 30, and 16 to RGS9·β5 in the GTPase-accelerating protein (GAP) complex composed of PDEγ·αt·RGS9·β5. In support of a direct PDEγ N-terminal interaction with RGS9·β5, the PDEγ N-terminal peptide PDEγ(1–61) abolished label transfer to RGS9·β5, and another N-terminal peptide, PDEγ(10–30), disassembled the GAP complex in label transfer and pulldown experiments. Furthermore, we determined that the PDEγ C-terminal interaction with αt was enhanced whereas the N-terminal interaction was weakened upon changing the αt conformation from the signaling state to the transition state. This “rearrangement” of PDEγ domain interactions with αt appears to facilitate the interaction of the PDEγ N-terminal half with RGS9·β5 and hence its contribution to optimal stabilization of the GAP complex.",G Proteins;Phosphodiesterases;Phototransduction;Protein Conformation;Protein-Protein interactions;G Protein β5-Subunit;GTPase-accelerating Proteins;PDE6γ;Regulator of G Protein Signaling;Transition State Complex

Its conversion to a double stranded minicircle precedes the second insertional step, where both ends function as donors. In IS2, the left end which lacks donor function in Step I acquires it in Step II. The assembly of two intrinsically different protein-DNA complexes in these F-8 generating elements has been intuitively proposed, but a barrier to testing this hypothesis has been the difficulty of isolating a full length, soluble and active transposase that creates fully formed synaptic complexes in vitro with protein bound to both binding and catalytic domains of the ends.

REs (regulatory elements) are often far from transcription start sites. In the present review we discuss possible mechanisms to explain how information from specific REs is conveyed to the basal transcription machinery through TFs (transcription factors) and the Mediator complex. We hypothesize that this occurs through allosteric pathways: binding of a TF to a RE results in changes in the AD (activation domain) of the TF, which binds to Mediator and alters the distribution of the Mediator conformations, thereby affecting transcription initiation/activation. We argue that Mediator is formed by highly disordered proteins with large densely packed interfaces that make efficient long-range signal propagation possible. We suggest two possible general mechanisms for Mediator action: one in which Mediator influences PIC (pre-initiation complex) assembly and transcription initiation, and another in which Mediator exerts its effect on the already assembled but stalled transcription complex. We summarize (i) relevant information from the literature about Mediator composition, organization and structure; (ii) Mediator interaction partners and their effect on Mediator conformation, function and correlation to the RNA Pol II (polymerase II) CTD (C-terminal domain) phosphorylation; and (iii) propose that different allosteric signal propagation pathways in Mediator relate to PIC assembly and polymerase activation of the stalled transcription complex. The emerging picture provides for the first time a mechanistic view of allosteric signalling from the RE sequence to transcription activation, and an insight into how gene specificity and signal transmission can take place in transcription initiation.",allosteric pathway;allosteric propagation;allostery;enhancer;mediator;transcription initiation;transcription regulation;transcription start site

Apicoplast precursor proteins are synthesized at the rough endoplasmic reticulum, but are then specifically sorted from other proteins in the secretory pathway. The mechanism of TP recognition is presently unknown. Apicoplast TPs do not contain a conserved sequence motif; therefore, we asked whether they contain an essential structural motif. Using nuclear magnetic resonance to study a model TP from acyl carrier protein, we found a short, low-occupancy helix, but the TP was otherwise disordered. Using an in vivo localization assay, we blocked TP secondary structure by proline mutagenesis, but found robust apicoplast localization. Alternatively, we increased the helical content of the TP through mutation while maintaining established TP characteristics. Apicoplast import was disrupted in a helical mutant TP, but import was then restored by the further addition of a single proline. We conclude that structure in the TP interferes with apicoplast import, and therefore TPs are functionally disordered.

As a consequence, several cytoskeleton-interacting proteins become involved in a variety of cellular processes such as cell growth and division, cell movement, vesicle transportation, cellular organelle location and function, localization and distribution of membrane receptors, and cell-cell communication. Molecular chaperones and immunophilins are counted among the most important proteins that interact closely with the cytoskeleton network, in particular with microtubules and microtubule-associated factors. In several situations, heat-shock proteins and immunophilins work together as a functionally active heterocomplex, although both types of proteins also show independent actions. In circumstances where homeostasis is affected by environmental stresses or due to genetic alterations, chaperone proteins help to stabilize the system. Molecular chaperones facilitate the assembly, disassembly and/or folding/refolding of cytoskeletal proteins, so they prevent aberrant protein aggregation. Nonetheless, the roles of heat-shock proteins and immunophilins are not limited to solve abnormal situations, but they also have an active participation during the normal differentiation process of the cell and are key factors for many structural and functional rearrangements during this course of action. Cytoskeleton modifications leading to altered localization of nuclear factors may result in loss- or gain-of-function of such factors, which affects the cell cycle and cell development. Therefore, cytoskeletal components are attractive therapeutic targets, particularly microtubules, to prevent pathological situations such as rapidly dividing tumour cells or to favor the process of cell differentiation in other cases. In this review we will address some classical and novel aspects of key regulatory functions of heat-shock proteins and immunophilins as housekeeping factors of the cytoskeletal network.",Heat-shock protein;Microtubule;Microfilament;Intermediate Filament;Stress;Folding

We have discovered that a class of systematically designed natural tri- to hexapeptides with a characteristic sequential motif can simulate the process of fiber assembly and further condensation to amyloid fibrils, probably via unexpected dimeric α-helical intermediate structures. The characteristic sequence motif of the novel peptide class consists of an aliphatic amino acid tail of decreasing hydrophobicity capped by a polar head. To our knowledge, the investigated aliphatic tripeptides are the shortest ever reported naturally occurring amino acid sequence that can adopt α-helical structure and promote amyloid formation. We propose the stepwise assembly process to be associated with characteristic conformational changes from random coil to α-helical intermediates terminating in cross-β peptide structures. Circular dichroism and X-ray fiber diffraction analyses confirmed the concentration-dependent conformational changes of the peptides in water. Molecular dynamics simulating peptide behavior in water revealed monomer antiparallel pairing to dimer structures by complementary structural alignment that further aggregated and stably condensed into coiled fibers. The ultrasmall size and the dynamic facile assembly process make this novel peptide class an excellent model system for studying the mechanism of amyloidogenesis, its evolution and pathogenicity. The ability to modify the properties of the assembled structures under defined conditions will shed light on strategies to manipulate the pathogenic amyloid aggregates in order to prevent or control aggregate formation.",self-assembly mechanism;ultrasmall peptides;supramolecular peptide scaffolds;fiber diffraction;molecular dynamics simulation

Dynactin targets dynein to specific cellular locations, links dynein to cargo, and increases dynein processivity. These two macromolecular complexes are connected by a direct interaction between dynactin's largest subunit, p150Glued, and dynein intermediate chain (IC) subunit. Here, we demonstrate using NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry that the binding footprint of p150Glued on IC involves two noncontiguous recognition regions, and both are required for full binding affinity. In apo-IC, the helical structure of region 1, the nascent helix of region 2, and the disorder in the rest of the chain are determined from coupling constants, amide-amide sequential NOEs, secondary chemical shifts, and various dynamics measurements. When bound to p150Glued, different patterns of spectral exchange broadening suggest that region 1 forms a coiled-coil and region 2 a packed stable helix, with the intervening residues remaining disordered. In the 150-kDa complex of p150Glued, IC, and two light chains, the noninterface segments remain disordered. The multiregion IC binding interface, the partial disorder of region 2 and its potential for post-translational modification, and the modulation of the length of the longer linker by alternative splicing may provide a basis for elegant and multifaceted regulation of binding between IC and p150Glued.

Empirical demonstrations that these traits promote evolvability in nature remain scant however. This is in part because modularity, robustness, and evolvability are difficult to define and measure in real biological systems. Here, we address whether structural modularity and/or robustness confer evolvability at the level of proteins by looking for associations between indices of protein structural modularity, structural robustness, and evolvability. We propose a novel index for protein structural modularity: the number of regular secondary structure elements (helices and strands) divided by the number of residues in the structure. We index protein evolvability as the proportion of sites with evidence of being under positive selection multiplied by the average rate of adaptive evolution at these sites, and we measure this as an average over a phylogeny of 25 mammalian species. We use contact density as an index of protein designability, and thus, structural robustness. We find that protein evolvability is positively associated with structural modularity as well as structural robustness and that the effect of structural modularity on evolvability is independent of the structural robustness index. We interpret these associations to be the result of reduced constraints on amino acid substitutions in highly modular and robust protein structures, which results in faster adaptation through natural selection.",modularity;designability;contact density;evolvability;protein evolution;robustness

Low-resolution studies based on proteolysis established that the recombinant calponin fragment 131–228 contained actin and calmodulin recognition sites but failed to precisely identify the actin-binding determinants. In this study, we used NMR spectroscopy to investigate the structure of this functionally important region of calponin and map its interaction with actin and calmodulin at amino-acid resolution. Our data indicates that the free calponin peptide is largely unstructured in solution, although four short amino-acid stretches corresponding to residues 140–146, 159–165, 189–195, and 199–205 display the propensity to form α-helices. The presence of four sequential transient helices probably provides the conformational malleability needed for the promiscuous nature of this region of calponin. We identified all amino acids involved in actin binding and demonstrated for the first time, to our knowledge, that the N-terminal flanking region of Lys137-Tyr144 is an integral part of the actin-binding site. We have also delineated the second actin-binding site to amino acids Thr180-Asp190. Ca2+-calmodulin binding extends beyond the previously identified minimal sequence of 153–163 and includes most amino acids within the stretch 143–165. In addition, we found that calmodulin induces chemical shift perturbations of amino acids 188–190 demonstrating for the first time, to our knowledge, an effect of Ca2+-calmodulin on this region. The spatial relationship of the actin and calmodulin contacts as well as the transient α-helical structures within the regulatory region of calponin provides a structural framework for understanding the Ca2+-dependent regulation of the actin-calponin interaction by calmodulin.",

The viral transmembrane glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are intrinsically targeted to these domains, while M2 is seemingly targeted to the edge of the budozone. Virus assembly is orchestrated by the matrix protein M1, binding to all viral components and the membrane. Budding progresses by protein- and lipid-mediated membrane bending and particle scission probably mediated by M2. Here, we summarize the experimental evidence for this model with emphasis on the raft-targeting features of HA, NA, and M2 and review the functional importance of raft domains for viral protein transport, assembly and budding, environmental stability, and membrane fusion.",

For example, the mapping of 3D-structural data onto networks enables classification of proteins into singlish- or multi-interface hubs (depending on whether they have >2 interfaces). Similarly, interactions can be classified as permanent or transient, depending on whether their interface is used by only one or by multiple partners. Here, we incorporate an additional dimension into molecular networks: dynamic conformational changes. We parse the entire PDB structural databank for alternate conformations of proteins and map these onto the protein interaction network, to compile a first version of the Dynamic Structural Interaction Network (DynaSIN). We make this network available as a readily downloadable resource file, and we then use it to address a variety of downstream questions. In particular, we show that multi-interface hubs display a greater degree of conformational change than do singlish-interface ones; thus, they show more plasticity which perhaps enables them to utilize more interfaces for interactions. We also find that transient associations involve smaller conformational changes than permanent ones. Although this may appear counterintuitive, it is understandable in the following framework: as proteins involved in transient interactions shuttle between interchangeable associations, they interact with domains that are similar to each other and so do not require drastic structural changes for their activity. We provide evidence for this hypothesis through showing that interfaces involved in transient interactions bind fewer classes of domains than those in a control set.",protein structural changes;protein interactions;transient and permanent interactions;interface

The evolutionary and physical mechanisms of oligomerization are very diverse and its general principles have not yet been formulated. Homooligomeric states may be conserved within certain protein subfamilies and might be important in providing specificity to certain substrates while minimizing interactions with other unwanted partners. Moreover, recent studies have led to a greater awareness that transitions between different oligomeric states may regulate protein activity and provide the switch between different pathways. In this review we summarize the biological importance of homooligomeric assemblies, physico-chemical properties of their interfaces, experimental and computational methods for their identification and prediction. We particularly focus on homooligomer evolution and describe the mechanisms to develop new specificities through the formation of different homooligomeric complexes. Finally, we discuss the possible role of oligomeric transitions in the regulation of protein activity and compile a set of experimental examples with such regulatory mechanisms.",

Tau pathologically aggregates in neurons, a process that is closely linked with cognitive deficits in AD. Tau typically functions to stabilize and bundle MTs. Cellular events like calcium influx destabilize MTs, disengaging tau. This excess tau should be degraded, but sometimes it is stabilized and forms higher-order aggregates, a pathogenic hallmark of tauopathies. FKBP51 was also found to increase in forebrain neurons with age, further supporting a novel role for FKBP51 in tau processing. This, combined with compelling evidence that the prolyl isomerase Pin1 regulates tau stability and phosphorylation dynamics, suggests an emerging role for isomerization in tau pathogenesis.",

Notably, carbonylation increases with the age of cells and is associated with the formation of intracellular protein aggregates and the pathogenesis of age-related disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. However, it is still largely unclear how carbonylation affects protein structure, dynamics, and aggregability at the atomic level. Here, we use classical molecular dynamics simulations to study structure and dynamics of the carbonylated headpiece domain of villin, a key actin-organizing protein. We perform an exhaustive set of molecular dynamics simulations of a native villin headpiece together with every possible combination of carbonylated versions of its seven lysine, arginine, and proline residues, quantitatively the most important carbonylable amino acids. Surprisingly, our results suggest that high levels of carbonylation, far above those associated with cell death in vivo, may be required to destabilize and unfold protein structure through the disruption of specific stabilizing elements, such as salt bridges or proline kinks, or tampering with the hydrophobic effect. On the other hand, by using thermodynamic integration and molecular hydrophobicity potential approaches, we quantitatively show that carbonylation of hydrophilic lysine and arginine residues is equivalent to introducing hydrophobic, charge-neutral mutations in their place, and, by comparison with experimental results, we demonstrate that this by itself significantly increases the intrinsic aggregation propensity of both structured, native proteins and their unfolded states. Finally, our results provide a foundation for a novel experimental strategy to study the effects of carbonylation on protein structure, dynamics, and aggregability using site-directed mutagenesis.",

Our group has previously shown that this domain presents conformational changes in a non-lipid environment when the mutation D470N is introduced. Using a series of peptides derived from this C-terminal domain, the present study shows that these changes favor the induction of a secondary β-structure as characterized by spectroscopic analysis and fluorescence techniques. From this type of secondary structure, the formation of peptide aggregates and fibrillar structures with amyloid characteristics induced cytotoxicity in microglial cells in culture. These supramolecular structures promote cell cytotoxicity through the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and change the balance of a series of proteins that control the process of endocytosis, similar to that observed when β-amyloid fibrils are employed. Therefore, a fine balance between the highly dynamic secondary structure of the C-terminal domain of CETP, the net charge, and the physicochemical characteristics of the surrounding microenvironment define the type of secondary structure acquired. Changes in this balance might favor misfolding in this region, which would alter the lipid transfer capacity conducted by CETP, favoring its propensity to substitute its physiological function.",cholesteryl-ester transfer protein (CETP);CETP C-terminal domain;α-helix and β-sheet secondary structures;peptide oligomers;amyloids

The normal function of synucleins is poorly understood, but appears to involve membrane interactions, and in particular reversible binding to synaptic vesicle membranes. Structural studies of different states of alpha-synuclein, in the absence and presence of membranes or membrane mimetics, have led to models of how membrane-bound forms of the protein may contribute both to functional properties of the protein, as well as to membrane-induced self-assembly and aggregation.

The activation mechanism of ClpP using acyldepsipeptide antibiotics as mimics of natural activators showed enlargement of the axial entrance pore for easier processing of incoming substrates. However, the elimination of degradation products from inside the ClpP chamber remains unclear since there is no exit pore for releasing these products in all determined ClpP structures. Here we report a new crystal structure of ClpP from Bacillus subtilis, which shows a significantly compressed shape along the axial direction. A portion of the handle regions comprising the heptameric ring-ring contacts shows structural transition from an ordered to a disordered state, which triggers the large conformational change from an extended to an overall compressed structure. Along with this structural change, 14 side pores are generated for product release and the catalytic triad adopts an inactive orientation. We have also determined B. subtilis ClpP inhibited by diisopropylfluoro-phosphate and analyzed the active site in detail. Structural information pertaining to several different conformational steps such as those related to extended, ADEP-activated, DFP-inhibited and compressed forms of ClpP from B. subtilis is available. Structural comparisons suggest that functionally important regions in the ClpP-family such as N-terminal segments for the axial pore, catalytic triads, and handle domains for the product releasing pore exhibit intrinsically dynamic and unique structural features.

Canonical signaling results in changes in gene expression, which is regulated by the nuclear effector of the pathway CSL (CBF1/RBP-J, Su(H), Lag-1). CSL is a DNA binding protein that functions as either a repressor or an activator of transcription, depending upon whether it is complexed by transcriptional corepressor or coactivator proteins, respectively. In stark contrast to CSL-coactivator complexes, e.g. the transcriptionally active CSL-Notch-Mastermind ternary complex, the structure and function of CSL-corepressor complexes are poorly understood. The corepressor MINT (Msx2-interacting nuclear target protein) has been shown in vivo to antagonize Notch signaling and shown in vitro to biochemically interact with CSL; however, the molecular details of this interaction are only partially defined. Here, we provide a quantitative thermodynamic binding analysis of CSL-MINT complexes. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we demonstrate that MINT forms a high affinity complex with CSL, and we also delineate the domains of MINT and CSL that are necessary and sufficient for complex formation. Moreover, we show in cultured cells that this region of MINT can inhibit Notch signaling in transcriptional reporter assays. Taken together, our results provide functional insights into how CSL is converted from a repressor to an activator of transcription.",Calorimetry;Corepressor Transcription;Crystal Structure;Notch Pathway;Protein-protein Interactions;Signal Transduction;Transcription Factors

Knowledge of these characteristics can provide valuable guidelines in the design of novel heme proteins and help us predict unknown heme binding proteins.,

However, the precise molecular mechanism(s) by which GAGs accelerate amyloidogenesis remains elusive. Herein, we show that sulfated GAGs, especially heparin, accelerate transthyretin (TTR) amyloidogenesis by quaternary structural conversion. The clustering of sulfate groups on heparin and its polymeric nature are essential features for accelerating TTR amyloidogenesis. Heparin does not influence TTR tetramer stability or TTR dissociation kinetics, nor does it alter the folded monomer – misfolded monomer equilibrium directly. Instead, heparin accelerates the conversion of preformed TTR oligomers into larger aggregates. The more rapid disappearance of monomeric TTR in the presence of heparin likely reflects the fact that the monomer–misfolded amyloidogenic monomer–oligomer–TTR fibril equilibria are all linked—a hypothesis that is strongly supported by the light scattering data. TTR aggregates prepared in presence of heparin showed a higher resistance to trypsin and proteinase K proteolysis and a lower exposure of hydrophobic side chains comprising hydrophobic clusters, suggesting an active role in amyloidogenesis. Our data suggest that heparin accelerates TTR aggregation by a scaffold-based mechanism, in which the sulfate groups comprising GAGs interact primarily with TTR oligomers through electrostatic interactions, concentrating and orienting the oligomers, facilitating the formation of higher molecular weight aggregates. This model raises the possibility that GAGs may play a protective role in human amyloid diseases by interacting with proteotoxic oligomers and promoting their association into less toxic amyloid fibrils.",

Efb (the extracellular fibrinogen-binding protein) is a secreted Staphylococcus aureus protein that engages host Fg and complement C3. However, the molecular details underlying the Efb-Fg interaction and the biological relevance of this interaction have not been determined. In the present study, we characterize the interaction of Efb with Fg. We demonstrate that the Fg binding activity is located within the intrinsically disordered N-terminal half of Efb (Efb-N) and that the D fragment of Fg is the region that mediates Efb-N binding. More detailed studies of the Efb-N-Fg interactions using ELISA and surface plasmon resonance analyses revealed that Efb-N exhibits a much higher affinity for Fg than typically observed with Fg-binding MSCRAMMs (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules), and data obtained from ELISA analyses using truncated Efb-N constructs demonstrate that Efb-N contains two binding sites located within residues 30–67 and 68–98, respectively. Efb-N inhibits neutrophil adhesion to immobilized Fg by binding to Fg and blocking the interaction of the protein with the leukocyte integrin receptor, αMβ2. A motif in the Fg γ chain previously shown to be central to the αMβ2 interaction was shown to be functionally distinguishable from the Efb-N binding site, suggesting that the Fg-Efb interaction indirectly impedes Fg engagement by αMβ2. Taken together, these studies provide insights into how Efb interacts with Fg and suggest that Efb may support bacterial virulence at least in part by impeding Fg-driven leukocyte adhesion events.",Adhesion;Bacteria;Fibrinogen;Innate Immunity;Neutrophil;Bacterial Infection;Integrin;Protein-Protein Interaction;Secreted Bacteria Proteins

The II-III loop has been previously examined in vitro using a linear II-III loop with unrestrained N- and C-terminal ends. To better reproduce the loop structure in its native environment (tethered to the DHPR transmembrane domains), we have joined the N and C termini using intein-mediated technology. Circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy revealed a structural shift in the cyclized loop toward a protein with increased α-helical and β-strand structure in a region of the loop implicated in its in vitro function and also in a critical region for EC coupling. The affinity of binding of the II-III loop binding to the SPRY2 domain of the skeletal ryanodine receptor (RyR1) increased 4-fold, and its ability to activate RyR1 channels in lipid bilayers was enhanced 3-fold by cyclization. These functional changes were predicted consequences of the structural enhancement.

To whom correspondence should be addressed: ude.nmu@namrebj","The Dam1 complex attaches the kinetochore to spindle microtubules and is a processivity factor in vitro [1, 2]. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has point centromeres that attach to a single microtubule, deletion of any Dam1 complex member results in chromosome segregation failures and cell death [3–5]. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which has epigenetically-defined regional centromeres that each attach to 3–5 kinetochore microtubules, Dam1 complex homologs are not essential [6]. To ask why the complex is essential in some organisms and not in others, we used Candida albicans, a multimorphic yeast with regional centromeres that attach to a single microtubule [7]. Interestingly, the Dam1 complex was essential in C. albicans, suggesting that the number of microtubules per centromere is critical for its requirement. Importantly, by increasing CENP-A expression levels, more kinetochore proteins and microtubules were recruited to the centromeres, which remained fully functional. Furthermore, Dam1 complex members became less crucial for growth in cells with extra kinetochore proteins and microtubules. Thus, the requirement for the Dam1 complex is not due to the DNA-specific nature of point centromeres. Rather, the Dam1 complex is less critical when chromosomes have multiple kinetochore complexes and microtubules per centromere, implying that it functions as a processivity factor in vivo as well as in vitro.",

Gibberellin induces degradation of DELLA proteins by recruitment of an F-box protein using a molecular switch: a gibberellin-bound nuclear receptor interacts with the N-terminal domain of DELLA proteins, and this event primes the DELLA C-terminal domain for interaction with the F-box protein. However, the mechanism of signalling between the N- and C-terminal domains of DELLA proteins is unresolved. In the present study, we used in vivo and in vitro approaches to characterize di- and tri-partite interactions of the DELLA protein RGL1 (REPRESSOR OF GA1-3-LIKE 1) of Arabidopsis thaliana with the gibberellin receptor GID1A (GIBBERELLIC ACID-INSENSITIVE DWARF-1A) and the F-box protein SLY1 (SLEEPY1). Deuterium-exchange MS unequivocally showed that the entire N-terminal domain of RGL1 is disordered prior to interaction with the GID1A; furthermore, association/dissociation kinetics, determined by surface plasmon resonance, predicts a two-state conformational change of the RGL1 N-terminal domain upon interaction with GID1A. Additionally, competition assays with monoclonal antibodies revealed that contacts mediated by the short helix Asp-Glu-Leu-Leu of the hallmark DELLA motif are not essential for the GID1A–RGL1 N-terminal domain interaction. Finally, yeast two- and three-hybrid experiments determined that unabated communication between N- and C-terminal domains of RGL1 is required for recruitment of the F-box protein SLY1.",Arabidopsis thaliana;DELLA protein;F-box protein;gibberellin;GIBBERELLIC ACID-INSENSITIVE DWARF-1A (GID1A);SLEEPY1 (SLY1)

Simocyclinone is exported by a specific efflux pump, SimX and the transcription of simX is repressed by SimR, which binds to two operators in the simR-simX intergenic region. The DNA-binding domain of SimR has a classical helix-turn-helix motif, but it also carries an arginine-rich N-terminal extension. Previous structural studies showed that the N-terminal extension is disordered in the absence of DNA. Here, we show that the N-terminal extension is sensitive to protease cleavage, but becomes protease resistant upon binding DNA. We demonstrate by deletion analysis that the extension contributes to DNA binding, and describe the crystal structure of SimR bound to its operator sequence, revealing that the N-terminal extension binds in the minor groove. In addition, SimR makes a number of sequence-specific contacts to the major groove via its helix-turn-helix motif. Bioinformatic analysis shows that an N-terminal extension rich in positively charged residues is a feature of the majority of TFRs. Comparison of the SimR–DNA and SimR–simocyclinone complexes reveals that the conformational changes associated with ligand-mediated derepression result primarily from rigid-body rotation of the subunits about the dimer interface.",

Here, we consider the Porod-Debye law as a powerful tool for detecting biopolymer flexibility in SAS experiments. We show that the Porod-Debye region fundamentally describes the nature of the scattering intensity decay, which captures information needed for distinguishing between folded and flexible particles. Particularly for comparative SAS experiments, application of the law, as described here, can distinguish between discrete conformational changes and localized flexibility relevant to molecular recognition and interaction networks. This approach aids insightful analyses of fully and partly flexible macromolecules that is more robust and conclusive than traditional Kratky analyses.

We tested the idea that volume exclusion dominates the crowding effect in cells with a variant of protein L, a 7-kDa globular protein with seven lysine residues replaced by glutamic acids. Eighty-four percent of the variant molecules populate the denatured state in dilute buffer at room temperature, compared to 0.1% for the wild-type protein. We then used in-cell nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to show that the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli does not overcome even this modest (~1 kcal/mol) free energy deficit. The data are consistent with the idea that non-specific interactions between cytoplasmic components can overcome the excluded volume effect. Evidence for these interactions is provided by the observation that adding simple salts folds the variant in dilute solution, but increasing the salt concentration inside E. coli does not fold the protein. Our data are consistent with other studies of protein stability in cells, and suggest that stabilizing excluded volume effects, which must be present under crowded conditions, can be ameliorated by non-specific interactions between cytoplasmic components.",

To understand the linewidth contributions to membrane protein NMR spectra, we have measured the inhomogeneous and homogeneous linewidths of several well-studied membrane peptides under immobilized conditions. 13C T2 relaxation times of uniformly 13C-labeled residues show that the homogeneous linewidths of the peptides are comparable to those of crystalline model compounds under identical 1H decoupling and magic-angle-spinning conditions, indicating that the homogeneous linewidths are determined by conformation-independent factors, including residual dipolar coupling, J coupling and intrinsic T2 relaxation. However, the membrane peptides exhibit larger apparent linewidths than the crystalline compounds, indicating conformational disorder. A cationic cell-penetrating peptide, the human immunodeficiency virus TAT, exhibits the largest apparent linewidths, which are about 5-fold larger than the homogeneous linewidths, while the transmembrane helix of the influenza M2 peptide and the β-hairpin antimicrobial peptide PG-1 show moderately larger apparent linewidths than the crystalline compounds. These results are consistent with the random coil nature of the TAT peptide, which contrasts with the intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded M2 and PG-1. Cross peak lineshapes of 2D double-quantum correlation spectra show that the conformational disorder can occur at the residue level and can result from three origins: lipid-peptide interaction, intrinsic conformational disorder encoded in the amino acid sequence, and sidechain rotameric averaging. A particularly important lipid-peptide interaction for cationic membrane peptides is guanidinium-phosphate ion pair interaction. Thus, NMR linewidths and lineshapes are useful for understanding the conformational disorder of membrane peptides and proteins.",

Selectivity has been difficult to achieve, especially for targets that belong to large families of structurally and functionally related proteins. There are essentially two ways [AU1] by which selectivity can be improved during lead optimization: a chemical modification of the lead compound that improves the affinity towards the target to a higher extent than to off-target molecules; and a chemical modification that lowers the affinity of the lead compound towards off-target molecules. Maximal selectivity is achieved when both mechanisms can be combined synergistically. As we discuss here, analysis of several protease inhibitors that vary in a single functionality indicates that nonpolar functionalities preferentially follow the first mechanism, whereas polar functionalities follow the second, and that those features are imprinted in their thermodynamic signatures.",

A highly selective barrier formed by the phenylalanine–glycine (FG)-nucleoporin (Nup) in the NPC allows for two transport modes: passive diffusion and transport receptor-facilitated translocation. Strict regulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport is crucial for cell survival, differentiation, growth and other essential activities. However, due to the limited knowledge of the native configuration of the FG-Nup barrier and the interactions between the transiting molecules and the barrier in the NPC, the precise nucleocytoplasmic transport mechanism remains unresolved. To refine the transport mechanism, single-molecule fluorescence microscopy methods have been employed to obtain the transport kinetics of individual fluorescent molecules through the NPC and to map the interactions between transiting molecules and the FG-Nup barrier. Important characteristics of nucleocytoplasmic transport, such as transport time, transport efficiency and spatial distribution of single transiting molecules in the NPC, have been obtained that could not be measured by either ensemble average methods or conventional electron microscopy. In this critical review, we discuss the development of various single-molecule techniques and their application to nucleocytoplasmic transport in vitro and in vivo. In particular, we highlight a recent advance from one-dimensional to three-dimensional single-molecule characterization of transport through the NPC and present a comprehensive understanding of the nucleocytoplasmic transport mechanism obtained by this new technical development (105 references).",

Multiplications of the αSynuclein gene, as well as point mutations cause familial PD. However, the exact role of αSynuclein in neurodegeneration remains uncertain. Recent research in invertebrates has suggested that oligomeric rather than fibrillizing αSynuclein mediates neurotoxicity. To investigate the impact of αSynuclein aggregation on the progression of neurodegeneration, we expressed variants with different fibrillation propensities in the rat substantia nigra (SN) by means of recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. The formation of proteinase K-resistant αSynuclein aggregates was correlated to the loss of nigral dopaminergic (DA) neurons and striatal fibers. Expression of two prefibrillar, structure-based design mutants of αSynuclein (i.e., A56P and A30P/A56P/A76P) resulted in less aggregate formation in nigral DA neurons as compared to human wild-type (WT) or the inherited A30P mutation. However, only the αSynuclein variants capable of forming fibrils (WT/A30P), but not the oligomeric αSynuclein species induced a sustained progressive loss of adult nigral DA neurons. These results demonstrate that divergent modes of αSynuclein neurotoxicity exist in invertebrate and mammalian DA neurons in vivo and suggest that fibrillation of αSynuclein promotes the progressive degeneration of nigral DA neurons as found in PD patients.",αSynuclein;Parkinson’s disease;Aggregation;Adeno-associated virus;Substantia nigra

Contradicting this assumption, we present stopped-flow fluorescence and NMR experiments that give unequivocal evidence for the presence of a ternary DNA–NF-κB–IκBα complex in solution. Stepwise addition of a DNA fragment containing the κB binding sequence to the IκBα–NF-κB complex results in changes in the IκBα NMR spectrum that are consistent with dissociation of the region rich in proline, glutamate, serine, and threonine (PEST) and C-terminal ankyrin repeat sequences of IκBα from the complex. However, even at high concentrations of DNA, IκBα remains associated with NF-κB, indicated by the absence of resonances of the free N-terminal ankyrin repeats of IκBα. The IκBα-mediated release of NF-κB from its DNA-bound state may be envisioned as the reverse of this process. The initial step would consist of the coupled folding and binding of the intrinsically disordered nuclear localization sequence of the p65 subunit of NF-κB to the well-structured N-terminal ankyrin repeats of IκBα. Subsequently the poorly folded C-terminal ankyrin repeats of IκBα would fold upon binding to the p50 and p65 dimerization domains of NF-κB, permitting the negatively charged C-terminal PEST sequence of IκBα to displace the bound DNA through a process of local mass action.",signal transduction;transcription factor

They accumulate typically in maturing seeds or are induced in vegetative tissues following salinity, dehydration, cold and freezing stress. The generally accepted classification of dehydrins is based on their structural features, such as the presence of conserved sequences, designated as Y, S and K segments. The K segment representing a highly conserved 15 amino acid motif forming amphiphilic a-helix is especially important since it has been found in all dehydrins. Since more than 20 y, they are thought to play an important protective role during cellular dehydration but their precise function remains unclear.

The new model is a flexible implementation of the composition-space refinement of interfacial structures to constrain the resulting scattering length density profiles. We show this model increases the precision with which molecular components may be localized within a sample, with a minimal use of free model parameters. We validate the new model by parameterizing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of bilayers and by evaluating the neutron reflectivity of a phospholipid bilayer physisorbed to a solid support. The determination of the structural arrangement of a sparsely-tethered bilayer lipid membrane (stBLM) comprised of a multi-component phospholipid bilayer anchored to a gold substrate by a thiolated oligo(ethylene oxide) linker is also demonstrated. From the model we extract the bilayer composition and density of tether points, information which was previously inaccessible for stBLM systems.

Thus, they will never reach the cell nucleus or the perinuclear areas where replication or reverse transcription usually takes place. It has been proposed that many unrelated viruses are transported along microtubules in a retrograde manner using the cellular dynein machinery or, at least, some dynein components. A putative employment of the dynein motor in a dynein‐mediated transport has been suggested from experiments in which viral capsid proteins were used as bait in yeast two‐hybrid screens using libraries composed of cellular proteins and dynein‐associated chains were retrieved as virus‐interacting proteins. In most cases DYNLL1, DYNLT1 or DYNLRB1 were identified as the dynein chains that interact with viral proteins. The importance of these dynein–virus interactions has been supported, in principle, by the observation that in some cases the dynein‐interacting motifs of viral proteins altered by site‐directed mutagenesis result in non‐infective virions. Furthermore, overexpression of p50 dynamitin, which blocks the dynein–dynactin interaction, or incubation of infected cells with peptides that compete with viral polypeptides for dynein binding have been shown to alter the viral retrograde transport. Still, it remains to be proved that dynein light chains can bind simultaneously to incoming virions and to the dynein motor for retrograde transport to take place.

","RTA1-33/44-198 is a catalytically inactive, single-domain derivative of the ricin toxin A-chain (RTA) engineered to serve as a stable protein scaffold for presentation of native immunogenic epitopes (Olson, et al., Protein Eng Des Sel 2004 17:391-7). To improve the stability and solubility of RTA1-33/44-198 further, we have undertaken the design challenge of introducing a disulfide (SS) bond. Nine pairs of residues were selected for placement of the SS-bond based on molecular dynamics simulation studies of the modeled single-domain chain. Disulfide formation at either of two positions (R48C/T77C or V49C/E99C) involving a specific surface loop (44-55) increased the protein melting temperature by ~5°C compared with RTA1-33/44-198 and by ~13°C compared with RTA. Prolonged stability studies of the R48C/T77C variant (>60 day at 37°C, pH 7.4) confirmed a >40% reduction in self-aggregation compared with RTA1-33/44-198 lacking the SS-bond. The R48C/T77C variant retained affinity for anti-RTA antibodies capable of neutralizing ricin toxin, including a monoclonal that recognizes a human B-cell epitope. Introduction of either R48C/T77C or V49C/E99C promoted crystallization of RTA1-33/44-198, and the X-ray structures of the variants were solved to 2.3Å or 2.1Å resolution, respectively. The structures confirm formation of an intramolecular SS-bond, and reveal a single-domain fold that is significantly reduced in volume compared with RTA. Loop 44-55 is partly disordered as predicted by simulations, and is positioned to form self-self interactions between symmetry-related molecules. We discuss the importance of RTA loop 34-55 as a nucleus for unfolding and aggregation, and draw conclusions for ongoing structure-based minimalist design of RTA-based immunogens.",aggregation;unfolding;subunit vaccine;toxin;protein engineering;crystal packing

With the increasing availability of protein structure complexes, it is highly important to devise strategies exploiting homologous structure space on a large scale for discovering putative PPIs that could be attractive drug targets. Here, we propose a scheme that allows performing large-scale screening of all protein complexes and finding putative small-molecule and/or peptide binding sites overlapping with protein–protein binding sites (so-called “multibinding sites”). We find more than 600 nonredundant proteins from 60 protein families with multibinding sites. Moreover, we show that the multibinding sites are mostly observed in transient complexes, largely overlap with the binding hotspots and are more evolutionarily conserved than other interface sites.

The activated signaling pathways show sustained and marked hyperphosphorylation, revealing a feedback circuit that is sensitive to basal signaling activity and is capable of adapting to changes in basal signal transduction machinery. We identify the inhibitory adaptor molecule Dok-1 as a candidate in the adaptive response to alterations in basal signaling activity. Our results also suggest a novel role for Csk in terminating or dampening of TCR signals.",

Phosphorylation of the receptor's ligand-binding domain at serine 273 has been shown to change the expression of a large number of genes implicated in obesity. The difference in gene expression seen when comparing wild-type phosphorylated with mutant non-phosphorylated PPARγ may have important consequences for the cellular molecular network, the state of which can be shifted from the healthy to a stable diseased state. We found that a group of differentially expressed genes are involved in bi-stable switches and form a core network, the state of which changes with disease progression. These findings support the idea that bi-stable switches may be a mechanism for locking the core gene network into a diseased state and for efficiently propagating perturbations to more distant regions of the network. A structural analysis of the PPARγ–RXRα dimer complex supports the hypothesis of a major structural change between the two states, and this may represent an important mechanism leading to the differential expression observed in the core network.",metabolic syndrome;PPARγ;protein population shift;bi-stable switches;disease-related networks

Although structural data for its in-plane membrane anchor and domain D1 are available, the structure of domains 2 (D2) and 3 (D3) remain poorly defined. We report here a comparative molecular characterization of the NS5A-D3 domains of the HCV JFH-1 (genotype 2a) and Con1 (genotype 1b) strains. Combining gel filtration, CD, and NMR spectroscopy analyses, we show that NS5A-D3 is natively unfolded. However, NS5A-D3 domains from both JFH-1 and Con1 strains exhibit a propensity to partially fold into an α-helix. NMR analysis identifies two putative α-helices, for which a molecular model could be obtained. The amphipathic nature of the first helix and its conservation in all genotypes suggest that it might correspond to a molecular recognition element and, as such, promote the interaction with relevant biological partner(s). Because mutations conferring resistance to cyclophilin inhibitors have been mapped into NS5A-D3, we also investigated the functional interaction between NS5A-D3 and cyclophilin A (CypA). CypA indeed interacts with NS5A-D3, and this interaction is completely abolished by cyclosporin A. NMR heteronuclear exchange experiments demonstrate that CypA has in vitro peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase activity toward some, but not all, of the peptidyl-prolyl bonds in NS5A-D3.

NMR titration studies demonstrate that the inhibitor binds to KSHV Pr monomers with low μM affinity. A 2.0 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of a C-terminal truncated KSHV Pr-inhibitor complex locates the binding pocket at the dimer interface and displays significant conformational perturbations at the active site, 15 Å from the allosteric site. NMR and CD data suggest that the small molecule inhibits human cytomegalovirus protease (HCMV Pr) via a similar mechanism.

A highly conserved domain in CBP/p300, the TAZ2 domain, mediates direct interaction with a variety of transcription factors including the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2). Here we report the crystal structure of a ternary complex of the p300 TAZ2 domain bound to MEF2 on DNA at 2.2Å resolution. The structure reveals three MEF2:DNA complexes binding to different sites of the TAZ2 domain. Using structure-guided mutations and a mammalian two-hybrid assay, we show that all three interfaces contribute to the binding of MEF2 to p300, suggesting that p300 may use one of the three interfaces to interact with MEF2 in different cellular contexts and that one p300 can bind three MEF2:DNA complexes simultaneously. These studies, together with previously characterized TAZ2 complexes bound to different transcription factors, demonstrate the potency and versatility of TAZ2 in protein–protein interactions. Our results also support a model wherein p300 promotes the assembly of a higher-order enhanceosome by simultaneous interactions with multiple DNA-bound transcription factors.",

Five proteins in the type II secretion system share sequence homology with pilin subunits of type IV pili and are called the pseudopilins.

The other four minor pseudopilins, XcpUH, XcpVI, XcpWJ and XcpXK, play less well defined roles in pseudopilus formation. It was recently discovered that these four minor pseudopilins form a quaternary complex that is presumed to initiate the formation of the pseudopilus and to localize to its tip. Here, the structure of XcpWJ was refined to 1.85 Å resolution. The structure revealed the type IVa pilin fold with an embellished variable antiparallel β-sheet as also found in the XcpWJ homologue enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli GspJW and the XcpUH homologue Vibrio cholerae EpsUH. It is proposed that the exposed surface of this sheet may cradle the long N-terminal α1 helix of another pseudopilin. The final 31 amino acids of the XcpWJ structure are instrinsically disordered.

We have examined the details by which the minimal transactivation domain (TAD) of EKLF (EKLFTAD) interacts with several transcriptional regulatory factors. We report that EKLFTAD displays homology to the p53TAD and, like the p53TAD, can be divided into two functional subdomains (EKLFTAD1 and EKLFTAD2). Based on sequence analysis, we found that EKLFTAD2 is conserved in KLF2, KLF4, KLF5, and KLF15. In addition, we demonstrate that EKLFTAD2 binds the amino-terminal PH domain of the Tfb1/p62 subunit of TFIIH (Tfb1PH/p62PH) and four domains of CREB-binding protein/p300. The solution structure of the EKLFTAD2/Tfb1PH complex indicates that EKLFTAD2 binds Tfb1PH in an extended conformation, which is in contrast to the α-helical conformation seen for p53TAD2 in complex with Tfb1PH. These studies provide detailed mechanistic information into EKLFTAD functions as well as insights into potential interactions of the TADs of other KLF proteins. In addition, they suggest that not only have acidic TADs evolved so that they bind using different conformations on a common target, but that transitioning from a disordered to a more ordered state is not a requirement for their ability to bind multiple partners.",hematopoiesis;NMR spectroscopy;transcriptional activators;intrinsically unstructured domain;transcription factor IIE

Although the experimental evidence suggests that those sequence elements contribute to forming loops of chromatin, the molecular mechanism of how such looping affects the enhancer-blocking activity is still largely unknown. In this article, the roles of DNA looping in enhancer blocking are investigated by numerically simulating the DNA conformation of a prototypical model system of gene regulation. The simulated results show that the enhancer function is indeed blocked when the enhancer is looped out so that it is separated from the promoter, which explains experimental observations of gene expression in the model system. The local structural distortion of DNA caused by looping is important for blocking, so the ability of looping to block enhancers can be lost when the loop length is much larger than the persistence length of the chain.",

Glucokinase is a central regulator of glucose homeostasis as evidenced by its association with two disease states, maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and persistent hyperinsulinemia of infancy (PHHI). Mammalian glucokinase is subject to homotropic allosteric regulation by glucose — the steady-state velocity of glucose 6-phosphate production is not hyperbolic, but instead displays a sigmoidal response to increasing glucose concentrations. The positive cooperativity displayed by glucokinase is intriguing since the enzyme functions as a monomer under physiological conditions and contains only a single binding site for glucose. Despite the existence of several models of kinetic cooperativity in monomeric enzymes, a consensus has yet to be reached regarding the mechanism of allosteric regulation in glucokinase. Experimental evidence collected over the last 45 years by a number of investigators supports a link between cooperativity and slow conformational reorganizations of the glucokinase scaffold. In this review, we summarize advances in our understanding of glucokinase allosteric regulation resulting from recent X-ray crystallographic, pre-equilibrium kinetic and high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance investigations. We conclude with a brief discussion of unanswered questions regarding the mechanistic basis of kinetic cooperativity in mammalian glucokinase.",Mammalian glucokinase;Monomeric kinetic cooperativity;Maturity-onset diabetes of the young;Diabetes mellitus;Hyperinsulinemia of infancy;Mnemonic model;Ligand-induced slow transition model;Enzyme functional dynamics

We hypothesized that the well conserved non-canonical residue Gly-126 causes local destabilization of Tm. To test this, we substituted Gly-126 in skeletal muscle α-Tm either with an Ala residue, which should stabilize the Tm α-helix, or with an Arg residue, which is expected to stabilize both α-helix and coiled-coil structure of Tm. We have shown that both mutations dramatically reduce the rate of Tm proteolysis by trypsin at Asp-133. Differential scanning calorimetry was used for detailed investigation of thermal unfolding of the Tm mutants, both free in solution and bound to F-actin. It was shown that a significant part of wild type Tm unfolds in a non-cooperative manner at low temperature, and both mutations confer cooperativity to this part of the Tm molecule. The size of the flexible middle part of Tm is estimated to be 60–70 amino acid residues, about a quarter of the Tm molecule. Thus, our results show that flexibility is unevenly distributed in the Tm molecule and achieves the highest extent in its middle part. We conclude that the highly conserved Gly-126, acting in concert with the previously identified non-canonical Asp-137, destabilizes the middle part of Tm, resulting in a more flexible region that is important for Tm function.",Protein Denaturation;Protein Domains;Protein Stability;Protein Structure;Site-directed Mutagenesis;Skeletal Muscle;Actin-Tropomyosin Interaction;Differential Scanning Calorimetry;Regulation Of Muscle Contraction;Tropomyosin

","Coupled equilibria play important roles in controlling information flow in biochemical systems, including allosteric molecules and multidomain proteins. In the simplest case, two equilibria are coupled to produce four interconverting states. In this study, we assessed the feasibility of determining the degree of coupling between two equilibria in a four-state system via relaxation dispersion measurements. A major bottleneck in this effort is the lack of efficient approaches to data analysis. To this end, we designed a strategy to efficiently evaluate the smoothness of the target function surface (TFS). Using this approach, we found that the TFS is very rough when fitting benchmark CPMG data to all adjustable variables of the four-state equilibria. After constraining a portion of the adjustable variables, which can often be achieved through independent biochemical manipulation of the system, the smoothness of TFS improves dramatically, although it is still insufficient to pinpoint the solution. The four-state equilibria can be finally solved with further incorporation of independent chemical shift information that is readily available. We also used Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate how well each adjustable parameter can be determined in a large kinetic and thermodynamic parameter space and how much improvement can be achieved in defining the parameters through additional measurements. The results show that in favorable conditions the combination of relaxation dispersion and biochemical manipulation allow the four-state equilibrium to be parameterized, and thus coupling strength between two processes to be determined.",Allostery;Allosteric coupling strength;Relaxation dispersion;Curve fitting;Four-state equilibrium

It is one the three main antigens of a multicomponent vaccine against serogroup B meningitis (4CMenB), which has just completed phase III clinical trials in infants. In contrast to the other two main vaccine components, little is known about the origin of the immunogenicity of this antigen, and about its ability to induce a strong cross-bactericidal response in animals and humans. To characterize NHBA in terms of its structural/immunogenic properties, we have analyzed its sequence and identified a C-terminal region that is highly conserved in all strains. We demonstrate experimentally that this region is independently folded, and solved its three-dimensional structure by nuclear magnetic resonance. Notably, we need detergents to observe a single species in solution. The NHBA domain fold consists of an 8-strand β-barrel that closely resembles the C-terminal domains of N. meningitidis factor H-binding protein and transferrin-binding protein B. This common fold together with more subtle structural similarities suggest a common ancestor for these important antigens and a role of the β-barrel fold in inducing immunogenicity against N. meningitidis.

Each half of the double-length TyrRS contains a catalytic domain and an anticodon-binding domain, however the two halves retain only 17% sequence identity to each other. The structural and functional consequences of this duplication and divergence are unclear. TyrRS normally forms a homodimer in which the active site of one monomer pairs with the anticodon-binding domain from the other. However, crystal structures of Leishmania major TyrRS show that instead the two halves of a single molecule form a pseudo-dimer resembling the canonical TyrRS dimer. Curiously, the C-terminal copy of the catalytic domain has lost the catalytically important HIGH and KMSKS motifs characteristic of Class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Thus the pseudo-dimer contains only one functional active site, contributed by the N-terminal half, and only one functional anticodon recognition site, contributed by the C-terminal half. Despite biochemical evidence for negative cooperativity between the two active sites of the usual TyrRS homodimer, previous structures have captured a crystallographically-imposed symmetric state. As the L. major TyrRS pseudo-dimer is inherently asymmetric, conformational variations observed near the active site may be relevant to understanding how the state of a single active site is communicated across the dimer interface. Furthermore, substantial differences between trypanosomal TyrRS and human homologs are promising for the design of inhibitors that selectively target the parasite enzyme.",aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase;protozoa;drug target;tropical disease

In eukaryotes, PQC degradation is primarily achieved by ubiquitin ligases that attach ubiquitin to misfolded proteins for proteasome degradation. To function effectively, PQC ubiquitin ligases must distinguish misfolded proteins from their normal counterparts by recognizing an attribute of structural abnormality commonly shared among misfolded proteins. However, the nature of the structurally abnormal feature recognized by most PQC ubiquitin ligases is unknown. Here we demonstrate that the yeast nuclear PQC ubiquitin ligase San1 recognizes exposed hydrophobicity in its substrates. San1 recognition is triggered by exposure of as few as five contiguous hydrophobic residues, which defines the minimum window of hydrophobicity required for San1 targeting. We also find that the exposed hydrophobicity recognized by San1 can cause aggregation and cellular toxicity, underscoring the fundamental protective role for San1-mediated PQC degradation of misfolded nuclear proteins.",

We find that independently of the choice of aligner, the rate of false positives is unacceptably high. Our study is a whole-genome analysis of all protein-coding genes in 12 Drosophila genomes annotated in either all 12 species (∼6690 genes) or in the six melanogaster group species. We compare six popular aligners: PRANK, T-Coffee, ClustalW, ProbCons, AMAP, and MUSCLE, and find that the aligner choice strongly influences the estimates of positive selection. Differences persist when we use (1) different stringency cutoffs, (2) different selection inference models, (3) alignments with or without gaps, and/or additional masking, (4) per-site versus per-gene statistics, (5) closely related melanogaster group species versus more distant 12 Drosophila genomes. Furthermore, we find that these differences are consequential for downstream analyses such as determination of over/under-represented GO terms associated with positive selection. Visual analysis indicates that most sites inferred as positively selected are, in fact, misaligned at the codon level, resulting in false positive rates of 48%–82%. PRANK, which has been reported to outperform other aligners in simulations, performed best in our empirical study as well. Unfortunately, PRANK still had a high, and unacceptable for most applications, false positives rate of 50%–55%. We identify misannotations and indels, many of which appear to be located in disordered protein regions, as primary culprits for the high misalignment-related error levels and discuss possible workaround approaches to this apparently pervasive problem in genome-wide evolutionary analyses.",

The two disorders sometimes present together, making a comparative study of interest. Both ALS and PD are neurodegenerative diseases, and are characterized by the presence of intraneuronal inclusions; however, different classes of neurons are affected and the primary protein in the inclusions differs between the diseases, and in some cases is different in distinct forms of the same disease. These observations might suggest that the more general approach of proteostasis pathway alteration would be a powerful one in treating these disorders. Examining results from human genetics and studies in model organisms, as well as from biochemical and biophysical characterization of the proteins involved in both diseases, we find that most instances of PD can be considered as arising from the misfolding, and self-association to a toxic species, of the small neuronal protein α-synuclein, and that proteostasis strategies are likely to be of value for this disorder. For ALS, the situation is much more complex and less clear-cut; the available data are most consistent with a view that ALS may actually be a family of disorders, presenting similarly but arising from distinct and nonoverlapping causes, including mislocalization of some properly folded proteins and derangement of RNA quality control pathways. Applying proteostasis approaches to this disease may require rethinking or broadening the concept of what proteostasis means.",

Correct identification of protein lysine ubiquitylation sites is of fundamental importance to understand the molecular mechanism of lysine ubiquitylation in biological systems. This paper develops a novel computational method to effectively identify the lysine ubiquitylation sites based on the ensemble approach. In the proposed method, 468 ubiquitylation sites from 323 proteins retrieved from the Swiss-Prot database were encoded into feature vectors by using four kinds of protein sequences information. An effective feature selection method was then applied to extract informative feature subsets. After different feature subsets were obtained by setting different starting points in the search procedure, they were used to train multiple random forests classifiers and then aggregated into a consensus classifier by majority voting. Evaluated by jackknife tests and independent tests respectively, the accuracy of the proposed predictor reached 76.82% for the training dataset and 79.16% for the test dataset, indicating that this predictor is a useful tool to predict lysine ubiquitylation sites. Furthermore, site-specific feature analysis was performed and it was shown that ubiquitylation is intimately correlated with the features of its surrounding sites in addition to features derived from the lysine site itself. The feature selection method is available upon request.",ubiquitylation;ensemble classifier;support vector machine;lysine ubiquitylation sites

;1These authors contributed equally to this work","Most eukaryotic proteins destined for imminent destruction are first tagged with a chain of ubiquitin molecules and are subsequently dismantled by the proteasome. Ubiquitin-independent degradation of substrates by the proteasome, however, also occurs. The number of documented proteasome-dependent, ubiquitin-independent degradation events remains relatively small but continues to grow. Proteins involved in oncogenesis and tumor suppression make up the majority of the known cases for this type of protein destruction. Provocatively, viruses with confirmed or suspected oncogenic properties are also prominent participants in the pantheon of ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation events. In this review, we identify and describe examples of proteasome-dependent, ubiquitin-independent protein degradation that occur during tumor virus infections, speculate why this type of protein destruction may be preferred during oncogenesis, and argue that this uncommon type of protein turnover represents a prime target for antiviral and anticancer therapeutics.",

Though many PP1 regulatory proteins share at least one PP1 binding motif, usually the RVxF motif, it was recently discovered that certain pairs of targeting and inhibitor proteins bind PP1 simultaneously to form PP1 heterotrimeric complexes. To date, structural information for these heterotrimeric complexes, and, in turn, how they direct PP1 activity is entirely lacking. Using a combination of NMR spectroscopy, biochemistry and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we show that major structural rearrangements in both spinophilin (targeting) and Inhibitor-2 (I-2, inhibitor) are essential for the formation of the heterotrimeric PP1:spinophilin:I-2 (PSI) complex. The RVxF motif of I-2 is released from PP1 during the formation of PSI, making the less prevalent SILK motif of I-2 essential for complex stability. The release of the I-2 RVxF motif allows for enhanced flexibility of both I-2 and spinophilin in the heterotrimeric complex. In addition, we used inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy to show that PP1 contains two metals in both heterodimeric complexes (PP1:spinophilin and PP1:I2) and PSI, demonstrating that PSI retains the biochemical characteristics of the PP1:I2 holoenzyme. Finally, we combined the NMR and biochemical data with SAXS and molecular dynamics simulations to generate a structural model of the full heterotrimeric PSI complex. Collectively, these data reveal the molecular events that enable PP1 heterotrimeric complexes to exploit both the targeting and inhibitory features of the PP1-regulatory proteins to form multi-functional PP1 holoenzymes.",NMR spectroscopy;Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS);protein regulation;Protein Phosphatase 1;ICP-AES;Metalloenzyme

","While an extensive body of knowledge has accumulated on the structures of transcription factors, DNA and their complexes from both NMR and crystallography, much less is known at a molecular level regarding the mechanisms whereby transcription factors locate their specific DNA target site within an overwhelming sea of non-specific DNA sites. Indirect kinetic data suggested that three processes are involved in the search procedure: jumping by dissociation of the protein from the DNA followed by re-association at another site, direct transfer from one DNA molecule or segment to another, and one-dimensional sliding. In this brief perspective we summary recent NMR developments from our laboratory that have permitted direct characterization of the species and molecular mechanisms involved in the target search process, including the detection of highly transient sparsely-populated states. The main tool in these studies involves the application of paramagnetic relaxation enhancement, supplemented by z-exchange spectroscopy, lineshape analysis and residual dipolar couplings. These studies led to the first direct demonstration of rotation-coupled sliding of a protein along the DNA and the direct transfer of a protein from one DNA molecule to another without dissociating into free solution.",protein-DNA interactions;sliding;direct transfer;target search process;paramagnetic relaxation enhancement;z-exchange spectroscopy;lineshape analysis

Quantification can even be performed label-free.(31) SILAC technology employs stable isotopic variants of amino acids for metabolic labeling of endogenous proteins and subsequent quantification.(32) Labeling can also be performed postharvesting using chemical methods such as iTRAQ.(28) Labeled marker peptides are used for AQUA, and these peptides are spiked at known concentrations to enable absolute quantifications.29,30 Quantitative proteomics is particularly useful for studying ubiquitylation dynamics in response to different stimuli. Furthermore, control cell populations can be included in experiments to distinguish between ubiquitin target proteins and contaminants. Cell lines can be used that express tagged ubiquitin or tagged UBL proteins. In SILAC experiments, these cell lines and control cell populations are differentially labeled using isotopic variants of arginine and lysine and cells are treated with specific stimuli.(33) Cells are lysed in a denaturing buffer to inactivate proteases, and ubiquitin conjugates or UBL conjugates are subsequently purified. After trypsin digestion and analysis of the digested peptides by mass spectrometry, database searches enable protein identification. Specific software is employed to determine ratios between isotopic variants of peptides to identify target proteins that are affected by specific treatments and to distinguish between target proteins and contaminants.34−36",

For DegP, a periplasmic protease, substrates promote assembly of inactive hexamers into proteolytically active cages with 12, 18, 24, or 30 subunits. Here, we show that sensitive activation and cage assembly require covalent linkage of distinct substrate sequences that affect degradation (degrons). One degron binds the DegP active site and another degron binds a separate tethering site in PDZ1 in the crystal structure of a substrate-bound DegP dodecamer. FRET experiments demonstrate that active cages assemble rapidly in a reaction that is positively cooperative in substrate concentration, remain stably assembled while uncleaved substrate is present, and dissociate once degradation is complete. Thus, the energy of binding of linked substrate degrons drives assembly of the proteolytic machine responsible for subsequent degradation. Substrate cleavage and depletion results in disassembly, ensuring that DegP is proteolytically active only when sufficient quantities of protein substrates are present.",

Positional cloning led to the discovery of a nonsense mutation in Spata22, a hitherto uncharacterized gene conserved among bony vertebrates. Expression of both transcript and protein is restricted predominantly to germ cells of both sexes. Germ cells of repro42 mutant mice express Spata22 transcript, but not SPATA22 protein. Gametogenesis is profoundly affected by the mutation, and germ cells in repro42 mutant mice do not progress beyond early meiotic prophase, with subsequent germ cell loss in both males and females. The Spata22 gene is essential for one or more key events of early meiotic prophase, as homologous chromosomes of mutant germ cells do not achieve normal synapsis or repair meiotic DNA double-strand breaks.

Despite its intriguing structure, unique properties and cellular localization, the enzymatic mechanism and biological function of hCINAP have remained poorly characterized. Here, we offer the first high-resolution structure of hCINAP in complex with the substrate ADP (and dADP), the structure of hCINAP with a sulfate ion bound at the AMP binding site, and the structure of the ternary complex hCINAP-Mg2+ADP-Pi. Induced fit docking calculations are used to predict the structure of the hCINAP-Mg2+ATP-AMP ternary complex. Structural analysis suggested a functional role for His79 in the Walker B motif. Kinetic analysis of mutant hCINAP-H79G indicates that His79 affects both AK and ATPase catalytic efficiency and induces homodimer formation. Finally, we show that in vivo expression of hCINAP-H79G in human cells is toxic and drastically deregulates the number and appearance of CBs in the cell nucleus. Our findings suggest that hCINAP may not simply regulate nucleotide homeostasis, but may have broader functionality, including control of CB assembly and disassembly in the nucleus of human cells.",crystal structure;adenylate kinase 6;ATPase;coilin;Cajal bodies

As described herein, we have determined the solution structure of an N-terminal unique domain isolated from nuclear valosin-containing protein (VCP)-like protein 2 (NVL2UD). NVL2UD contains three α helices with an organization resembling that of a winged helix motif, whereas a pair of β-strands is missing. The structure is unique and distinct from those of other known type II AAA-ATPases, such as VCP. Consequently, we identified nucleolin from a HeLa cell extract as a binding partner of this domain. Nucleolin contains a long (∼300 amino acids) intrinsically unstructured region, followed by the four tandem RNA recognition motifs and the C-terminal glycine/arginine-rich domain. Binding analyses revealed that NVL2UD potentially binds to any of the combinations of two successive RNA binding domains in the presence of RNA. Furthermore, NVL2UD has a characteristic loop, in which the key basic residues RRKR are exposed to the solvent at the edge of the molecule. The mutation study showed that these residues are necessary and sufficient for nucleolin-RNA complex binding as well as nucleolar localization. Based on the observations presented above, we propose that NVL2 serves as an unfoldase for the nucleolin-RNA complex. As inferred from its RNA dependence and its ATPase activity, NVL2 might facilitate the dissociation and recycling of nucleolin, thereby promoting efficient ribosome biogenesis.",ATPases;NMR;Nucleolus;Ribosome Assembly;RNA-binding Protein

When supplemented by SAXS data alone, the symmetric docking calculations converge to two local minima, showing that the use of SAXS data effectively eliminates the search in many additional false minima of the docking energy landscape otherwise observed in an unbiased calculation (Supporting Information Figure 6b, green versus red points). Inspection of representative dimer structures from each minimum shows that one corresponds to the native structure, while the other is a dimer in which one of the monomeric subunits is inverted relative to its native orientation (Supporting Information Figure 6d, e). This results in very similar SAXS profiles (Supporting Information Figure 6a) and Rosetta energies, suggesting that additional data types, such as RDCs, are needed for full convergence to a single structure. In fact, with the use of RDCs for the NH bond vectors alone in addition to the SAXS data, our method converges to the native dimer structure (Supporting Information Figure 6b, blue points). This indicates that the use of SAXS data can complement RDCs in dimer structure determination, by reducing the amount of RDC data required to achieve convergence (68 vs 261 RDCs required to achieve convergence in the absence of SAXS data).",

However, the fundamental question has remained: Do they fold because they are biological, and evolution has selected sequences which fold? Or is folding a common trait, widespread throughout sequence space? To address this question arbitrary, unevolved, random-sequence proteins were examined for structural features found in folded, biological proteins. Libraries of long (71 residue), random-sequence polypeptides, with ensemble amino acid composition near the mean for natural globular proteins, were expressed as cleavable fusions with ubiquitin. The structural properties of both the purified pools and individual isolates were then probed using circular dichroism, fluorescence emission, and fluorescence quenching techniques. Despite this necessarily sparse “sampling” of sequence space, structural properties that define globular biological proteins, namely collapsed conformations, secondary structure, and cooperative unfolding, were found to be prevalent among unevolved sequences. Thus, for polypeptides the size of small proteins, natural selection is not necessary to account for the compact and cooperative folded states observed in nature.",protein folding;evolution;sequence space

Many of the proteins required for formation and maintenance of these compartments share an evolutionary history. Here, we identify the SEA (Seh1-associated) protein complex in yeast that contains the nucleoporin Seh1 and Sec13, the latter subunit of both the nuclear pore complex and the COPII coating complex. The SEA complex also contains Npr2 and Npr3 proteins (upstream regulators of TORC1 kinase) and four previously uncharacterized proteins (Sea1–Sea4). Combined computational and biochemical approaches indicate that the SEA complex proteins possess structural characteristics similar to the membrane coating complexes COPI, COPII, the nuclear pore complex, and, in particular, the related Vps class C vesicle tethering complexes HOPS and CORVET. The SEA complex dynamically associates with the vacuole in vivo. Genetic assays indicate a role for the SEA complex in intracellular trafficking, amino acid biogenesis, and response to nitrogen starvation. These data demonstrate that the SEA complex is an additional member of a family of membrane coating and vesicle tethering assemblies, extending the repertoire of protocoatomer-related complexes.",

Our biochemical analysis of E1 helicase demonstrates that a 26-residue C-terminal segment is critical for maintaining the hexameric assembly. As this segment was not resolved in previous crystallographic analysis of E1 and LTag hexameric helicases, we determined the solution structure of the intact hexameric E1 helicase by Small Angle X-ray Scattering. We find that the C-terminal segment is flexible and occupies a cleft between adjacent subunits in the ring. Electrostatic potential calculations indicate that the negatively charged C-terminus can bridge the positive electrostatic potentials of adjacent subunits. Our observations support a model in which the C-terminal peptide serves as a flexible ‘brace’ maintaining the oligomeric state during conformational changes associated with ATP hydrolysis. We argue that these interactions impart processivity to DNA unwinding. Sequence and disorder analysis suggest that this mechanism of hexamer stabilization would be conserved among papillomavirus E1 and polyomavirus LTag hexameric helicases.",

OPN exists in many different isoforms differing in phosphorylation status that are likely to interact differently with integrins. The C-terminal region of OPN is particularly well conserved among mammalian species, which suggests an important functional role of this region. In this study, we show that modification of the extreme C terminus of OPN plays an important regulatory role for the interaction with the αVβ3-integrin. It is demonstrated that highly phosphorylated OPN has a much reduced capability to promote cell adhesion via the αVβ3-integrin compared with lesser phosphorylated forms. The cell attachment promoted by highly phosphorylated OPN could be greatly increased by both dephosphorylation and proteolytic removal of the C terminus. Using recombinantly expressed OPN containing a tag in the N or C terminus, it is shown that a modification in the C-terminal part significantly reduces the adhesion of cells to OPN via the αVβ3-integrin, whereas modification of the N terminus does not influence the binding. The inhibited binding of the αVβ3-integrin to OPN could be restored by proteolytic removal of the C terminus by thrombin and plasmin. These data illustrate a novel mechanism regulating the interaction of OPN and the αVβ3-integrin by modification of the highly conserved C-terminal region of the protein.",Cell Adhesion;Integrins;Protein Phosphorylation;Protein Structure;Recombinant Protein Expression;Osteopontin

SIB1 (SIB1 FKBP22) is a homodimeric protein with peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity. Each monomer consists of the N-terminal domain responsible for dimerization and C-terminal catalytic domain. To reveal interactions at the dimer interface of SIB1 FKBP22, the crystal structure of the N-domain of SIB1 FKBP22 (SN-FKBP22, residues 1-68) was determined at 1.9 Å resolution. SN-FKBP22 forms a dimer, in which each monomer consists of three helices (α1, α2, and α3N). In the dimer, two monomers have head-to-head interactions, in which residues 8–64 of one monomer form tight interface with the corresponding residues of the other. The interface is featured by the presence of a Val-Leu knot, in which Val37 and Leu41 of one monomer interact with Val41 and Leu37 of the other, respectively. To examine whether SIB1 FKBP22 is dissociated into the monomers by disruption of this knot, the mutant protein V37R/L41R-FKBP22, in which Val37 and Leu41 of SIB1 FKBP22 are simultaneously replaced by Arg, was constructed and biochemically characterized. This mutant protein was indistinguishable from the SIB1 FKBP22 derivative lacking the N-domain in oligomeric state, far-UV CD spectrum, thermal denaturation curve, PPIase activity, and binding ability to a folding intermediate of protein, suggesting that the N-domain of V37R/L41R-FKBP22 is disordered. We propose that a Val-Leu knot at the dimer interface of SIB1 FKBP22 is important for dimerization and dimerization is required for folding of the N-domain.",FKBP22;Shewanela sp.

It is one of three related, PKA-regulated inhibitors of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1). These inhibitors seem to have appeared in early vertebrate ancestors, possibly Gnathostomes. DARPP-32 has additional important biochemical properties including inhibition of PKA when phosphorylated by Cdk5 and regulation by casein kinases 1 and 2. It is highly enriched in specific neuronal populations, especially striatal medium-size spiny neurons. As PP1 inhibitor DARPP-32 amplifies and/or mediates many actions of PKA at the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm, with a broad spectrum of potential targets and functions. DARPP-32 also undergoes a continuous and tightly regulated cytonuclear shuttling. This trafficking is controlled by phosphorylation of Ser-97, which is necessary for nuclear export. When phosphorylated on Thr-34 and dephosphorylated on Ser-97, DARPP-32 can inhibit PP1 in the nucleus and modulate signaling pathways involved in the regulation of chromatin response. Recent work with multiple transgenic and knockout mutant mice has allowed the dissection of DARPP-32 function in striato-nigral and striato-pallidal neurons. It is implicated in the action of therapeutic and abused psychoactive drugs, in prefrontal cortex function, and in sexual behavior. However, the contribution of DARPP-32 in human behavior remains poorly understood. Post-mortem studies in humans suggest possible alterations of DARPP-32 levels in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Genetic studies have revealed a polymorphism with possible association with psychological and psychopathological traits. In addition, a short isoform of DARPP-32, t-DARPP, plays a role in cancer, indicating additional signaling properties. Thus, DARPP-32 is a non-essential but tightly regulated signaling hub molecule which may improve the general performance of the neuronal circuits in which it is expressed.",dopamine;glutamate;cAMP;protein-phosphatase 1;CDK5;behavior;addiction;Parkinson’s disease

We find that ligand association results in observable structural changes at the binding sites but no significant changes to the overall conformation of the domain. These data support models for regulation of Rb-E2F binding that do not require considerable structural changes in the pocket domain.",retinoblastoma protein;tumor-suppressor protein;cell cycle;transcription regulation;protein-protein interactions;x-ray structure

La has also been hypothesized to assist pre-tRNAs in attaining their native fold through RNA chaperone activity. In addition to binding polymerase III transcripts, human La has also been shown to enhance the translation of several internal ribosome entry sites and upstream ORF-containing mRNA targets, also potentially through RNA chaperone activity. Using in vitro FRET-based assays, we show that human and Schizosaccharomyces pombe La proteins harbor RNA chaperone activity by enhancing RNA strand annealing and strand dissociation. We use various RNA substrates and La mutants to show that UUU-3′OH-dependent La-RNA binding is not required for this function, and we map RNA chaperone activity to its RRM1 motif including a noncanonical α3-helix. We validate the importance of this α3-helix by appending it to the RRM of the unrelated U1A protein and show that this fusion protein acquires significant strand annealing activity. Finally, we show that residues required for La-mediated RNA chaperone activity in vitro are required for La-dependent rescue of tRNA-mediated suppression via a mutated suppressor tRNA in vivo. This work delineates the structural elements required for La-mediated RNA chaperone activity and provides a basis for understanding how La can enhance the folding of its various RNA targets.",Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET);Gene Expression;Molecular Chaperone;Nucleic Acid Structure;RNA;RNA Folding;RNA Processing;RNA Structure;RNA-binding Proteins;Transfer RNA (tRNA)

Despite this being the structural basis of most biological energy transduction, these processes are poorly understood. SAXS and NMR spectroscopy experiments at ambient and high hydrostatic pressure were used to examine how the presence and ionization of Lys-66, buried in the hydrophobic core of a stabilized variant of staphylococcal nuclease, affect conformation and dynamics. NMR spectroscopy at atmospheric pressure showed previously that the neutral Lys-66 affects slow conformational fluctuations globally, whereas the effects of the charged form are localized to the region immediately surrounding position 66. Ab initio models from SAXS data suggest that when Lys-66 is charged the protein expands, which is consistent with results from NMR spectroscopy. The application of moderate pressure (< 2 kbar) at pH values where Lys-66 is normally neutral at ambient pressure left most of the structure unperturbed but produced significant non-linear changes in chemical shifts in the helix where Lys-66 is located. Above 2 kbar pressure at these pH values the protein with Lys-66 unfolded cooperatively adopting a relatively compact, albeit random structure according to Kratky analysis of the SAXS data. In contrast, at low pH and high pressure the unfolded state of the variant with Lys-66 is more expanded than that of the reference protein. The combined global and local view of the structural reorganization triggered by ionization of the internal Lys-66 reveals more detectable changes than were previously suggested by NMR spectroscopy at ambient pressure.",

How can this shift occur when conditions in the ischemic heart are unfavorable for the expression, folding and secretion of most cardiomyokines? Perhaps cardiomyokines whose secretion is maintained or increased during ischemia are unusual, in that they can withstand the unfavorable conditions. Since the stress-induced cardiomyokines could impact how the heart responds to potentially lethal stresses, such as ischemia, identifying them and characterizing their functions will broaden our understanding of how to heal the damaged heart.",cardiomyokines;protein secretion;ER stress response;myocardial infarction;ischemia;protein folding

These assemblies are composed of mechanoproteins that can mechanically deform and exert force. Sometimes, small-nucleotide hydrolysis is coupled to mechanical deformations. In this review, we describe the general principle for an understanding of the coupling of mechanics with chemistry in mechanochemical systems. We apply this principle to understand bacterial cell shape and morphogenesis and how mechanical forces can influence peptidoglycan cell wall growth. We review a model that can potentially reconcile the growth dynamics of the cell wall with the role of cytoskeletal proteins such as MreB and crescentin. We also review the application of mechanochemical principles to understand the assembly and constriction of the FtsZ ring. A number of potential mechanisms are proposed, and important questions are discussed.",

Mammals have three members of the methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase family, including cytosolic MsrB1, mitochondrial MsrB2 and endoplasmic reticulum MsrB3. Here, we report the solution structure of reduced Mus musculus MsrB2 using high resolution NMR spectroscopy. MsrB2 is a β-strand rich globular protein consisting of eight all anti-parallel β-strands and three N-terminal α-helical segments. The latter secondary structure elements represent the main structural difference between mammalian MsrB2 and MsrB1. Structural comparison of mammalian and bacterial MsrB structures indicates that the general topology of this MsrB family is maintained and that MsrB2 more resembles bacterial MsrBs than MsrB1. Structural and biochemical analysis supports the catalytic mechanism of MsrB2 that, in contrast to MsrB1, does not involve a resolving cysteine (Cys). pH dependence of catalytically relevant residues in MsrB2 was accessed by NMR spectroscopy and the pKa of the catalytic Cys162 was determined to be 8.3. In addition, the pH-dependence of MsrB2 activity showed a maximum at pH 9.0, suggesting that deprotonation of the catalytic Cys is a critical step for the reaction. Further mobility analysis showed a well-structured N-terminal region, which contrasted with the high flexibility of this region in MsrB1. Our study highlights important structural and functional aspects of mammalian MsrB2 and provides a unifying picture for structure-function relationships within the MsrB protein family.",oxidoreductases;NMR spectroscopy;protein’s structure and catalytic mechanism

Here, we report a crystal structure of the LGN-binding domain (LBD) of human mInsc complexed with the N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs of human LGN at 2.6-Å resolution. In the complex, mInsc-LBD adopts an elongated structure with three binding modules—an α-helix, an extended region, and a β-sheet connected with a loop—that runs antiparallel to LGN along the concave surface of the superhelix formed by the TPRs. Structural analysis and structure-based mutagenesis define residues that are critical for mInsc–LGN association, and reveal that the activator of G-protein signaling 3 (AGS3)-binding protein Frmpd1 [4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin (FERM) and PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain-containing protein 1] and its relative Frmpd4 interact with LGN via a region homologous to a part of mInsc-LBD, whereas nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA) and the C terminus of LGN recognize the TPR domain in a manner different from that by mInsc. mInsc binds to LGN with the highest affinity (KD ≈ 2.4 nM) and effectively replaces the Frmpd proteins, NuMA, and the LGN C terminus, suggesting the priority of mInsc in binding to LGN.

Here we present a regulatory mechanism in protein-protein interactions mediated by finely-tuned structural instability coupled with molecular mimicry. We show that a set of type III secretion (TTS) autoinhibited homodimeric chaperones adopt a molten-globule-like state that transiently exposes the substrate binding site as a means to become rapidly poised for binding to their cognate protein substrates. Packing defects at the homodimeric interface stimulate binding whereas correction of these defects results in less labile chaperones that give rise to non-functional biological systems. The protein substrates use structural mimicry to offset the “weak spots” in the chaperones and to counteract their autoinhibitory conformation. This regulatory mechanism of protein activity is evolutionary conserved among several TSS systems and presents a lucid example of functional advantage conferred upon a biological system by finely-tuned structural instability.,

In this paper, we analyze vertebrate kinetochore ultrastructure by immunoelectron microscopy (EM) in the presence or absence of tension from spindle microtubules. We found that the inner kinetochore region defined by CENP-A, CENP-C, CENP-R, and the C-terminal domain of CENP-T is deformed in the presence of tension, whereas the outer kinetochore region defined by Ndc80, Mis12, and CENP-E is not stretched even under tension.

Recent studies on the physiological role of PrPC revealed that this protein has probably multiple functions, notably in cell–cell adhesion and signal transduction, and in assisting nucleic acid folding. In fact, in vitro findings indicated that the human PrP (huPrP) possesses nucleic acid binding and annealing activities, similarly to nucleic acid chaperone proteins that play essential roles in cellular DNA and RNA metabolism. Here, we show that a peptide, representing the N-terminal domain of huPrP, facilitates nucleic acid annealing by two parallel pathways nucleated through the stem termini. We also show that PrP of human or ovine origin facilitates DNA strand exchange, ribozyme-directed cleavage of an RNA template and RNA trans-splicing in a manner similar to the nucleocapsid protein of HIV-1. In an attempt to characterize inhibitors of PrP-chaperoning in vitro we discovered that the thioaptamer 5′-GACACAAGCCGA-3′ was extensively inhibiting the PrP chaperoning activities.

Toc159 is thought to be the main receptor for photosynthetic proteins, but lacking a large-scale systems approach, this hypothesis has only been tested for a handful of photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic proteins. To assess Toc159 precursor specificity, we quantitatively analyzed the accumulation of plastid proteins in two mutant lines deficient in this receptor. Parallel genome-wide transcript profiling allowed us to discern the consequences of impaired protein import from systemic transcriptional responses that contribute to the loss of photosynthetic capacity. On this basis, we defined putative Toc159-independent and Toc159-dependent precursor proteins. Many photosynthetic proteins accumulate in Toc159-deficient plastids, and, surprisingly, several distinct metabolic pathways are negatively affected by Toc159 depletion. Lack of Toc159 furthermore affects several proteins that accumulate as unprocessed N-acetylated precursor proteins outside of plastids. Together, our data show an unexpected client protein promiscuity of Toc159 that requires a far more differentiated view of Toc159 receptor function and regulation of plastid protein import, in which cytosolic Met removal followed by N-terminal acetylation of precursors emerges as an additional regulatory step.",

A structure-based model, which can be versatile in adapting its structure to external stresses while maintaining its native fold, was employed to account for several features of kinesin dynamics along the biochemical cycle. This analysis complements our current understandings of kinesin dynamics and connections to experiments. We propose a thermodynamic cycle for kinesin that emphasizes the mechanical and regulatory role of the neck linker and clarify issues related to the motor directionality, and the difference between the external stalling force and the internal tension responsible for the head-head coordination.

Understanding the structure and function of the FG-Nups barrier under real-time trafficking conditions is still a formidable challenge due to the dynamic nature of a channeled membranous environment. Recently, we have shown that three-dimensional (3D) density maps of transient interactions between the FG-Nups barrier and a cargo-free or a cargo-bound transport receptor in native NPCs can be obtained by an advanced single-molecule fluorescence microscopy approach. Moreover, we found that these interaction sites are spatially clustered into distinct groups in the periphery around a central axial channel with a diameter of approximately 10–20 nm in the NPC.

This process of evolutionary experimentation can persist for millions of years. Since it is so short lived in comparison to the lifetime of the core genes that make up the majority of most genomes, a substantial fraction of the genome and the transcriptome may—in principle—be attributable to what we will refer to as “evolutionary transients”, referring here to both the process and the genes that have gone or are undergoing this process. Using the rice gene set as a test case, we argue that this phenomenon goes a long way towards explaining why there are so many more rice genes than Arabidopsis genes, and why most excess rice genes show low similarity to eudicots.",evolutionary transients;rice;gene duplication

Using NMR spectroscopy, we characterized the in vitro binding properties of peptide models of SIM-N and SIM-C to SUMO-1 and SUMO-2. In each case, binding was mediated by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions and weakened with increasing ionic strength. Neither isolated SIM showed any significant paralog specificity, and the measured μm range KD values of SIM-N toward both SUMO-1 and SUMO-2 were ∼4-fold lower than those of SIM-C. Furthermore, SIM-N bound SUMO-1 predominantly in a parallel orientation, whereas SIM-C interconverted between parallel and antiparallel binding modes on an ms to μs time scale. The differences in affinities and binding modes are attributed to the differences in charged residues that flank the otherwise identical hydrophobic core sequences of the two SIMs. In addition, within its native context, SIM-N bound intramolecularly to the adjacent N-terminal helical bundle domain of DAXX, thus reducing its apparent affinity for SUMO. This behavior suggests a possible autoregulatory mechanism for DAXX. The interaction of a C-terminal fragment of DAXX with an N-terminal fragment of the sumoylated Ets1 transcription factor was mediated by SIM-C. Importantly, this interaction did not involve any direct contacts between DAXX and Ets1, but rather was derived from the non-covalent binding of SIM-C to SUMO-1, which in turn was covalently linked to the unstructured N-terminal segment of Ets1. These results provide insights into the binding mechanisms and hence biological roles of the DAXX SUMO-interacting motifs.",Biophysics;Ets Family Transcription Factor;Protein-Protein Interactions;Spectroscopy;Sumoylation;DAXX;NMR Spectroscopy

Previous studies with the temperature-sensitive dpb11–1 allele, truncated at amino acid 583 of the 764-amino acid protein, have suggested the model that Dpb11 couples DNA replication to the replication checkpoint. However, the dpb11–1 allele shows distinct replication defects even at permissive temperatures. Here, we determine that the 1–600-amino acid domain of DPB11 is both required and sufficient for full replication function of Dpb11 but that this domain is defective for activation of the principal checkpoint kinase Mec1 (human ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related) in vitro and in vivo. Remarkably, mutants of DPB11 that leave its replication function intact but abrogate its ability to activate Mec1 are proficient for the replication checkpoint, but they are compromised for the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint. These data suggest that replication checkpoint defects may result indirectly from defects in replisome assembly. Two conserved aromatic amino acids in the C terminus of Dpb11 are critical for Mec1 activation in vitro and for the G2/M checkpoint in yeast. Together with aromatic motifs identified previously in the Ddc1 subunit of 9-1-1, another activator of Mec1 kinase, they define a consensus structure for Mec1 activation.",Cell Cycle;Checkpoint Control;DNA Damage Response;DNA Repair;DNA Replication;Protein Kinases;Yeast Genetics;ATR Kinase;Unstructured Domains

GAGs accelerate the aggregation of many amyloidogenic peptides in vitro, but little mechanistic evidence is available to explain why. Herein, spectroscopic methods demonstrate that GAGs do not affect the secondary structure of the monomeric 8 kDa amyloidogenic fragment of human plasma gelsolin. Moreover, monomerized 8 kDa gelsolin does not bind to heparin under physiological conditions. In contrast, 8 kDa gelsolin cross-β-sheet oligomers and amyloid fibrils bind strongly to heparin, apparently due to electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged polysaccharide and a positively charged region of the 8 kDa gelsolin assemblies. Our observations are consistent with a scaffolding mechanism, whereby cross-β-sheet oligomers, upon formation, bind to GAGs, accelerating the fibril extension phase of amyloidogenesis, possibly by concentrating and orienting the oligomers to more efficiently form amyloid fibrils. Notably, heparin decreases the 8 kDa gelsolin concentration necessary for amyloid fibril formation, likely a consequence of fibril stabilization through heparin binding. Since GAG overexpression, which is common in amyloidosis, may represent a strategy to minimize cross-β-sheet oligomer toxicity by transforming them into amyloid fibrils, the mechanism described herein for GAG-mediated acceleration of 8 kDa gelsolin amyloidogenesis provides a starting point for therapeutic strategy development. The addition of GAG mimetics, small molecule sulfonates shown to reduce the amyloid load in animal models of amyloidosis, to a heparin-accelerated 8 kDa gelsolin aggregation reaction neither significantly alters the rate of amyloidogenesis nor prevents oligomers from binding to GAGs, calling into question their commonly accepted mechanism.",

Extensive research demonstrates that a majority of sHSPs and αCs can act as ATP-independent molecular chaperones by binding denaturing proteins and thereby protecting cells from damage due to irreversible protein aggregation. Because of their diverse evolutionary history, their connection to inherited human diseases, and their novel protein dynamics, sHSPs and αCs are of significant interest to many areas of biology and biochemistry. However, it is increasingly clear that no single model is sufficient to describe the structure, function or mechanism of action of sHSPs and αCs.

Dynein light chain (LC) subunits are conserved across species; however, the molecular contribution of LCs to dynein function remains controversial. One model suggests that LCs act as cargo-binding scaffolds. Alternatively, LCs are proposed to stabilize the intermediate chains (ICs) of the dynein complex. To examine the role of LCs in dynein function, we used Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which the sole function of dynein is to position the spindle during mitosis. We report that the LC8 homologue, Dyn2, localizes with the dynein complex at microtubule ends and interacts directly with the yeast IC, Pac11. We identify two Dyn2-binding sites in Pac11 that exert differential effects on Dyn2-binding and dynein function. Mutations disrupting Dyn2 elicit a partial loss-of-dynein phenotype and impair the recruitment of the dynein activator complex, dynactin. Together these results indicate that the dynein-based function of Dyn2 is via its interaction with the dynein IC and that this interaction is important for the interaction of dynein and dynactin. In addition, these data provide the first direct evidence that LC occupancy in the dynein motor complex is important for function.",

Using single molecule fluorescence to characterize the N-terminal PDZ tandem in PSD-95, we provide the first direct evidence that PDZ tandems can be structurally-independent within a full-length scaffold protein. Molecular refinement using our data converged on a single structure with an antiparallel alignment of the ligand binding sites. Devoid of interaction partners, single molecule conditions captured PSD-95 in its unbound, ground state.

Within these regions, the dynamics of regional structure and kinetics of transitions in dynamic state are believed to facilitate regulatory signaling. This study was designed to use fluorescence anisotropy techniques to acquire steady-state and kinetic information on the dynamic state of the C-domain of cTnI in the reconstituted thin filament. A series of single cysteine cTnI mutants was generated, labeled with the fluorophore tetramethylrhodamine, and subjected to various anisotropy experiments at the thin filament level. The structure of the IR was found to be less dynamic than that of the RR and the MD, and Ca2+ binding induced minimal changes in IR dynamics: the flexibility of the RR decreased, whereas the MD became more flexible. Anisotropy stopped-flow experiments showed that the kinetics describing the transition of the MD and RR from the Ca2+-bound to the Ca2+-free dynamic states were significantly faster (53.2–116.8 s−1) than that of the IR (14.1 s−1). Our results support the fly casting mechanism, implying that an unstructured MD with rapid dynamics and kinetics plays a critical role to initiate relaxation upon Ca2+ dissociation by rapidly interacting with actin to promote the dissociation of the RR from the N-domain of cTnC. In contrast, the IR responds to Ca2+ signals with slow structural dynamics and transition kinetics.

We have demonstrated previously that the E7 protein destabilizes p130, a pRb-related pocket protein, thereby promoting S-phase reentry in postmitotic, differentiated keratinocytes of squamous epithelia, and that HR HPV E7 does so more efficiently than LR HPV E7. The E7 proteins of LR HPV-11 and -6b uniquely possess lysine residues following a casein kinase II phosphorylation motif which is critical for the biological function of E7. We now show that mutations of these lysine residues elevated the efficiency of S-phase reentry, independent of their charge. An 11E7 K39,42R mutation moderately increased the association with and the destabilization of p130. Unexpectedly, polyubiquitination on these lysine residues did not attenuate E7 activity, as their mutation caused elevated proteasomal degradation and decreased protein stability. In this regard, the biologically more potent HR HPV E7 proteins were also less stable than the LR HPV E7 proteins. We infer that these lysine residues impede functional protein-protein interactions. A G22D mutation of 11E7 at the pocket protein binding motif possessed augmented efficiency in promoting S-phase reentry and strongly enhanced association with p130 and pRb. The combined effects of these two classes of 11E7 mutations exhibited an efficiency of S-phase reentry comparable to that of HR HPV E7. Thus, these nonconserved residues are primarily responsible for the differential abilities of LR and HR HPV E7 proteins to promote unscheduled DNA replication in organotypic raft cultures.",

GW182 proteins are recruited to the miRNA repression complex through direct interaction with Argonaute proteins, and they function downstream to repress target mRNA. Here we demonstrate that in human and Drosophila melanogaster cells, the critical repressive features of both the N-terminal and C-terminal effector domains of GW182 proteins are Gly/Ser/Thr-Trp (G/S/TW) or Trp-Gly/Ser/Thr (WG/S/T) motifs. These motifs, which are dispersed across both domains and act in an additive manner, function by recruiting components of the CCR 4–NOT deadenylation complex. A heterologous yeast polypeptide with engineered WG/S/T motifs acquired the ability to repress tethered mRNA and to interact with the CCR 4–NOT complex. These results identify previously unknown effector motifs functioning as important mediators of miRNA-induced silencing in both species, and they reveal that recruitment of the CCR 4–NOT complex by tryptophan-containing motifs acts downstream of GW182 to repress mRNA s, including inhibiting translation independently of deadenylation.",

P97 and P102 family members are major surface proteins of M. hyopneumoniae and play key roles in colonizing cilia via interactions with glycosaminoglycans and mucin. The p102 paralog, mhp683, and homologs in strains from different geographic origins encode a 135-kDa pre-protein (P135) that is cleaved into three fragments identified here as P45683, P48683, and P50683. A peptide sequence (TTKF↓QE) was identified surrounding both cleavage sites in Mhp683. N-terminal sequences of P48683 and P50683, determined by Edman degradation and mass spectrometry, confirmed cleavage after the phenylalanine residue. A similar proteolytic cleavage site was identified by mass spectrometry in another paralog of the P97/P102 family. Trypsin digestion and surface biotinylation studies showed that P45683, P48683, and P50683 reside on the M. hyopneumoniae cell surface. Binding assays of recombinant proteins F1683–F5683, spanning Mhp683, showed saturable and dose-dependent binding to biotinylated heparin that was inhibited by unlabeled heparin, fucoidan, and mucin. F1683–F5683 also bound porcine epithelial cilia, and antisera to F2683 and F5683 significantly inhibited cilium binding by M. hyopneumoniae cells. These data suggest that P45683, P48683, and P50683 each display cilium- and proteoglycan-binding sites.

Originally termed dementia pugilistica due to its association with boxing, the neuropathology of CTE was first described by Corsellis in 1973 in a case series of 15 retired boxers. CTE has recently been found to occur following other causes of repeated head trauma, suggesting that any repeated blows to the head, such as those that occur due to American football, hockey, soccer, professional wrestling, and physical abuse, can also lead to neurodegenerative changes. These changes often include cerebral atrophy, cavum septum pellucidum with fenestrations, shrinkage of the mammillary bodies, dense tau immunoreactive inclusions (neurofibrillary tangles, glial tangles, and neuropil neurites), diffuse axonal injury, and, in some cases, a TDP-43 proteinopathy. In association with these pathological changes, affected individuals often exhibit disordered memory and executive functioning, behavioral and personality disturbances (e.g., apathy, depression, irritability, impulsiveness, suicidality), parkinsonism, and, occasionally, motor neuron disease. At the present time, there are no formal clinical or pathological diagnostic criteria for CTE, but the distinctive neuropathological profile of the disorder lends promise for future research into its prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.",Encephalopathy;Post-Traumatic;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Concussion;Athletic Injuries;Dementia;Motor Neuron Disease

Pseudomonas infection presents clinical challenges due to its ability to form biofilms and modulate host-pathogen interactions through the secretion of virulence factors. The calcium-regulated alkaline protease (AP), a member of the repeats in toxin (RTX) family of proteins, is implicated in multiple modes of infection. A series of full-length and truncation mutants were purified for structural and functional studies to evaluate the role of Ca2+ in AP folding and activation. We find that Ca2+ binding induces RTX folding, which serves to chaperone the folding of the protease domain. Subsequent association of the RTX domain with an N-terminal α-helix stabilizes AP. These results provide a basis for the Ca2+-mediated regulation of AP and suggest mechanisms by which Ca2+ regulates the RTX family of virulence factors.",Protein Folding;Protein Stability;Pseudomonas aeruginosa;Spectroscopy;Virulence Factors

However, the reductionist approach used here can run into complications when confronted with the complexity of the cell’s biochemistry. As an example of the complications that can arise, Fig. 2 shows the influx of calcium caused by the exogenous addition of IAPP1–19 to islet cells,17 suggesting IAPP1–19 is disrupting the plasma membrane in agreement with results obtained in anionic model membranes.16,17 However, hIAPP1–19 does not cause membrane disruption in mixed model membranes with a lower anionic content intended to more accurately mimic cell surfaces.43 This discrepancy suggests either: a.) IAPP1–19 does not directly induce membrane disruption in β-cells but instead activates an unidentified endogenous calcium channel b.) IAPP1–19 does induce membrane disruption in cells and anionic membranes but does not in simple mixed zwitterionic/anionic model membrane systems. Some evidence for the latter has emerged with studies showing the importance of lipid rafts and gangliosides for the membrane interaction of IAPP.44,45 Further work on IAPP in cells and more realistic model systems, in particular using advanced tools like in cell NMR and advanced imaging techniques,46,47 is likely to yield the answer to this and other questions. The integration of biophysical and in vivo techniques remains an outstanding frontier in IAPP research, and will likely be a fruitful area of research in the future.",

To accomplish these diverse functions CASK participates in numerous protein-protein interactions. In particular, CASK forms competing CASK/Mint1/Velis and CASK/Caskin1/Velis tripartite complexes that physically associate with the cytoplasmic tail of neurexin, a transmembrane protein enriched at presynaptic sites. This study shows that a short, linear EEIWVLRK peptide motif from Caskin1 is necessary and sufficient for binding CASK. We also identified the conserved binding site for the peptide on the CASK CaM kinase domain. A related EPIWVMRQ peptide from Mint1 was also discovered to be sufficient for binding. Searching all human proteins for the Mint1/Caskin1 consensus peptide ExIWVxR revealed that TIAM1 contains a conserved EEVIWVRRE peptide that was also found to be sufficient for CASK binding in vitro. TIAM1 is well-known for its role in tumor metastasis, but it also possesses overlapping cellular and neurological functions with CASK suggesting a previously unknown cooperation between the two proteins.

The recent discovery of TA loci in obligatory intracellular species of the Rickettsia genus has prompted new research to establish whether they work as stress response elements or as addiction systems that might be toxic for the host cell. VapBC2 is a TA locus from R. felis, a pathogen responsible for flea-borne spotted fever in humans. The VapC2 toxin is a PIN-domain protein, whereas the antitoxin, VapB2, belongs to the family of swapped-hairpin β-barrel DNA-binding proteins. We have used a combination of biophysical and structural methods to characterize this new toxin/antitoxin pair. Our results show how VapB2 can block the VapC2 toxin.

Using chemically defined reaction systems we discovered that Vps21, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog of mammalian endosomal Rab5, functions in trans with itself and with at least two other endosomal Rabs to directly mediate GTP-dependent tethering. Vps21-mediated tethering was stringently and reversibly regulated by an upstream activator, Vps9, and an inhibitor, Gyp1, which were sufficient to drive dynamic cycles of tethering and de-tethering.

We present the first crystal structure of TTL (from Xenopus tropicalis), defining the structural scaffold upon which the diverse TTL-like family of tubulin-modifying enzymes is built. TTL recognizes tubulin using a bipartite strategy. It engages the tubulin tail through low-affinity, high-specificity interactions, and co-opts what is otherwise a homo-oligomerization interface in structurally related ATP-grasp fold enzymes to form a tight hetero-oligomeric complex with the tubulin body. Small-angle X-ray scattering and functional analyses reveal that TTL forms an elongated complex with the tubulin dimer and prevents its incorporation into microtubules by capping the tubulin longitudinal interface, possibly modulating the partition of tubulin between monomeric and polymeric forms.",

Given that assembly is an essential step in the viral replication cycle, it is a potential target for antiviral therapy. However, such an approach has not yet been exploited because of the lack of fundamental knowledge concerning the structures and interactions responsible for assembly. Assembling an infectious particle entails a remarkably diverse array of interactions, both specific and nonspecific, between Gag proteins and RNAs.These interactions are essential for the construction of the particle, for packaging the viral RNA into the particle, and for placement of the primer for viral DNA synthesis. Recent results have provided some new insights into each of these interactions. In the case of HIV-1 Gag, it is clear that more than one domain of the protein contributes to Gag-RNA interaction.",

Baloh; Email: ude.ltsuw@holabr","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are clinically overlapping neurodegenerative disorders whose pathophysiology remains incompletely understood. ALS initiates in a discrete location and typically progresses in a pattern consistent with spread of the degenerative process to involve neighboring regions of the motor system, although the basis of the apparent “spread” remains elusive. Recently mutations in two RNA binding proteins, TDP-43 and FUS, were identified in patients with familial ALS. In addition to being involved in numerous events related to RNA metabolism, each forms aggregates in neurons in ALS and FTLD. Recent evidence also indicates that both TDP-43 and FUS contain prion-related domains rich in glutamine (Q) and asparagine (N) residues, and in the case of TDP-43 this is the location of most disease causing mutations. This review discusses the potential relevance of the prion-related domains in TDP-43 and FUS in normal physiology, pathologic aggregation and disease progression in ALS and FTLD.",amyotrophic lateral sclerosis;frontotemporal dementia;motor neuron disease;protein aggregation;RNA metabolism;prion domain

In this study, we demonstrate optimization of MFH by tailoring MNP size to an applied AMF frequency. Unlike conventional aqueous synthesis routes, we use organic synthesis routes that offer precise control over MNP size (diameter ~ 10–25 nm), size distribution and phase purity. Furthermore, the particles are successfully transferred to the aqueous phase using a biocompatible amphiphilic polymer, and demonstrate long-term shelf life. A rigorous characterization protocol ensures that the water-stable MNPs meet all the critical requirements: (1) uniform shape and monodispersity, (2) phase purity, (3) stable magnetic properties approaching that of the bulk, (4) colloidal stability, (5) substantial shelf life and (6) pose no significant in vitro toxicity. Using a dedicated hyperthermia system, we then identified that 16 nm monodisperse MNPs (σ ~ 0.175) respond optimally to our chosen AMF conditions (f = 373 kHz, Ho = 14 kA/m); however, with a broader size distribution (σ ~ 0.284) the Specific Loss Power (SLP) decreases by 30%. Finally, we show that these tailored MNPs demonstrate maximum hyperthermia efficiency by reducing viability of Jurkat cells in vitro, suggesting our optimization translates truthfully to cell populations. In summary, we present a way to intrinsically optimize MFH by tailoring the MNPs to any applied AMF, a required precursor to optimize dose and time of treatment.",Magnetic Fluid Hyperthermia;in vitro hyperthermia;monodisperse iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles;cytotoxicity

CaMKK phosphorylates and activates CaMKI and CaMKIV, which directly activate transcription factors. In this study, we determined the 2.4 Å crystal structure of the catalytic kinase domain of the human CaMKKβ isoform complexed with its selective inhibitor, STO-609. The structure revealed that CaMKKβ lacks the αD helix and that the equivalent region displays a hydrophobic molecular surface, which may reflect its unique substrate recognition and autoinhibition. Although CaMKKβ lacks the activation loop phosphorylation site, the activation loop is folded in an active-state conformation, which is stabilized by a number of interactions between amino acid residues conserved among the CaMKK isoforms. An in vitro analysis of the kinase activity confirmed the intrinsic activity of the CaMKKβ kinase domain. Structure and sequence analyses of the STO-609-binding site revealed amino acid replacements that may affect the inhibitor binding. Indeed, mutagenesis demonstrated that the CaMKKβ residue Pro274, which replaces the conserved acidic residue of other protein kinases, is an important determinant for the selective inhibition by STO-609. Therefore, the present structure provides a molecular basis for clarifying the known biochemical properties of CaMKKβ and for designing novel inhibitors targeting CaMKKβ and the related protein kinases.",Apoptosis;Calcium;Calmodulin;Calcium Calmodulin-dependent Protein Kinase (CaMK);Drug Design;Multifunctional Enzymes;Protein Kinases;Protein Structure;Signal Transduction;Transcription Regulation

This article shows how this system evolves in time. These structures are incorporated together and evolve in different ways. When the geometric core is stable, and the tissue architecture collapses, fragmented components emerge, which reveal a hidden interior identifying how each molecule is reassembled into the original mold, using one common connection, ie, a fractal self-similarity that guided the system from the beginning. GTCHC complexes generate ejected crystal comet tail effects and produce strange helicity states that arise in the form of spin domain interactions. As the crystal growth vibration stage progresses, biofractal echo images converge in a master-built construction of embryoid bodies with enolase-selective immunopositivity in relation to clusters of triangular chiral cell organization. In our electro-optic collision model, we were able to predict and replicate all the characteristics of this complex geometry that connects a physical phenomenon with the signal patterns that generate biologic chaos. Intrinsically, fractal geometry makes spatial correction errors embrace the chaotic system in a way that permits new structures to emerge, and as a result, an ordered self-assembly of embryoid bodies with neural differentiation at the final stage of cancer development is a predictable process. We hope that further investigation of these structures will lead not only to a new way of thinking about physics and biology, but also to a rewarding area in cancer research.",embryoid bodies;cancer;electro-optic collision model

We previously reported that deletion of the first 10 N-terminal amino acids dramatically reduced lipid binding in vitro, as well as membrane binding and toxicity in yeast. Here we extend this study to human neuroblastoma SHSY-5Y cells, and find that in these cells the first 10 N-terminal residues do not affect α-synuclein membrane binding, self-association and cell viability, contrary to yeast. Differences in lipid composition, membrane fluidity and cytosolic factors between yeast and neuronal cells may account for the distinct binding behavior of the truncated variant in these two systems. Retinoic acid promotes differentiation and α-synuclein oligomer formation in neuroblastoma cells, while addition of a proteasomal inhibitor induces neurite outgrowth and toxicity to certain wild-type and truncated α-synuclein clones. Yeast recapitulate several features of α-synuclein (patho)biology, but its simplicity sets limitations; verification of yeast results in more relevant model systems is, therefore, essential.",α-synuclein;membrane binding;N-terminus;Parkinson’s disease;toxicity

The “*” represents a reorientation between two domains of each subunit that occurs in the dissociated state because it is sterically forbidden in the larger multimers. Allosteric effectors of PBGS are both intrinsic and extrinsic and are phylogenetically variable. In some species this equilibrium is modulated intrinsically by magnesium which binds at a site specific to the 8mer. In other species this equilibrium is modulated intrinsically by pH; the guanidinium group of an arginine being spatially equivalent to the allosteric magnesium ion. In humans, disease associated variants all shift the equilibrium toward the 6mer* relative to wild type. The 6mer* has a surface cavity that is not present in the 8mer and is proposed as a small molecule allosteric binding site. In silico and in vitro approaches have revealed species-specific allosteric PBGS inhibitors that stabilize the 6mer*. Some of these inhibitors are drugs in clinical use leading to the hypothesis that extrinsic allosteric inhibition of human PBGS could be a mechanism for drug side effects.",

Because of their widespread distribution among eukaryotes genomes and the potential deleterious effect of expansion/contraction of some of them in humans, low-complexity sequences are of major interest and numerous studies have attempted to describe their dynamic between genomes as well as the factors correlated to their variation and to assess their selective value. However, due to the scarcity of individual genomes within a species, most of the analyses so far have been performed at the species level with the implicit assumption that the variation both in composition and size within species is too small relative to the between-species divergence to affect the conclusions of the analysis. Here we used the available genomes of 14 Plasmodium falciparum isolates to assess the relationship between low-complexity sequence variation and factors such as nucleotide polymorphism across strains, sequence composition, and protein expression. We report that more than half of the 7,711 low-complexity sequences found within aligned coding sequences are variable in size among strains. Across strains, we observed an increasing density of polymorphic sites toward the LCR boundaries. This observation strongly suggests the joint effects of lowered selective constraints on low-complexity sequences and a mutagenic effect of these simple sequences.",Plasmodium falciparum;low complexity sequences;size variation;polymorphism

The Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource at http://elm.eu.org provides the biological community with a comprehensive database of known experimentally validated motifs, and an exploratory tool to discover putative linear motifs in user-submitted protein sequences. The current update of the ELM database comprises 1800 annotated motif instances representing 170 distinct functional classes, including approximately 500 novel instances and 24 novel classes. Several older motif class entries have been also revisited, improving annotation and adding novel instances. Furthermore, addition of full-text search capabilities, an enhanced interface and simplified batch download has improved the overall accessibility of the ELM data. The motif discovery portion of the ELM resource has added conservation, and structural attributes have been incorporated to aid users to discriminate biologically relevant motifs from stochastically occurring non-functional instances.",

Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer and spongiform encephalopathies, as well as type 2 diabetes and both localized and systemic amyloidosis, are among the conditions that are associated with the formation of amyloid fibrils. Several mathematical tools can rationalize and even predict important parameters of amyloid fibril formation. It is not clear, however, whether such algorithms have predictive powers for in vivo systems, in which protein aggregation is affected by the presence of other biological factors. In this review, we briefly describe the existing algorithms and use them to predict the effects of mutations on the aggregation of specific proteins, for which in vivo experimental data are available. The comparison between the theoretical predictions and the experimental data obtained in vivo is shown for each algorithm and experimental data set, and statistically significant correlations are found in most cases.",prediction;protein misfolding;software;TANGO;Zyggregator

Here we study how the collective action of myosin motors organizes actin filaments into contractile structures in a simplified model system devoid of biochemical regulation. We show that this self-organization occurs through an active multistage coarsening process. First, motors form dense foci by moving along the actin network structure followed by coalescence. Then the foci accumulate actin filaments in a shell around them. These actomyosin condensates eventually cluster due to motor-driven coalescence. We propose that the physical origin of this multistage aggregation is the highly asymmetric load response of actin filaments: they can support large tensions but buckle easily under piconewton compressive loads. Because the motor-generated forces well exceed this threshold, buckling is induced on the connected actin network that resists motor-driven filament sliding. We show how this buckling can give rise to the accumulation of actin shells around myosin foci and subsequent coalescence of foci into superaggregates. This new physical mechanism provides an explanation for the formation and contractile dynamics of disordered condensed actomyosin states observed in vivo.",active gels;molecular motors;nonequilibrium;soft condensed matter

We found that HMGN2 binds to both the acidic patch in the H2A-H2B dimer and to nucleosomal DNA near the entry/exit point, “stapling” the histone core and the DNA. These results provide insight into how HMGNs regulate chromatin structure through interfering with the binding of linker histone H1 to the nucleosome as well as a structural basis of how phosphorylation induces dissociation of HMGNs from chromatin during mitosis.

Rempe,"Center for Biological and Materials Sciences, MS 0895, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87185, USA;Correspondence to: vog.aidnas@epmerls","Ion binding is known to affect the properties of biomolecules and is directly involved in many biochemical pathways. Because of the highly polar environments where such ions are found, a quantum-mechanical treatment is preferable for understanding the energetics of competitive ion binding. Due to computational cost, a quantum mechanical treatment may involve several approximations, however, whose validity can be difficult to determine. Using thermodynamic cycles, we show how intuitive models for complicated ion binding reactions can be built up from simplified, isolated ion-ligand binding site geometries suitable for quantum mechanical treatment. First the ion binding free energies of individual, minimum energy structures determine their intrinsic ion selectivities. Next, the relative propensity for each minimum energy structure is determined locally from the balance of ion-ligand and ligand-ligand interaction energies. Finally, the environment external to the binding site exerts its influence both through long-ranged dispersive and electrostatic interactions with the binding site as well as indirectly through shifting the binding site compositional and structural preferences. The resulting picture unifies field-strength, topological control, and phase activation viewpoints into a single theory that explicitly indicates the important role of solute coordination state on overall reaction energetics. As an example, we show that the Na+ →K+ selectivities can be recovered by correctly considering the conformational contribution to the selectivity. This can be done even when constraining configuration space to the neighborhood around a single, arbitrarily chosen, minimum energy structure. Structural regions around minima for K+- and Na+-water clusters are exhibited that display both rigid/mechanical and disordered/entropic selectivity mechanisms for both Na+ and K+. Thermodynamic consequences of the theory are discussed with an emphasis on the role of coordination structure in determining experimental properties of ions in complex biological environments.",

However, the recognition process and phosphorylation mechanism of membrane-bound substrates by kinases are virtually unknown. cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is a ubiquitous enzyme that phosphorylates several soluble and membrane-bound substrates. In cardiomyocytes, PKA targets phospholamban (PLN), a membrane protein that inhibits the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). In the unphosphorylated state, PLN binds SERCA, reducing the calcium uptake and generating muscle contraction. PKA phosphorylation of PLN at S16 in the cytoplasmic helix relieves SERCA inhibition, initiating muscle relaxation. Using steady state kinetic assays, NMR spectroscopy, and molecular modeling we show that PKA recognizes and phosphorylates the excited, membrane detached R state of PLN. By promoting PLN from a ground state to excited state, we obtained a linear relationship between rate of phosphorylation and population of the excited state of PLN. The conformational equilibrium of PLN is crucial to regulate the extent of PLN phosphorylation as well as SERCA inhibition.",

Base-J and JBP1 are confined to some pathogenic protozoa and are absent from higher eukaryotes, prokaryotes and viruses. We show that JBP1 recognizes J-containing DNA (J-DNA) through a 160-residue domain, DB-JBP1, with 10 000-fold preference over normal DNA. The crystal structure of DB-JBP1 revealed a helix-turn-helix variant fold, a ‘helical bouquet’ with a ‘ribbon’ helix encompassing the amino acids responsible for DNA binding. Mutation of a single residue (Asp525) in the ribbon helix abrogates specificity toward J-DNA. The same mutation renders JBP1 unable to rescue the targeted deletion of endogenous JBP1 genes in Leishmania and changes its distribution in the nucleus. Based on mutational analysis and hydrogen/deuterium-exchange mass-spectrometry data, a model of JBP1 bound to J-DNA was constructed and validated by small-angle X-ray scattering data. Our results open new possibilities for targeted prevention of J-DNA recognition as a therapeutic intervention for parasitic diseases.",

This is usually accomplished via specialized protein complexes, which provide a polar transmembrane pore. Exceptions to this include bacterial toxins, which insert into and cross the lipid bilayer itself. We are studying the mechanism by which large antibacterial proteins enter Escherichia coli via specific outer membrane proteins. Here we describe the use of neutron scattering to investigate the interaction of colicin N with its outer membrane receptor protein OmpF. The positions of lipids, colicin N, and OmpF were separately resolved within complex structures by the use of selective deuteration. Neutron reflectivity showed, in real time, that OmpF mediates the insertion of colicin N into lipid monolayers. This data were complemented by Brewster Angle Microscopy images, which showed a lateral association of OmpF in the presence of colicin N. Small angle neutron scattering experiments then defined the three-dimensional structure of the colicin N-OmpF complex. This revealed that colicin N unfolds and binds to the OmpF-lipid interface. The implications of this unfolding step for colicin translocation across membranes are discussed.",Bacterial Toxins;Escherichia coli;Lipids;Membrane Biophysics;Neutron Scattering;Colicin;Deuteration;OmpF;Outer Membrane;Lipid Monolayer;SANS;Deuteration;Porin

Fluids have the ability to flow under an applied shear stress whereas solids resist shear deformations. Biological membranes require both properties for their function: high lateral fluidity and structural rigidity. Consequently, an adequate account must include, in addition to viscosity, the possibility for a nonzero shear modulus. This knowledge is still lacking as measurements of membrane shear properties have remained incomplete so far. In the present contribution we report a surface shear rheology study of different lipid monolayers that model distinct biologically relevant situations.

Here we present in vitro characterization of the polypeptide binding activity of these two subunits of the yeast enzyme, and show that the peptide-binding grooves in these proteins can transiently bind stretches of polypeptide with amino acid characteristics complementary to the characteristics of the grooves. We show that Ost6p, which has a peptide-binding groove with a strongly hydrophobic base lined by neutral and basic residues, binds peptides enriched in hydrophobic and acidic amino acids. Further, by introducing basic residues in place of the wild type neutral residues lining the peptide-binding groove of Ost3p, we engineer binding of a hydrophobic and acidic peptide. Our data supports a model of Ost3/6p function in which they transiently bind stretches of nascent polypeptide substrate to inhibit protein folding, thereby increasing glycosylation efficiency at nearby asparagine residues.",N-glycosylation;oligosaccharyltransferase;mass spectrometry;protein-peptide interactions

BACE1’s binding site is partially covered by a flexible loop on its N-terminal domain, known as the “flap,” which has been found in several conformations in crystal structures of BACE1 and other aspartyl proteases. The side chain of the invariant residue Tyr71 on the flap adopts several rotameric orientations, leading to our hypothesis that the orientation of this residue dictates the movement and conformations available to the flap. We investigated this hypothesis by performing 220 ns of molecular dynamics simulations of bound and unbound wild-type BACE1 as well as the unbound Y71A mutant. Our findings indicate that the flap exhibits various degrees of mobility and adopts different conformations depending on the Tyr71 orientation. Surprisingly, the “self-inhibited” form is stable in our simulations, making it a reasonable target for drug design. The alanine mutant, lacking a large side chain at position 71, displays significant differences in flap dynamics from wild type, freely sampling very open and closed conformations. Our simulations show that Tyr71, in addition to its previously determined functions in catalysis and substrate binding, has the important role of modulating flap conformations in BACE1.",beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1;beta-secretase;Alzheimer’s disease;molecular dynamics simulations;protein flexibility

A recent study indicated the p14 FAST protein transmembrane domain (TMD) can be functionally replaced by the TMDs of the other FAST proteins but not by heterologous TMDs, suggesting that the FAST protein TMDs are modular fusion units. We now show that the p15 FAST protein is also a modular fusogen, as indicated by the functional replacement of the p15 ectodomain with the corresponding domain from the p14 FAST protein. Paradoxically, the p15 TMD is not interchangeable with the TMDs of the other FAST proteins, implying that unique attributes of the p15 TMD are required when this fusion module is functioning in the context of the p15 ecto- and/or endodomain. A series of point substitutions, truncations, and reextensions were created in the p15 TMD to define features that are specific to the functioning of the p15 TMD. Removal of only one or two residues from the N terminus or four residues from the C terminus of the p15 TMD eliminated membrane fusion activity, and there was a direct correlation between the fusion-promoting function of the p15 TMD and the presence of N-terminal, hydrophobic β-branched residues. Substitution of the glycine residues and triserine motif present in the p15 TMD also impaired or eliminated the fusion-promoting activity of the p15 TMD. The ability of the p15 TMD to function in an ecto- and endodomain-specific context is therefore influenced by stringent sequence requirements that reflect the importance of TMD polar residues and helix-destabilizing residues.",

The T4SSs are related to bacterial conjugation systems, and are classified into two subgroups, type IVA (T4ASS) and type IVB (T4BSS). The T4BSS, which is closely related to conjugation systems of IncI plasmids, was originally found in human pathogen L. pneumophila; pathogenesis by L. pneumophila infection requires functional Dot/Icm T4BSS. A zoonotic pathogen, Coxiella burnetii, and an arthropod pathogen, Rickettsiella grylli – both of which carry T4BSSs highly similar to the Legionella Dot/Icm system – are evolutionarily closely related and comprise a monophyletic group. A growing body of bacterial genomic information now suggests that T4BSSs are not limited to Legionella and related bacteria and IncI plasmids. Here, we review the current knowledge on T4BSS apparatus and component proteins, gained mainly from studies on L. pneumophila Dot/Icm T4BSS.

Long-range intra-molecular and inter-molecular interactions at distant sites on the same receptor are crucial factors that modulate signaling function of GPCRs. Positive or negative coupling between the extracellular, the transmembrane and the intracellular domains facilitates cooperativity of activating “switches” as requirements for the functional plasticity of GPCRs.

Ideally, these virus-host protein interactions should be mapped directly in infected cell culture, but such a high standard is often difficult to reach when using conventional approaches. We thus developed a new strategy based on recombinant viruses expressing tagged viral proteins to capture both direct and indirect physical binding partners during infection. As a proof of concept, we engineered a recombinant measles virus (MV) expressing one of its virulence factors, the MV-V protein, with a One-STrEP amino-terminal tag. This allowed virus-host protein complex analysis directly from infected cells by combining modified tandem affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis. Using this approach, we established a prosperous list of 245 cellular proteins interacting either directly or indirectly with MV-V, and including four of the nine already known partners of this viral factor. These interactions were highly specific of MV-V because they were not recovered when the nucleoprotein MV-N, instead of MV-V, was tagged. Besides key components of the antiviral response, cellular proteins from mitochondria, ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, protein phosphatase 2A, and histone deacetylase complex were identified for the first time as prominent targets of MV-V and the critical role of the later protein family in MV replication was addressed. Most interestingly, MV-V showed some preferential attachment to essential proteins in the human interactome network, as assessed by centrality and interconnectivity measures. Furthermore, the list of MV-V interactors also showed a massive enrichment for well-known targets of other viruses. Altogether, this clearly supports our approach based on reverse genetics of viruses combined with high-throughput proteomics to probe the interaction network that viruses establish in infected cells.",

Particularly, the redundancy of the genetic code allows the choice between alternative codons for the same amino acid, which, although ‘synonymous,' may exert dramatic effects on the process of translation. Here we review modern developments in genomics and systems biology that have revolutionized our understanding of the multiple means by which translation is regulated. We suggest new means to model the process of translation in a richer framework that will incorporate information about gene sequences, the tRNA pool of the organism and the thermodynamic stability of the mRNA transcripts.

PRK and GAPDH are inactivated when present in this complex, a process shown in vitro to be dependent upon oxidized CP12. The importance of CP12 in vivo in higher plants, however, has not been investigated. Here, antisense suppression of CP12 in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) was observed to impact on NAD-induced PRK and GAPDH complex formation but had little effect on enzyme activity. Additionally, only minor changes in photosynthetic carbon fixation were observed. Despite this, antisense plants displayed changes in growth rates and morphology, including dwarfism and reduced apical dominance. The hypothesis that CP12 is essential to separate oxidative pentose phosphate pathway activity from Calvin-Benson cycle activity, as proposed in cyanobacteria, was tested. No evidence was found to support this role in tobacco. Evidence was seen, however, for a restriction to malate valve capacity, with decreases in NADP-malate dehydrogenase activity (but not protein levels) and pyridine nucleotide content. Antisense repression of CP12 also led to significant changes in carbon partitioning, with increased carbon allocation to the cell wall and the organic acids malate and fumarate and decreased allocation to starch and soluble carbohydrates. Severe decreases were also seen in 2-oxoglutarate content, a key indicator of cellular carbon sufficiency. The data presented here indicate that in tobacco, CP12 has a role in redox-mediated regulation of carbon partitioning from the chloroplast and provides strong in vivo evidence that CP12 is required for normal growth and development in plants.",

While the 5′ domain of the E. coli 16S rRNA can fold independently of proteins in a few seconds,60 the central and 3′ domains do not fold properly without their protein ligands. The folding time of the 3′ domain became 100 times longer when the 16S rRNA was renatured at 30 °C instead of 42 °C, and was more sensitive to base modification,61 suggesting that assembly can proceed more rapidly if metastable conformations in the rRNA are overcome. The propensity of the 16S 3′ domain to misfold may explain why many of the 3′ domain proteins do not productively join the complex until after a heat activation step 46, and why several 30S assembly factors act on the 3′ domain.",

Previous studies established that the Class-1 PEPC (PTPC homotetramer) of castor oil seeds (COS) is activated by phosphorylation at Ser-11 and inhibited by monoubiquitination at Lys-628 during endosperm development and germination, respectively. Elimination of photosynthate supply to developing COS by depodding caused the PTPC of the endosperm and cotyledon to be dephosphorylated, and then subsequently monoubiquitinated in vivo. PTPC monoubiquitination rather than phosphorylation is widespread throughout the castor plant and appears to be the predominant PTM of Class-1 PEPC that occurs in planta. The distinctive developmental patterns of PTPC phosphorylation versus monoubiquitination indicates that these two PTMs are mutually exclusive. By contrast, the BTPC: (i) is abundant in the inner integument, cotyledon, and endosperm of developing COS, but occurs at low levels in roots and cotyledons of germinated COS, (ii) shows a unique developmental pattern in leaves such that it is present in leaf buds and young expanding leaves, but undetectable in fully expanded leaves, and (iii) tightly interacts with co-expressed PTPC to form the novel and allosterically-desensitized Class-2 PEPC heteromeric complex. BTPC and thus Class-2 PEPC up-regulation appears to be a distinctive feature of rapidly growing and/or biosynthetically active tissues that require a large anaplerotic flux from phosphoenolpyruvate to replenish tricarboxylic acid cycle C-skeletons being withdrawn for anabolism.",Enzyme phosphorylation;metabolic control;monoubiquitination;phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase;post-translational modification;protein:protein interactions;tissue-specific gene expression

Using sensitive sequence profile analysis methods, we characterize a novel superfamily (the SUKH superfamily) that unites a diverse group of proteins including Smi1/Knr4, PGs2, FBXO3, SKIP16, Syd, herpesviral US22, IRS1 and TRS1, and their bacterial homologs. Using contextual analysis we present evidence that the bacterial members of this superfamily are potential immunity proteins for a variety of toxin systems that also include the recently characterized contact-dependent inhibition (CDI) systems of proteobacteria. By analyzing the toxin proteins encoded in the neighborhood of the SUKH superfamily we predict that they possess domains belonging to diverse nuclease and nucleic acid deaminase families. These include at least eight distinct types of DNases belonging to HNH/EndoVII- and restriction endonuclease-fold, and RNases of the EndoU-like and colicin E3-like cytotoxic RNases-folds. The N-terminal domains of these toxins indicate that they are extruded by several distinct secretory mechanisms such as the two-partner system (shared with the CDI systems) in proteobacteria, ESAT-6/WXG-like ATP-dependent secretory systems in Gram-positive bacteria and the conventional Sec-dependent system in several bacterial lineages. The hedgehog-intein domain might also release a subset of toxic nuclease domains through auto-proteolytic action. Unlike classical colicin-like nuclease toxins, the overwhelming majority of toxin systems with the SUKH superfamily is chromosomally encoded and appears to have diversified through a recombination process combining different C-terminal nuclease domains to N-terminal secretion-related domains. Across the bacterial superkingdom these systems might participate in discriminating `self’ or kin from `non-self’ or non-kin strains. Using structural analysis we demonstrate that the SUKH domain possesses a versatile scaffold that can be used to bind a wide range of protein partners. In eukaryotes it appears to have been recruited as an adaptor to regulate modification of proteins by ubiquitination or polyglutamylation. Similarly, another widespread immunity protein from these toxin systems, namely the suppressor of fused (SuFu) superfamily has been recruited for comparable roles in eukaryotes. In animal DNA viruses, such as herpesviruses, poxviruses, iridoviruses and adenoviruses, the ability of the SUKH domain to bind diverse targets has been deployed to counter diverse anti-viral responses by interacting with specific host proteins.",

The archetypal nudC gene from Aspergillus nidulans is a member the nud gene family, involved in maintenance of nuclear migration. This family also includes nudF whose human orthologue, Lis1, codes for a protein essential for brain cortex development. Three paralogues of NudC are known in vertebrates, NudC, NudC-like (NudCL) and NudC-like 2 (NudCL2). The fourth distantly related member of the family, CML66, contains a NudC-like domain. The three principal NudC proteins have no catalytic activity, but appear to play as yet poorly defined roles in proliferating and dividing cells. We present crystallographic and NMR studies of the human NudC protein, and discuss the results in the context of structures recently deposited by Structural Genomics centers, i.e. NudCL and mouse NudCL2. All proteins share the same core CS-domain characteristic for proteins acting either as co-chaperones of Hsp90, or as independent small heat shock proteins. However, while NudC and NudCL dimerize via an N-terminally located coiled-coil, the smaller NudCL2 lacks this motif and instead dimerizes as a result of unique domain swapping. We show that NudC and NudCL, but not NudCL2, inhibit aggregation of several target proteins, consistent with an Hsp90-independent heat shock protein function. Importantly, and in contrast to several previous reports, none of the three proteins are able to form binary complexes with Lis1. The availability of structural information will be of help in further studies of cellular functions of the NudC family.",Protein structure;crystallography;nuclear migration;chaperones;protein-protein interactions

Its activity was mapped to the 162-amino-acid propeptide domain (LOX-PP) of the lysyl oxidase precursor protein. LOX-PP inhibits Erk signaling, motility, and tumor formation in a breast cancer xenograft model; however, its mechanism of action is largely unknown. Here, a copurification-mass spectrometry approach was taken using ectopically expressed LOX-PP in HEK293T cells and the heat shock/chaperone protein Hsp70 identified. Hsp70 interaction with LOX-PP was confirmed using coimmunoprecipitation of intracellularly and bacterially expressed and endogenous proteins. The interaction was mapped to the Hsp70 peptide-binding domain and to LOX-PP amino acids 26 to 100. LOX-PP association reduced Hsp70 chaperone activities of protein refolding and survival after heat shock. LOX-PP interacted with the Hsp70 chaperoned protein c-Raf. With the use of ectopic expression of LOX-PP wild-type and deletion proteins, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown, and Lox−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts, LOX-PP interaction with c-Raf was shown to decrease downstream activation of MEK and NF-κB, migration, and anchorage-independent growth and reduce its mitochondrial localization. Thus, the interaction of LOX-PP with Hsp70 and c-Raf inhibits a critical intermediate in Ras-induced MEK signaling and plays an important role in the function of this tumor suppressor.",

Existing models posit that Cdc48 acts upstream of UPS receptors. To address this hypothesis, we examined the association of ubiquitin (Ub) conjugates with 26S proteasomes. Unexpectedly, proteasomes isolated from cdc48 mutants contain high levels of Ub conjugates and mass spectrometry identified numerous non-proteasomal proteins, including Rpb1, the largest subunit of RNA Pol II. UV-induced turnover of Rpb1 depends upon Cdc48–Ufd1–Npl4, Ubx4 and the uncharacterized adaptor, Ubx5. Ubiquitinated Rpb1, proteasomes, and Cdc48 accumulate on chromatin in UV-treated wildtype cells and the former two accumulate to higher levels in mutant cells, suggesting that degradation of Rpb1 is facilitated by Cdc48 at sites of stalled transcription. These data reveal an intimate coupling of function between proteasomes and Cdc48 that we suggest is necessary to sustain processive degradation of unstable subunits of some macromolecular protein complexes.",

RACK1 has a significant role to play in shuttling proteins around the cell, anchoring proteins at particular locations and in stabilising protein activity. It interacts with the ribosomal machinery, with several cell surface receptors and with proteins in the nucleus. As a result, RACK1 is a key mediator of various pathways and contributes to numerous aspects of cellular function.

This study sought to answer questions about the role of Potato virus A (PVA; genus Potyvirus) VPg in viral and host RNA expression. When expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves in trans, a dual role of VPg in translation is observed. It repressed the expression of monocistronic luciferase (luc) mRNA and simultaneously induced a significant upregulation in the expression of both replicating and nonreplicating PVA RNAs. This enhanced viral gene expression was due at least to the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of PVA RNA, eukaryotic initiation factors 4E and iso 4E [eIF4E/eIF(iso)4E], and the presence of a sufficient amount of VPg. Coexpression of VPg with viral RNA increased the viral RNA amount, which was not the case with the monocistronic mRNA. Both mutations at certain lysine residues in PVA VPg and eIF4E/eIF(iso)4E depletion reduced its ability to upregulate the viral RNA expression. These modifications were also involved in VPg-mediated downregulation of monocistronic luc expression. These results suggest that VPg can titrate eIF4Es from capped monocistronic RNAs. Because VPg-mediated enhancement of viral gene expression required eIF4Es, it is possible that VPg directs eIF4Es to promote viral RNA expression. From this study it is evident that VPg can serve as a specific regulator of PVA expression by boosting the viral RNA amounts as well as the accumulation of viral translation products. Such a mechanism could function to protect viral RNA from being degraded and to secure efficient production of coat protein (CP) for virion formation.",

Presequences provide directionality to the transport process and regulate the transport machineries during translocation. However, surprisingly little is known about how presequence receptors interact with the signals and what role these interactions play during preprotein transport. Here, we identify signal-binding sites of presequence receptors through photo-affinity labeling. Using engineered presequence probes, photo cross-linking sites on mitochondrial proteins were mapped mass spectrometrically, thereby defining a presequence-binding domain of Tim50, a core subunit of the TIM23 complex that is essential for mitochondrial protein import. Our results establish Tim50 as the primary presequence receptor at the inner membrane and show that targeting signals and Tim50 regulate the Tim23 channel in an antagonistic manner.",

Beyond the conserved reverse transcriptase (RT) and RNase H domains, their polymerases (P proteins) carry a unique terminal protein (TP) domain that provides a specific Tyr residue, Tyr96 in duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), to which the first nucleotide of minus-strand DNA is autocatalytically attached and extended by three more nucleotides. In vitro reconstitution of this priming reaction with DHBV P protein and cellular chaperones had revealed strict requirements for the Dε RNA stem-loop as a template and for catalytic activity of the RT domain plus RNA-binding competence of the TP domain. Chaperone dependence can be obviated by using a truncated P protein (miniP). Here, we found that miniP with a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site between TP and RT (miniPTEV) displayed authentic priming activity when supplied with α-32P-labeled deoxynucleoside triphosphates; however, protease cleavage revealed, surprisingly, that the RT domain was also labeled. RT labeling had identical requirements as priming at Tyr96 and originated from dNMP transfer to a unique Tyr residue identified as Tyr561 in the presumed RT primer grip motif. Mutating Tyr561 did not affect Tyr96 priming in vitro and only modestly reduced replication competence of an intact DHBV genome; hence, deoxynucleotidylated Tyr561 is not an obligate intermediate in TP priming. However, as a first alternative substrate for the exquisitely complex protein-priming reaction, dNMP transfer to Tyr561 is a novel tool to further clarify the mechanism of hepadnaviral replication initiation and suggests that specific priming inhibitors can be found.",

We have discovered that other cellular stressors are integrated with glucocorticoid signaling through a new hormone-independent phosphorylation site, Ser134, on the human glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Ser134 phosphorylation is induced by a variety of stress-activating stimuli in a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent manner. Cells expressing a mutant glucocorticoid receptor incapable of phosphorylation at Ser134 (S134A-GR) had significantly altered hormone-dependent genome-wide transcriptional responses and associated hormone-mediated cellular functions. The phosphorylation of Ser134 significantly increased the association of the GR with the zeta isoform of the 14-3-3 class of signaling proteins (14-3-3zeta) on chromatin promoter regions, resulting in a blunted hormone-dependent transcriptional response of select genes. These data argue that the phosphorylation of Ser134 acts as a molecular sensor on the GR, monitoring the level of cellular stress to redirect glucocorticoid-regulated signaling through altered 14-3-3zeta cofactor binding and promoter recruitment. This posttranslational modification allows prior cellular stress signals to dictate the transcriptional response to glucocorticoids.",

The HDAC-associated mammalian Rpd3S/Sin3S corepressor complex plays key roles in repressing aberrant gene transcription from cryptic transcription initiation sites and mitigating RNA polymerase II progression in intragenic regions of actively transcribed genes. The Sin3 corepressor functions as a molecular adaptor linking HDACs on the one hand, with the chromatin targeting subunits Pf1 and MRG15, on the other. Pf1 also functions as an adaptor by interacting with MRG15 and engaging in multivalent interactions with Sin3 targeting among other domains the two N-terminal PAH domains that serve as sites of interaction with sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors. Here, we structurally and functionally evaluate the interaction between the PAH2 domain of mSin3A and the SID1 motif of Pf1 and find the structural aspects to be reminiscent of the interaction between the Mad1/Mxd1 transcription factor and Sin3. Pf1 residues within a highly-conserved sequence motif immediately C-terminal to SID1 appear not to be important for the interaction with Sin3 PAH2. Unexpectedly, the MRG15 subunit competes, rather than collaborate, with Sin3 for the Pf1 segment encompassing the two conserved motifs, implying competition between two subunits for another subunit of the same chromatin-modifying complex.",Rpd3S complex;transcription regulation;transcription repression;chromatin-modifying complex assembly;PAH domain;MRG domain;protein-protein interaction;Sin3 corepressor;NMR

Methods: Two wild-type H. pylori strains, YN8 (isolated from biopsy tissue of a gastric cancer patient) and YN14 (isolated from biopsy tissue of a gastritis and duodenal ulcer patient), were used. Proteomic analysis, using a pH range of 3–10 and 5–8, was performed. The individual proteins were identified by quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer and protein database search. Results: Variation in spot patterns directed towards differential protein expression levels was observed between the strains. The gel revealed prominent proteins with several protein “families”. The comparison of protein expressions of the two strains reveals a high variability. Differentially present or absent spots were observed. Nine differentially expressed protein spots identified by Q-TOF included adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding protein, disulfide oxidoreductase B (DsbB)-like protein, N utilization substance A (NusA), ATP-dependent protease binding subunit/heat shock protein, hydantoin utilization protein A, seryl-tRNA synthetase, molybdenum ABC transporter ModD, and hypothetical proteins. Conclusions: This study suggests that H. pylori strains express/repress protein variation, not only in terms of the virulence proteins, but also in terms of physiological proteins, when they infect a human host. The difference of protein expression levels between H. pylori strains isolated from gastric cancer and gastritis may be the initiator of inflammation, and result in the different clinical presentation. In this preliminary study, we report seven differential proteins between strains, with molecule weights from approximately 10 kDa to approximately 40 kDa. Further studies are needed to investigate those proteins and their function associated with H. pylori colonization and adaptation to host environment stress.",Helicobacter pylori;Proteome;Gastric cancer;Gastritis;Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis

A network of interacting proteins is required to insert a cytoplasmic SPB precursor into the NE. A central player of this network is Nbp1 that interacts with the conserved integral membrane protein Ndc1. Here, we establish that Nbp1 is a monotopic membrane protein that is essential for SPB insertion at the inner face of the NE. In vitro and in vivo studies identified an N-terminal amphipathic α-helix of Nbp1 as a membrane-binding element, with crucial functions in SPB duplication. The karyopherin Kap123 binds to a nuclear localization sequence next to this amphipathic α-helix and prevents unspecific tethering of Nbp1 to membranes. After transport into the nucleus, Nbp1 binds to the inner nuclear membrane. These data define the targeting pathway of a SPB component and suggest that the amphipathic α-helix of Nbp1 is important for SPB insertion into the NE from within the nucleus.",amphipathic helix;in-plane membrane anchor;Kap123;Nbp1;spindle pole body duplication

At the same time, the system must ensure the stability and functionality of its macromolecules. Fluctuations in the environment are sensed by highly conserved stress responses and homeostatic mechanisms, and of these, the heat shock response (HSR) represents an essential response to acute and chronic proteotoxic damage. However, unlike the strategies employed to maintain the integrity of the genome, protection of the proteome must be tailored to accommodate the normal flux of nonnative proteins and the differences in protein composition between cells, and among individuals. Moreover, adult cells are likely to have significant differences in the rates of synthesis and clearance that are influenced by intrinsic errors in protein expression, genetic polymorphisms, and fluctuations in physiological and environmental conditions. Here, we will address how protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is achieved at the level of the cell and organism, and how the threshold of the stress response is set to detect and combat protein misfolding. For metazoans, the requirement for coordinated function and growth imposes additional constraints on the detection, signaling, and response to misfolding, and requires that the HSR is integrated into various aspects of organismal physiology, such as lifespan. This is achieved by hierarchical regulation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) by the metabolic state of the cell and centralized neuronal control that could allow optimal resource allocation between cells and tissues. We will examine how protein folding quality control mechanisms in individual cells may be integrated into a multicellular level of control, and further, even custom-designed to support individual variability and impose additional constraints on evolutionary adaptation.",

Despite the determination of many native prion protein (PrP) structures and in vitro production of infectious prions from recombinant PrP the structural background of PrP conversion remains the largest unsolved problem. The aggregated state of PrPSc makes it inaccessible to high resolution techniques, therefore indirect methods have to be used to investigate the conversion process. We engineered disulfide bridges into the structured domain of PrP in order to determine the secondary structure elements that remain conserved upon conversion. Rather surprisingly, introduction of disulfides into each or both of the subdomains B1-H1-B2 and H2-H3 of the C-terminal globular domain retained the robust ability to convert into fibrils with increased content of β-structure, indistinguishable from the wild-type PrP. On the other hand disulfide bridges tethering the two subdomains completely prevented conversion, while their reduction reversed their conversion ability. The same conversion propensity was replicated also in prion infected cell lines. Experiments with combinations of engineered cysteine residues further support that domain swapping, centered on the B2-H2 loop, previously associated to species barrier, leads to PrP swapped dimers as the building block of prion fibrils.",PrP;prion protein;mPrP;murine prion protein;prion protein;structural conversion;disulfide crosslinks;secondary structure;domain swapping;rigid loop;dimer

From this research, it is clear that there is a complex interaction between the chromatin landscape and the general transcriptional machinery and that the dynamic control of this interface is central to gene regulation. However, the chromatin remodeling enzymes and general TFs cannot, on their own, recognize and stably bind to promoter or enhancer regions. Rather, they are recruited to cis regulatory regions through interaction with site-specific DNA binding TFs and/or proteins that recognize epigenetic marks such as methylated cytosines or specifically modified amino acids in histones. These “recruitment” factors are modular in structure, reflecting their ability to interact with the genome via one region of the protein and to simultaneously bind to other regulatory proteins via “effector” domains. In this chapter, we provide examples of common effector domains that can function in transcriptional regulation via their ability to (a) interact with the basal transcriptional machinery and general co-activators, (b) interact with other TFs to allow cooperative binding, and (c) directly or indirectly recruit histone and chromatin modifying enzymes.",

This process can be divided into two steps, in which the first is the polymerization of FtsZ to form the Z ring in the cytoplasm, and then the sequential addition of FtsA/ZipA to anchor the ring at the cytoplasmic membrane, a stage completed by FtsEX and FtsK. In the second step, the formation of the peptidoglycan synthesis machinery in the periplasm takes place, followed by cell division. The proteins involved in connecting both steps in cell division are FtsQ, FtsB and FtsL, and their interaction is a crucial and conserved event in the division of different bacteria. These components are small bitopic membrane proteins, and their specific function seems to be mainly structural. The purpose of this study was to obtain a structural model of the periplasmic part of the FtsB/FtsL/FtsQ complex, using bioinformatics tools and experimental data reported in the literature.",

In particular, we found that the diffusion time of a tracer fluorescent lipid through a confocal volume measured via fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is distributed over a wide range of timescales, indicating the formation of stable and/or transient membrane species that have different mobilities. A simple estimate, however, suggested that the slow diffusing species are too large to be attributed to AMP oligomers or pores that are tightly bound to a small number of lipids. Thus, we tentatively ascribed them to membrane domains and/or clusters that possess distinctively different diffusion properties. In order to further substantiate our previous conjecture, herein we study the diffusion behavior of the membrane-bound peptide molecules using the same AMPs and model membranes. Our results show, in contrast to our previous findings, that the diffusion times of the membrane-bound peptides exhibit a much narrower distribution that is more similar to that of the lipids in peptide-free membranes. Thus, taken together, these results indicate that while AMP molecules prompt domain formation in membranes, they are not tightly associated with the lipid domains thus formed. Instead, they are likely located at the boundary regions separating various domains and acting as mobile fences.",Membrane;Antimicrobial Peptide;Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy;Diffusion;Membrane Domain Formation

In this study, we investigate the conformations of Aβ(16-22) octamers in the absence and presence of a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) by performing extensive all-atom replica exchange molecular-dynamics simulations in explicit solvent. Our simulations starting from eight random chains demonstrate that the addition of SWCNT into Aβ(16-22) solution prevents β-sheet formation. Simulation starting from a prefibrillar β-sheet octamer shows that SWCNT destabilizes the β-sheet structure. A detailed analysis of the Aβ(16-22)/SWCNT/water interactions reveals that both the inhibition of β-sheet formation and the destabilization of prefibrillar β-sheets by SWCNT result from the same physical forces: hydrophobic and π-stacking interactions (with the latter playing a more important role). By analyzing the stacking patterns between the Phe aromatic rings and the SWCNT carbon rings, we find that short ring–centroid distances mostly favor parallel orientation, whereas large distances allow all other orientations to be populated. Overall, our computational study provides evidence that SWCNT is likely to inhibit Aβ(16-22) and full-length Aβ fibrillation.",

However, its deleterious effects independent of PrPSc have recently been observed not only in PrD but also in Alzheimer disease (AD), two diseases which mainly affect cognition. At the same time, PrPC itself seems to have broad physiologic functions including involvement in cognitive processes. The PrPC that is believed to be soluble and monomeric has so far been the only PrP conformer observed in the uninfected brain. In 2006, we identified an insoluble PrPC conformer (termed iPrPC) in uninfected human and animal brains. Remarkably, the PrPSc-like iPrPC shares the immunoreactivity behavior and fragmentation with a newly-identified PrPSc species in a novel human PrD termed variably protease-sensitive prionopathy. Moreover, iPrPC has been observed as the major PrP species that interacts with amyloid β (Aβ) in AD. This article highlights evidence of PrP involvement in two putatively beneficial and deleterious PrP-implicated pathways in cognition and hypothesizes first, that beneficial and deleterious effects of PrPC are attributable to the chameleon-like conformation of the protein and second, that the iPrPC conformer is associated with PrD and AD.",prion protein;prion disease;cognition;cognitive deficit;insoluble prion protein;Alzheimer disease;variably protease-sensitive prionopathy;dementia;memory

Although increasing evidence indicates that protein native states are highly protected against aggregation, the specific protection mechanisms are poorly understood. Insight into such mechanisms can be gained through study of the relatively few proteins that aggregate under native conditions. Ataxin-3, the protein responsible for Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, a polyglutamine expansion disease, represents one of such examples. Polyglutamine expansion is central for determining solubility and aggregation rates of ataxin-3, but these properties are profoundly modulated by its N-terminal Josephin domain. This work aims at identifying the regions that promote Josephin fibrillogenesis and rationalizing the mechanisms that protect Josephin and nonexpanded ataxin-3 from aberrant aggregation. Using different biophysical techniques, aggregation propensity predictions and rational design of amino acid substitutions, we show that Josephin has an intrinsic tendency to fibrillize under native conditions and that fibrillization is promoted by two solvent-exposed patches, which are also involved in recognition of natural substrates, such as ubiquitin. Indeed, designed mutations at these patches or substrate binding significantly reduce Josephin aggregation kinetics. Our results provide evidence that protein nonpathologic function can play an active role in preventing aberrant fibrillization and suggest the molecular mechanism whereby this occurs in ataxin-3.—Masino, L., Nicastro, G., Calder, L., Vendruscolo, M., Pastore, A.

E-mail: moc.oohay@edalsaed","Summary: Deinococcus radiodurans is a robust bacterium best known for its capacity to repair massive DNA damage efficiently and accurately. It is extremely resistant to many DNA-damaging agents, including ionizing radiation and UV radiation (100 to 295 nm), desiccation, and mitomycin C, which induce oxidative damage not only to DNA but also to all cellular macromolecules via the production of reactive oxygen species. The extreme resilience of D. radiodurans to oxidative stress is imparted synergistically by an efficient protection of proteins against oxidative stress and an efficient DNA repair mechanism, enhanced by functional redundancies in both systems. D. radiodurans assets for the prevention of and recovery from oxidative stress are extensively reviewed here. Radiation- and desiccation-resistant bacteria such as D. radiodurans have substantially lower protein oxidation levels than do sensitive bacteria but have similar yields of DNA double-strand breaks. These findings challenge the concept of DNA as the primary target of radiation toxicity while advancing protein damage, and the protection of proteins against oxidative damage, as a new paradigm of radiation toxicity and survival. The protection of DNA repair and other proteins against oxidative damage is imparted by enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant defense systems dominated by divalent manganese complexes. Given that oxidative stress caused by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species is associated with aging and cancer, a comprehensive outlook on D. radiodurans strategies of combating oxidative stress may open new avenues for antiaging and anticancer treatments. The study of the antioxidation protection in D. radiodurans is therefore of considerable potential interest for medicine and public health.",

Thus, methods are needed that preserve these interactions and provide information about them. In-cell NMR spectroscopy is an attractive method to study a protein’s behavior in cells because it may provide residue-level structural and dynamic information. Yet several factors limit the feasibility of protein NMR spectroscopy in cells, and among them slow rotational diffusion has emerged as the most important. In this paper, we seek to elucidate the causes of the dramatically slow protein tumbling in cells and in so doing to gain insight into how the intracellular viscosity and weak, transient interactions modulate protein mobility. To address these questions, we characterized the rotational diffusion of three model globular proteins in E. coli cells using 2D heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. These proteins have a similar molecular size and globular fold, but very different surface properties, and indeed, they show very different rotational diffusion in the E. coli intracellular environment. Our data are consistent with an intracellular viscosity approximately eight times that of water—too low to be a limiting factor to observing small globular proteins by in-cell NMR spectroscopy. Thus, we conclude that transient interactions with cytoplasmic components significantly and differentially affect the mobility of proteins and therefore their NMR detectability. Moreover, we suggest that an intricate interplay of total protein charge and hydrophobic interactions plays a key role in regulating these weak intermolecular interactions in cells.",anomalous diffusion;intracellular mobility;in-cell NMR;macromolecular crowding;protein association;transient protein-protein interactions

Amelogenin, the major extracellular matrix protein of dental enamel, regulates the formation of these crystalline arrays via cooperative interactions with forming mineral phase. Using cryoelectron microscopy, we demonstrate that amelogenin undergoes stepwise hierarchical self-assembly. Furthermore, our results indicate that interactions between amelogenin hydrophilic C-terminal telopeptides are essential for oligomer formation and for subsequent steps of hierarchical self-assembly. We further show that amelogenin assemblies stabilize mineral prenucleation clusters and guide their arrangement into linear chains that organize as parallel arrays. The prenucleation clusters subsequently fuse together to form needle-shaped mineral particles, leading to the formation of bundles of crystallites, the hallmark structural organization of the forming enamel at the nanoscale.

Comparison with free IgE-Fc (reported here at 1.9Å) shows that the antibody, which has a compact, bent structure prior to receptor engagement, becomes even more acutely bent in the complex.

Mutation/modification experiments of linker histone (LH) H1 suggest the importance of dynamic mechanisms for LH binding/dissociation, but the effects on chromatin's unfolding pathway remain unclear. Here we investigate the stretching response of chromatin fibers by mesoscale modeling to complement single-molecule experiments, and present various unfolding mechanisms for fibers with different nucleosome repeat lengths (NRLs) with/without LH that are fixed to their cores or bind/unbind dynamically with different affinities. Fiber softening occurs for long compared to short NRL (due to facile stacking rearrangements), dynamic compared to static LH/core binding as well as slow rather than fast dynamic LH rebinding (due to DNA stem destabilization), and low compared to high LH concentration (due to DNA stem inhibition). Heterogeneous superbead constructs—nucleosome clusters interspersed with extended fiber regions—emerge during unfolding of medium-NRL fibers and may be related to those observed experimentally. Our work suggests that fast and slow LH binding pools, present simultaneously in vivo, might act cooperatively to yield controlled fiber unfolding at low forces. Medium-NRL fibers with multiple dynamic LH pools offer both flexibility and selective DNA exposure, and may be evolutionarily suitable to regulate chromatin architecture and gene expression.",

NFAT proteins share two well-conserved regions, the regulatory domain and the DNA binding domain. The N- and C-terminal ends are transactivation sites and show less sequence similarity, whereas their molecular functions remain poorly understood. Here, we identified a transcriptional repressor, interferon regulatory factor 2 binding protein 2 (IRF-2BP2), which specifically interacts with the C-terminal domain of NFAT1 among the NFAT family members. IRF-2BP2 was described as a corepressor by inhibiting both enhancer-activated and basal transcription. Gene reporter assays demonstrated that IRF-2BP2 represses the NFAT1-dependent transactivation of NFAT-responsive promoters. The ectopic expression of IRF-2BP2 in CD4 T cells resulted in decreased interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-4 production, supporting a repressive function of IRF-2BP2 for NFAT target genes. Furthermore, NFAT1 and IRF-2BP2 colocalized in the nucleus in activated cells, and the mutation of a newly identified nuclear localization signal in the IRF-2BP2 rendered it cytoplasmic, abolishing its repressive effect on NFAT1 activity. Collectively, our data demonstrate that IRF-2BP2 is a negative regulator of the NFAT1 transcription factor and suggest that NFAT1 repression occurs at the transcriptional level.",

The thylakoid membrane protein Alb3 of Arabidopsis chloroplasts belongs to the evolutionarily conserved YidC/Oxa1/Alb3 protein family; the members of this family facilitate the insertion, folding, and assembly of membrane proteins in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. Here, we analyzed the interaction sites of full-length Alb3 with the cpSRP pathway component cpSRP43 by using in vitro and in vivo studies. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation and Alb3 proteoliposome studies showed that the interaction of cpSRP43 is dependent on a binding domain in the C terminus of Alb3 as well as an additional membrane-embedded binding site in the fifth transmembrane domain (TMD5) of Alb3. The C-terminal binding domain was mapped to residues 374–388, and the binding domain within TMD5 was mapped to residues 314–318 located close to the luminal end of TMD5. A direct binding between cpSRP43 and these binding motifs was shown by pepspot analysis. Further studies using blue-native gel electrophoresis revealed that full-length Alb3 is able to form dimers. This finding and the identification of a membrane-embedded cpSRP43 binding site in Alb3 support a model in which cpSRP43 inserts into a dimeric Alb3 translocation pore during cpSRP-dependent delivery of light-harvesting chlorophyll a,b-binding proteins.",Chloroplast;Membrane Proteins;Plant;Protein Translocation;Protein-Protein Interactions;YidC/Oxa1/Alb3 Protein Family;Light-harvesting Chlorophyll a;b-binding Proteins;Signal Recognition Particle;Thylakoid Membrane

Understanding how viruses hijack dynein and kinesin motors using a limited repertoire of proteins offers a great opportunity to determine the molecular basis of motor recruitment. In this review, we discuss the interactions of dynein and kinesin-1 with adenovirus, the α herpes viruses: herpes simplex virus (HSV1) and pseudorabies virus (PrV), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and vaccinia virus. We highlight where the molecular links to these opposite polarity motors have been defined and discuss the difficulties associated with identifying viral binding partners where the basis of motor recruitment remains to be established.

Human serum albumin, spin-labeled fatty acids, and Cu(II) protoporphyrin IX—a hemin analog—form a fully self-assembled system that allows obtaining distances and mutual orientations between the paramagnetic guest molecules. We report a simplified analysis for the orientation-selective DEER data which can be applied when the orientation selection of one spin in the spin pair dominates the orientation selection of the other spin. The dipolar spectra reveal a dominant distance of 3.85 nm and a dominant orientation of the spin-spin vectors between Cu(II) protoporphyrin IX and 16-doxyl stearic acid, the electron paramagnetic resonance reporter group of the latter being located near the entry points to the fatty acid binding sites. This observation is in contrast to crystallographic data that suggest an asymmetric distribution of the entry points in the protein and hence the occurrence of various distances. In conjunction with the findings of a recent DEER study, the obtained data are indicative of a symmetric distribution of the binding site entries on the protein's surface. The overall anisotropic shape of the protein is reflected by one spin-spin vector orientation dominating the DEER data.",

During past decades, it has become evident that the deformable cytoskeleton (CSK), an intracellular network of various filamentous biopolymers, provides a physical basis for transducing mechanical signals into biochemical responses. To understand how mechanical forces regulate cellular functions, it is necessary to first understand how the CSK develops mechanical stresses in response to applied forces, and how those stresses are propagated through the CSK where various signaling molecules are immobilized. New experimental techniques have been developed to quantify cytoskeletal mechanics, which together with new computational approaches have given rise to new theories and models for describing mechanics of living cells. In this article, we discuss current understanding of cell biomechanics by focusing on the biophysical mechanisms that are responsible for the development and transmission of mechanical stresses in the cell and their effect on cellular functions. We compare and contrast various theories and models of cytoskeletal mechanics, emphasizing common mechanisms that those theories are built upon, while not ignoring irreconcilable differences. We highlight most recent advances in the understanding of mechanotransduction in the cytoplasm of living cells and the central role of the cytoskeletal prestress in propagating mechanical forces along the cytoskeletal filaments to activate cytoplasmic enzymes. It is anticipated that advances in cell mechanics will help developing novel therapeutics to treat pulmonary diseases like asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",

First-pass attempts to explain the glutamate-elicited currents with mathematical models produced reaction mechanisms that included only the most basic functionally defined states: resting vs. liganded, closed vs. open, responsive vs. desensitized. In contrast, single-molecule observations afforded by the patch-clamp technique revealed an unanticipated kinetic multiplicity of transitions: from microseconds-lasting flickers to minutes-long modes. How these kinetically defined events impact the shape of the synaptic response, how they relate to rearrangements in receptor structure, and whether and how they are physiologically controlled represent currently active research directions. Modal gating, which refers to the slowest, least frequently observed ion-channel transitions, has been demonstrated for representatives of all ion channel families. However, reaction schemes have been largely confined to the short- and medium-range time scales. For glutamate receptors as well, modal gating has only recently come under rigorous scrutiny. This article reviews the evidence for modal gating of glutamate receptors and the still developing hypotheses about the mechanism(s) by which modal shifts occur and the ways in which they may impact the time course of synaptic transmission.",

The concerted action of calponin homology (CH), linker, and C-terminal domains of EBs is important for their autonomous microtubule tip tracking, regulation of microtubule dynamics, and recruitment of numerous partners to microtubule ends. Here we report the detailed structural and biochemical analysis of mammalian EBs. Small-angle X-ray scattering, electron microscopy, and chemical cross-linking in combination with mass spectrometry indicate that EBs are elongated molecules with two interacting CH domains, an arrangement reminiscent of that seen in other microtubule- and actin-binding proteins. Removal of the negatively charged C-terminal tail did not affect the overall conformation of EBs; however, it increased the dwell times of EBs on the microtubule lattice in microtubule tip–tracking reconstitution experiments. An even more stable association with the microtubule lattice was observed when the entire negatively charged C-terminal domain of EBs was replaced by a neutral coiled-coil motif. In contrast, the interaction of EBs with growing microtubule tips was not significantly affected by these C-terminal domain mutations. Our data indicate that long-range electrostatic repulsive interactions between the C-terminus and the microtubule lattice drive the specificity of EBs for growing microtubule ends.",

GRKs phosphorylate activated receptors and promote high affinity binding of arrestins, which precludes G protein coupling. GRKs have a multidomain structure, with the kinase domain inserted into a loop of a regulator of G protein signaling homology domain. Unlike many other kinases, GRKs do not need to be phosphorylated in their activation loop to achieve an activated state. Instead, they are directly activated by docking with active GPCRs. In this manner they are able to selectively phosphorylate Ser/Thr residues on only the activated form of the receptor, unlike related kinases such as protein kinase A. GRKs also phosphorylate a variety of non-GPCR substrates and regulate several signaling pathways via direct interactions with other proteins in a phosphorylation-independent manner. Multiple GRK subtypes are present in virtually every animal cell, with the highest expression levels found in neurons, with their extensive and complex signal regulation. Insufficient or excessive GRK activity was implicated in a variety of human disorders, ranging from heart failure to depression to Parkinson’s disease. As key regulators of GPCR-dependent and -independent signaling pathways, GRKs are emerging drug targets and promising molecular tools for therapy. Targeted modulation of expression and/or of activity of several GRK isoforms for therapeutic purposes was recently validated in cardiac disorders and Parkinson’s disease.",G protein-coupled receptors;G protein-coupled receptor kinases;signaling;regulation;phosphorylation;G proteins;regulator of G protein signaling

The phosphorylation of viral proteins is known to play a role in genome transcription and replication in paramyxoviruses. The paramyxovirus nucleoprotein (N), the most abundant protein in infected cells, is a component of the N–RNA complex and supports the transcription and replication of virus mRNA and genomic RNA. Recently, we reported that the phosphorylation of measles virus N is involved in the regulation of viral RNA synthesis. In this study, we report a rapid turnover of phosphorylation in the Nipah virus N (NiV-N). The phosphorylated NiV-N was hardly detectable in steady-state cells, but was detected after inhibition of cellular protein phosphatases. We identified a phosphorylated serine residue at Ser451 of NiV-N by peptide mass fingerprinting by electrospray ionization–quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In the NiV minigenome assay, using luciferase as a reporter gene, the substitution of Ser451 for alanine in NiV-N resulted in a reduction in luciferase activity of approximately 45 % compared with the wild-type protein. Furthermore, the substitution of Ser451 for glutamic acid, which mimics a phosphoserine, led to a more significant decrease in luciferase activity – approximately 81 %. Northern blot analysis showed that both virus transcription and replication were reduced by these mutations. These results suggest that a rapid turnover of the phosphorylation of NiV-N plays an important role in virus transcription and replication.",

As with all nucleation and growth phenomena, it is difficult to track individual nuclei in traditional macroscopic experiments, which probe the overall temporal evolution of the sample, but do not yield detailed information on the primary nucleation step as they mix independent stochastic events into an ensemble measurement. To overcome this limitation, we have developed microdroplet assays enabling us to detect single primary nucleation events and to monitor their subsequent spatial as well as temporal evolution, both of which we find to be determined by secondary nucleation phenomena. By deforming the droplets to high aspect ratio, we visualize in real-time propagating waves of protein assembly emanating from discrete primary nucleation sites. We show that, in contrast to classical gelation phenomena, the primary nucleation step is characterized by a striking dependence on system size, and the filamentous protein self-assembly process involves a highly nonuniform spatial distribution of aggregates. These findings deviate markedly from the current picture of amyloid growth and uncover a general driving force, originating from confinement, which, together with biological quality control mechanisms, helps proteins remain soluble and therefore functional in nature.",microfluidics;reaction front;filamentous growth;insulin;protein misfolding

Growing hand, foot and mouth disease outbreaks were observed worldwide in recent years and caused devastating losses both economically and politically. However, vaccines or effective drugs are unavailable to date. The genome of EV71 consists of a positive sense, single-stranded RNA of ∼ 7400 bp, encoding a large precursor polyprotein that requires proteolytic processing to generate mature viral proteins. The proteolytic processing mainly depends on EV71 3C protease (3Cpro) that possesses both proteolysis and RNA binding activities, which enable the protease to perform multiple tasks in viral replication and pathogen–host interactions. The central roles played by EV71 3Cpro make it an appealing target for antiviral drug development. We determined the first crystal structure of EV71 3Cpro and analyzed its enzymatic activity. The crystal structure shows that EV71 3Cpro has a typical chymotrypsin-like fold that is common in picornaviral 3Cpro. Strikingly, we found an important surface loop, also denoted as β-ribbon, which adopts a novel open conformation in EV71 3Cpro. We identified two important residues located at the base of the β-ribbon, Gly123 and His133, which form hinges that govern the intrinsic flexibility of the ribbon. Structure-guided mutagenesis studies revealed that the hinge residues are important to EV71 3Cpro proteolytic activities. In summary, our work provides the first structural insight into EV71 3Cpro, including a mobile β-ribbon, which is relevant to the proteolytic mechanism. Our data also provides a framework for structure-guided inhibitor design against EV71 3Cpro.",EV71;human enterovirus 71; HFMD;hand;foot and mouth disease; 3Cpro;3C protease; FMDV;foot-and-mouth disease virus; HAV;hepatitis A virus; PV;poliovirus; HRV;human rhinovirus; CVB;coxsackievirus B; ASU;asymmetric unit; SARS-CoV;severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus; WT;wild-type; PDB;Protein Data Bank; SLS;Swiss Light Source

It is the most complex compartment of the vessel wall and comprises a variety of cells including fibroblasts, immunomodulatory cells, resident progenitor cells, vasa vasorum endothelial cells, and adrenergic nerves. In response to vascular stress or injury, resident adventitial cells are often the first to be activated and reprogrammed to then influence tone and structure of the vessel wall. Experimental data indicate that the adventitial fibroblast, the most abundant cellular constituent of adventitia, is a critical regulator of vascular wall function. In response to vascular stresses such as overdistension, hypoxia, or infection, the adventitial fibroblast is activated and undergoes phenotypic changes that include proliferation, differentiation, and production of extracellular matrix proteins and adhesion molecules, release of reactive oxygen species, chemokines, cytokines, growth factors, and metalloproteinases that, collectively, affect medial smooth muscle cell tone and growth directly and that stimulate recruitment and retention of circulating inflammatory and progenitor cells to the vessel wall. Resident dendritic cells also participate in “sensing” vascular stress and actively communicate with fibroblasts and progenitor cells to simulate repair processes that involve expansion of the vasa vasorum, which acts as a conduit for further delivery of inflammatory/progenitor cells. This review presents the current evidence demonstrating that the adventitia acts as a key regulator of pulmonary vascular wall function and structure from the “outside in.”",

Although there is no overall sequence homology to the cellular prion protein (PrPC), both proteins contain a highly conserved internal hydrophobic domain (HD) and are tethered to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane via a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. A previous study revealed that Sho can reduce toxicity of a PrP mutant devoid of the HD (PrPΔHD). We have now studied the stress-protective activity of Sho in detail and identified domains involved in this activity. Like PrPC, Sho protects cells against physiological stressors such as the excitotoxin glutamate. Moreover, both PrPC and Sho required the N-terminal domain for this activity; the stress-protective capacity of PrPΔN as well as ShoΔN was significantly impaired. In both proteins, the HD promoted homodimer formation; however, deletion of the HD had different effects. Although ShoΔHD lost its stress-protective activity, PrPΔHD acquired a neurotoxic potential. Finally, we could show that the N-terminal domain of PrPC could be functionally replaced by that of Sho, suggesting a similar function of the N termini of Sho and PrPC. Our study reveals a conserved physiological activity between PrPC and Sho to protect cells from stress-induced toxicity and suggests that Sho and PrPC might act on similar signaling pathways.",Glutamate Receptors Ionotropic (AMPA;NMDA); Neurodegeneration; Phosphatidylinositol Anchor; Prions; Signal Transduction; Shadoo; Stress Protection

Alpha4 is one such regulatory protein that binds the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) and protects it from polyubiquitination and degradation. Alpha4 is a multidomain protein with a C-terminal domain that binds Mid1, a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase, and an N-terminal domain containing the PP2Ac-binding site. In this work, we present the structure of the N-terminal domain of mammalian Alpha4 determined by x-ray crystallography and use double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy to show that it is a flexible tetratricopeptide repeat-like protein. Structurally, Alpha4 differs from its yeast homolog, Tap42, in two important ways: 1) the position of the helix containing the PP2Ac-binding residues is in a more open conformation, showing flexibility in this region; and 2) Alpha4 contains a ubiquitin-interacting motif. The effects of wild-type and mutant Alpha4 on PP2Ac ubiquitination and stability were examined in mammalian cells by performing tandem ubiquitin-binding entity precipitations and cycloheximide chase experiments.

Interestingly, however, an increasing number of studies suggest that amyloid structures can sometimes play a functional role in normal biology. Several proteins form self-propagating amyloids called prions in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These unique elements operate by creating a reversible, epigenetic change in phenotype. While the function of the non-prion conformation of the Rnq1 protein is unclear, the prion form, [RNQ+], acts to facilitate the de novo formation of other prions to influence cellular phenotypes. The [RNQ+] prion itself does not adversely affect the growth of yeast, but the overexpression of Rnq1p can form toxic aggregated structures that are not necessarily prions. The [RNQ+] prion is also involved in dictating the aggregation and toxicity of polyglutamine proteins ectopically expressed in yeast.

The former two classes are known to have some structural and physicochemical similarities, but fusogenic peptides tend to have rather different features and sequences. Nevertheless, we found that many CPPs and some AMPs exhibit a pronounced fusogenic activity, as measured by a lipid mixing assay with vesicles composed of typical eukaryotic lipids. Compared to the HIV fusion peptide (FP23) as a representative standard, all designer-made peptides showed much higher lipid-mixing activities (MSI-103, MAP, transportan, penetratin, Pep1). Native sequences, on the other hand, were less fusogenic (magainin 2, PGLa, gramicidin S), and pre-aggregated ones were inactive (alamethicin, SAP). The peptide structures were characterized by circular dichroism before and after interacting with the lipid vesicles. A striking correlation between the extent of conformational change and the respective fusion activities was found for the series of peptides investigated here. At the same time, the CD data show that lipid mixing can be triggered by any type of conformation acquired upon binding, whether α-helical, β-stranded, or other. These observations suggest that lipid vesicle fusion can simply be driven by the energy released upon membrane binding, peptide folding, and possibly further aggregation. This comparative study of AMPs, CPPs, and FPs emphasizes the multifunctional aspects of membrane-active peptides, and it suggests that the origin of a peptide (native sequence or designer-made) may be more relevant to define its functional range than any given name.",Membrane-active peptides;Lipid-mixing;Membrane fusion;Circular dichroism;Conformational changes;Designer-made sequences;Peptide-lipid interactions

The centromere is marked by a conserved variant of conventional histone H3 termed CenH3 or CENP-A2. A conserved motif of CenH3, the CATD, defined by loop 1 and helix 2 of the histone fold, is necessary and sufficient for specifying centromere functions of CenH33, 4. The structural basis of this specification is of outstanding interest. Yeast Scm3 and human HJURP are conserved nonhistone proteins that interact physically with the (CenH3-H4)2 heterotetramer and are required for the deposition of CenH3 at centromeres in vivo5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Here we have elucidated the structural basis for recognition of budding yeast CenH3 (Cse4) by Scm3. We solved the structure of the Cse4-binding domain (CBD) of Scm3 complexed with Cse4 and H4 in a single chain model. An α-helix and an irregular loop at the conserved N-terminus and a shorter α-helix at the C-terminus of Scm3-CBD wraps around the Cse4-H4 dimer. Four Cse4-specific residues in the N-terminal region of helix 2 are sufficient for specific recognition by conserved and functionally important residues in the N-terminal helix of Scm3 through formation of a hydrophobic cluster. Scm3-CBD induces major conformational changes and sterically occludes DNA binding sites in the structure of Cse4 and H4.

Unlike soluble serine proteases such as chymotrypsin, the active site of rhomboid protease, which contains a Ser-His catalytic dyad, is submerged in the membrane and surrounded by membrane-spanning helices. Previous crystallographic analyses of GlpG, a bacterial rhomboid protease, and its complex with isocoumarin have provided insights into the mechanism of the membrane protease. Here, we studied the interaction of GlpG with 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin and diisopropyl fluorophosphonate, both mechanism-based inhibitors for the serine protease, and describe the crystal structure of the covalent adduct between GlpG and diisopropyl fluorophosphonate, which mimics the oxyanion-containing tetrahedral intermediate of the hydrolytic reaction. The crystal structure confirms that the oxyanion is stabilized by the main chain amide of Ser-201 and by the side chains of His-150 and Asn-154. The phosphorylation of the catalytic Ser-201 weakens its interaction with His-254, causing the catalytic histidine to rotate away from the serine. The rotation of His-254 is accompanied by further rearrangement of the side chains of Tyr-205 and Trp-236 within the substrate-binding groove. The formation of the tetrahedral adduct is also accompanied by opening of the L5 cap and movement of transmembrane helix S5 toward S6 in a direction different from that predicted by the lateral gating model.

The selection of new CPPs with desired capabilities from randomized peptide libraries is challenging, since the CPP phenotype is a complex selection target. Here we report the discovery of an unusual new CPP from a randomized peptide library using a functional selection system based on plasmid display (PD). After four rounds of screening of a 14-mer peptide library over PC12 cells, several peptides were identified and tested for their ability to deliver the green fluorescent protein (GFP). One peptide (SG3) exhibited a cell penetrating phenotype, however unlike other well-known CPPs such as TAT or Penetratin, the newly identified peptide was not highly cationic. The PD protocol necessitated the addition of a cationic lipid (Lipofectamine2000), and in the presence of this compound, the SG3 peptide significantly outperformed the well-known TAT CPP in the delivery of GFP to PC12 cells and primary astrocytes.

Physiologically, αS undergoes a transition from a random coil to helical conformation upon encountering synaptic vesicle membranes. On analogous small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), the conformation of αS is dominated by a single elongated αS helix. However, alternative broken helix states have been postulated, mandating experimental clarification. Here, the upper limit for the free energy difference between elongated and broken helix conformations on SUVs resembling synaptic vesicles was determined to be 1.2 ± 0.4 kcal/mol, which amounts to a population ratio of 7.6:1 between both states (12% broken helices). In response to helix breaks at different positions, αS rearranged in an opportunistic manner, thereby minimizing helix abrogations to as little as one to two turns. Enthalpy and entropy measurements of gel state SUV-αS interactions indicated that broken helix states retain the ability to relieve membrane-packing stress. Thus, broken helix states are a distinct physiological feature of the vesicle-bound αS state, making it a “checkered” protein of multiple parallel conformations. A continuous interconversion between structural states may contribute to pathological αS misfolding.",Amyloid;Biophysics;Membrane Proteins;Protein Folding;Synuclein;Protein-Membrane Interaction

The polyanion, heparin, is commonly used as an inducer in studies of Tau aggregation in vitro, but there is surprisingly no comprehensive model describing, quantitatively, all aspects of the heparin-induced aggregation reaction. In this study, rate constants and extents of fibril formation by the four repeat domain of Tau (Tau4RD) have been reproducibly determined over a full range of heparin and protein concentrations. The kinetic role of heparin in the nucleation-dependent fibril formation reaction is shown to be limited to participation in the initial rate-limiting steps; a single heparin molecule binds two Tau4RD molecules, forming an aggregation-competent protein dimer, which then serves as a building block for further fibril growth. Importantly, the minimal kinetic model that is proposed can quantitatively account for the characteristic bell-shaped dependence of the aggregation kinetics on the stoichiometry of protein to heparin. Very importantly, this study also identifies for the first time short and thin, rod-like protofibrils that are populated transiently, early during the time course of fibril formation. The identification of these protofibrils as bona fide off-pathway species has implications for the development of therapies for tauopathies based on driving fibril formation as a means of protecting the cell from smaller, putatively toxic aggregates.",Amyloid;Atomic Force Microscopy;Heparin;Kinetics;Neurodegenerative Diseases;Tau;Thioflavin T

All members of the R7 RGS form trimeric complexes with the atypical G protein β subunit, Gβ5, and membrane anchor R7BP or R9AP. Association with Gβ5 and membrane anchors has been shown to be critical for maintaining proteolytic stability of the R7 RGS proteins. However, despite its functional importance, the mechanism of how R7 RGS forms complexes with Gβ5 and membrane anchors remains poorly understood. Here, we used protein-protein interaction, co-localization, and protein stability assays to show that association of RGS9 with membrane anchors requires Gβ5. We further establish that the recruitment of R7BP to the complex requires an intact interface between the N-terminal lobe of RGS9 and protein interaction surface of Gβ5. Site-directed mutational analysis reveals that distinct molecular determinants in the interface between Gβ5 and N-terminal Dishevelled, EGL-10, Pleckstrin/DEP Helical Extension (DEP/DHEY) domains are differentially involved in R7BP binding and proteolytic stabilization. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that Gβ5 contributes to the formation of the binding site to the membrane anchors and thus is playing a central role in the assembly of the proteolytically stable trimeric complex and its correct localization in the cell.",Adaptor Proteins;Cell Surface Receptor;G Protein-coupled Receptors (GPCR);G Proteins;Heterotrimeric G Proteins;Neuroscience;Protein Assembly;Protein Stability;Signal Transduction;RGS Proteins

For example, peptidylarginine deminase 4 (PAD4) converts peptidyl arginine to citrulline in histone H3 and can repress gene expression. However, regulation of gene expression through citrullination of non-histone proteins is less well defined. Herein, we identify a tumor suppressor protein, inhibitor of growth 4 (ING4), as a novel non-histone substrate of PAD4. ING4 is known to bind p53 via its nuclear localization signal (NLS) region and to enhance transcriptional activity of p53. We show that PAD4 preferentially citrullinates ING4 in the same NLS region and thereby disrupts the interaction between ING4 and p53. A citrulline-mimicking Arg-NLS-Gln ING4 mutant, which has all Arg residues in the NLS mutated to Gln, loses its affinity for p53, can no longer promote p53 acetylation, and results in repression of downstream p21 expression. In addition, we found that citrullination leads to increased susceptibility of ING4 to degradation, likely impacting p53-independent pathways as well. These findings elucidate an interaction between posttranslational citrullination, acetylation, and methylation and highlight an unusual mechanism whereby citrullination of a non-histone protein impacts gene regulation.",Enzymes;Gene Expression;Histone Modification;p53;Post-translational Modification;Protein Degradation;Protein Domains;Citrullination

For example, Hsp90 inhibitors can reduce the levels of tau in transgenic mouse models of tauopathy. Because of this, we hypothesized that a number of Hsp90 accessory proteins, termed co-chaperones, could also affect tau stability. Perhaps by identifying these co-chaperones, new therapeutics could be designed to specifically target these proteins and facilitate tau clearance. Here, we report that the co-chaperone Cdc37 can regulate aspects of tau pathogenesis. We found that suppression of Cdc37 destabilized tau, leading to its clearance, whereas Cdc37 overexpression preserved tau. Cdc37 was found to co-localize with tau in neuronal cells and to physically interact with tau from human brain. Moreover, Cdc37 levels significantly increased with age. Cdc37 knockdown altered the phosphorylation profile of tau, an effect that was due in part to reduced tau kinase stability, specifically Cdk5 and Akt. Conversely, GSK3β and Mark2 were unaffected by Cdc37 modulation. Cdc37 overexpression prevented whereas Cdc37 suppression potentiated tau clearance following Hsp90 inhibition. Thus, Cdc37 can regulate tau in two ways: by directly stabilizing it via Hsp90 and by regulating the stability of distinct tau kinases. We propose that changes in the neuronal levels or activity of Cdc37 could dramatically alter the kinome, leading to profound changes in the tau phosphorylation signature, altering its proteotoxicity and stability.",Alzheimer Disease;Chaperone Chaperonin;Heat Shock Protein;Protein Kinases;Tau

Binding of pRb to a construct containing the LXCXE motif and the J domainrevealed weak interactions between pRb and the J domain. Analysis of the complex of pRb and N260indicated that the OBD is not involved and retains its dynamic independencefrom the remainder of Tag.

Like many proteins involved in copper homeostasis, CueO has a methionine-rich segment that is thought to be critical for copper handling. How such segments function is poorly understood. Here, we report the crystal structure of CueO at 1.1 Å with the 45-residue methionine-rich segment fully resolved, revealing an N-terminal helical segment with methionine residues juxtaposed for Cu(I) ligation and a C-terminal highly mobile segment rich in methionine and histidine residues. We also report structures of CueO with a C500S mutation, which leads to loss of the T1 copper, and CueO with six methionines changed to serine. Soaking C500S CueO crystals with Cu(I), or wild-type CueO crystals with Ag(I), leads to occupancy of three sites, the previously identified substrate-binding site and two new sites along the methionine-rich helix, involving methionines 358, 362, 368, and 376. Mutation of these residues leads to a ∼4-fold reduction in kcat for Cu(I) oxidation. Ag(I), which often appears with copper in nature, strongly inhibits CueO oxidase activities in vitro and compromises copper tolerance in vivo, particularly in the absence of the complementary copper efflux cus system.

We have used NMR to investigate the interaction of Pin1 with three related ligands that include a pS-P substrate peptide, and two pS-P substrate analogue inhibitors locked in the cis and trans conformations. Specifically, we compared the ligand binding modes and binding-induced changes in Pin1 side-chain flexibility. The cis and trans binding modes differ, and produce different mobility in Pin1. The cis-locked inhibitor and substrate produced a loss of side-chain flexibility along an internal conduit of conserved hydrophobic residues, connecting the domain interface with the isomerase active site. The trans-locked inhibitor produces a weaker conduit response. Thus, the conduit response is stereoselective. We further show interactions between the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase and Trp-Trp (WW) domains amplify the conduit response, and alter binding properties at the remote peptidyl-prolyl isomerase active site. These results suggest that specific input conformations can gate dynamic changes that support intraprotein communication.

Despite its important roles, DYNLL1's own regulation remains poorly understood. Here we identify ASCIZ (ATMIN/ZNF822), an essential Zn2+ finger protein with dual roles in the DNA base damage response and as a developmental transcription factor, as a conserved regulator of Dynll1 gene expression. DYNLL1 levels are reduced by ∼10-fold in the absence of ASCIZ in human, mouse and chicken cells. ASCIZ binds directly to the Dynll1 promoter and regulates its activity in a Zn2+ finger-dependent manner. DYNLL1 protein in turn interacts with ten binding sites in the ASCIZ transcription activation domain, and high DYNLL1 levels inhibit the transcriptional activity of ASCIZ. In addition, DYNLL1 was also required for DNA damage-induced ASCIZ focus formation. The dual ability of ASCIZ to activate Dynll1 gene expression and to sense free DYNLL1 protein levels enables a simple dynamic feedback loop to adjust DYNLL1 levels to cellular needs.

To characterize the genetic basis of phenotypic evolution, numerous studies have identified individual genes that have likely evolved under natural selection. However, phenotypic changes may represent the cumulative effect of similar evolutionary forces acting on functionally related groups of genes. Phylogenetic analyses of divergent yeast species have identified functional groups of genes that have evolved at significantly different rates, suggestive of differential selection on the functional properties. However, due to environmental heterogeneity over long evolutionary timescales, selection operating within a single lineage may be dramatically different, and it is not detectable via interspecific comparisons alone. Moreover, interspecific studies typically quantify selection on protein-coding regions using the Dn/Ds ratio, which cannot be extended easily to study selection on noncoding regions or synonymous sites. The population genetic-based analysis of selection operating within a single lineage ameliorates these limitations. Findings. We investigated selection on several properties associated with genes, promoters, or polymorphic sites, by analyzing the derived allele frequency spectrum of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 28 strains of Saccharomyces paradoxus. We found evidence for significant differential selection between many functionally relevant categories of SNPs, underscoring the utility of function-centric approaches for discovering signatures of natural selection. When comparable, our findings are largely consistent with previous studies based on interspecific comparisons, with one notable exception: our study finds that mutations from an ancient amino acid to a relatively new amino acid are selectively disfavored, whereas interspecific comparisons have found selection against ancient amino acids. Several of our findings have not been addressed through prior interspecific studies: we find that synonymous mutations from preferred to unpreferred codons are selected against and that synonymous SNPs in the linker regions of proteins are relatively less constrained than those within protein domains. Conclusions. We present the first global survey of selection acting on various functional properties in S. paradoxus. We found that selection pressures previously detected over long evolutionary timescales have also shaped the evolution of S. paradoxus. Importantly, we also make novel discoveries untenable via conventional interspecific analyses.",evolution;natural selection;yeast;derived allele frequency

An in vitro biochemical assay plays a critical role in studying this process. The lack of such an assay system in plants hampered the study of plant mRNA 3′-end formation for the last two decades. To address this, we have now established and characterized a plant in vitro cleavage assay system, in which nuclear protein extracts from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) suspension cell cultures can accurately cleave different pre-mRNAs at expected in vivo authenticated poly(A) sites. The specific activity is dependent on appropriate cis-elements on the substrate RNA. When complemented by yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) poly(A) polymerase, about 150-nucleotide poly(A) tracts were added specifically to the newly cleaved 3′ ends in a cooperative manner. The reconstituted polyadenylation reaction is indicative that authentic cleavage products were generated. Our results not only provide a novel plant pre-mRNA cleavage assay system, but also suggest a cross-kingdom functional complementation of yeast poly(A) polymerase in a plant system.",

It is defined by a depletion of states that lie energetically between folded and unfolded conformations. There are different ways to test for two-state cooperativity; however, most of these approaches probe indirect proxies of this depletion. Generalized-ensemble computer simulations allow us to unambiguously identify this transition by a microcanonical analysis on the basis of the density of states. Here, we present a detailed characterization of several helical peptides obtained by coarse-grained simulations. The level of resolution of the coarse-grained model allowed to study realistic structures ranging from small α-helices to a de novo three-helix bundle without biasing the force field toward the native state of the protein. By linking thermodynamic and structural features, we are able to show that whereas short α-helices exhibit two-state cooperativity, the type of transition changes for longer chain lengths because the chain forms multiple helix nucleation sites, stabilizing a significant population of intermediate states. The helix bundle exhibits signs of two-state cooperativity owing to favorable helix-helix interactions, as predicted from theoretical models. A detailed analysis of secondary and tertiary structure formation fits well into the framework of several folding mechanisms and confirms features that up to now have been observed only in lattice models.",

Accessory proteins known as recombination mediators are required for the formation of the active presynaptic filament. One such mediator in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is the Swi5-Sfr1 complex, which has been identified as an activator of Rad51 that assists in presynaptic filament formation and stimulates its strand exchange reaction. Here, we determined the 1:1 binding stoichiometry between the two subunits of the Swi5-Sfr1 complex using analytical ultracentrifugation and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Small-angle x-ray scattering experiments revealed that the Swi5-Sfr1 complex displays an extremely elongated dogleg-shaped structure in solution, which is consistent with its exceptionally high frictional ratio (f/f0) of 2.0 ± 0.2 obtained by analytical ultracentrifugation. Furthermore, we determined a rough topology of the complex by comparing the small-angle x-ray scattering-based structures of the Swi5-Sfr1 complex and four Swi5-Sfr1-Fab complexes, in which the Fab fragments of monoclonal antibodies were specifically bound to experimentally determined sites of Sfr1.

This behavior is believed to have functional significance in a number of essential pathways, such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which involve dramatic membrane remodeling and require the recruitment of various cofactors at different stages of the process. This work is motivated in part by recent experiments that demonstrated that the amphipathic N-terminal helix of endophilin (H0) targets curved membranes by binding to hydrophobic lipid bilayer packing defects which increase in number with increasing membrane curvature. Here we use state-of-the-art atomistic simulation to explore the packing defect structure of curved membranes, and the effect of this structure on the folding of H0. We find that not only are packing defects increased in number with increasing membrane curvature, but also that their size distribution depends nontrivially on the curvature, falling off exponentially with a decay constant that depends on the curvature, and crucially that even on highly curved membranes defects large enough to accommodate the hydrophobic face of H0 are never observed. We furthermore find that a percolation model for the defects explains the defect size distribution, which implies that larger defects are formed by coalescence of noninteracting smaller defects. We also use the recently developed metadynamics algorithm to study in detail the effect of such defects on H0 folding. It is found that the comparatively larger defects found on a convex membrane promote H0 folding by several kcal/mol, while the smaller defects found on flat and concave membrane surfaces inhibit folding by kinetically trapping the peptide. Together, these observations suggest H0 folding is a cooperative process in which the folding peptide changes the defect structure relative to an unperturbed membrane.",

However, less than 300 unique membrane protein structures have been determined to date, often due to difficulties associated with the growth of sufficiently large and well-ordered crystals. This work has been focused on showing the first proof of concept for using membrane protein nanocrystals and microcrystals for high-resolution structure determination. Upon determining that crystals of the membrane protein Photosystem I, which is the largest and most complex membrane protein crystallized to date, exist with only a hundred unit cells with sizes of less than 200 nm on an edge, work was done to develop a technique that could exploit the growth of the Photosystem I nanocrystals and microcrystals. Femtosecond X-ray protein nanocrystallography was developed for use at the first high-energy X-ray free electron laser, the LCLS at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, in which a liquid jet brought fully-hydrated Photosystem I nanocrystals into the interaction region of the pulsed X-ray source. Diffraction patterns were recorded from millions of individual PSI nanocrystals and data from thousands of different, randomly oriented crystallites were integrated using Monte Carlo integration of the peak intensities. The short pulses (~ 70 fs) provided by the LCLS allowed the possibility to collect the diffraction data before the onset of radiation damage, exploiting the diffract-before-destroy principle. During the initial experiments at the AMO beamline using 6.9-Å wavelength, Bragg peaks were recorded to 8.5-Å resolution, and an electron-density map was determined that did not show any effects of X-ray-induced radiation damage [Chapman H.N., et al. Femtosecond X-ray protein nanocrystallography, Nature 470 (2011) 73–81]. Many additional techniques still need to be developed to explore the femtosecond nanocrystallography technique for experimental phasing and time-resolved X-ray crystallography experiments. The first proof-of-principle results for the femtosecond nanocrystallography technique indicate the incredible potential of the technique to offer a new route to the structure determination of membrane proteins.",membrane proteins;structure determination;femtosecond nanocrystallography;protein nanocrystals;X-ray crystallography;XFEL

We examined the localization of the C- and N-terminal domain of Nup98 by immunogold-labeling using domain-specific antibodies against Nup98 and by expressing epitope tagged versions of Nup98. Our studies revealed that anchorage of Nup98 to NPCs through its C-terminal autoproteolytic domain occurs in the center of the NPC, whereas its N-terminal GLFG domain is more flexible and is detected at multiple locations within the NPC. Additionally, we have confirmed the central localization of Nup98 within the NPC using super resolution structured illumination fluorescence microscopy (SIM) to position Nup98 domains relative to markers of cytoplasmic filaments and the nuclear basket.

An ensemble of at least six structures, comprising an equally populated mixture of closed and open conformations, was necessary to fit all of the data. This structural ensemble was cross-validated against single-molecule FRET spectroscopy, which suggested the presence of a continuum of open states. ESCRT-I in solution thus appears to consist of an approximately 50% population of one or a few related closed conformations, with the other 50% populating a continuum of open conformations.

In the unphosphorylated form, PLN binds SERCA and inhibits Ca2+ flux. Upon phosphorylation of PLN at Ser16, the inhibitory effect is reversed. Although structural details on both proteins are emerging from X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and NMR studies, the molecular mechanisms of their interactions and regulatory process are still lacking. It has been speculated that SERCA regulation depends on PLN structural transitions (order to disorder, i.e., folding/unfolding). Here, we investigated PLN conformational changes upon chemical unfolding by a combination of electron paramagnetic resonance and NMR spectroscopies, revealing that the conformational transitions involve mostly the cytoplasmic regions, with two concomitant phenomena: (1) membrane binding and folding of the amphipathic domain Ia and (2) folding/unfolding of the juxtamembrane domain Ib of PLN. Analysis of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated PLN with two phosphomimetic mutants of PLN (S16E and S16D) shows that the population of an unfolded state in domains Ia and Ib (T′ state) is linearly correlated to the extent of SERCA inhibition measured by activity assays. Inhibition of SERCA is carried out by the folded ground state (T state) of the protein (PLN), while the relief of inhibition involves promotion of PLN to excited conformational states (Ser16 phosphorylated PLN). We propose that PLN population shifts (folding/unfolding) are a key regulatory mechanism for SERCA.",phospholamban;excited states;NMR;Ca-ATPase;membrane proteins

The sensing, killing, and lysing devices were characterized to elucidate their detection, antimicrobial and pyocin release functionalities, which subsequently aided in the construction of the final system and the verification of its designed behavior. We demonstrated that our engineered E. coli sensed and killed planktonic P. aeruginosa, evidenced by 99% reduction in the viable cells. Moreover, we showed that our engineered E. coli inhibited the formation of P. aeruginosa biofilm by close to 90%, leading to much sparser and thinner biofilm matrices.

Ten isogenic pairs of clinical MRSA DAP-susceptible/DAP-resistant (DAPs/DAPr) strains were tested against two distinct HDPs differing in structure, mechanism of action, and origin (thrombin-induced platelet microbicidal proteins [tPMPs] and human neutrophil peptide-1 [hNP-1]) and one bacterium-derived CAP, polymyxin B (PMB). Seven of 10 DAPr strains had point mutations in the mprF locus (with or without yyc operon mutations), while three DAPr strains had neither mutation. Several phenotypic parameters previously associated with DAPr were also examined: cell membrane order (fluidity), surface charge, and cell wall thickness profiles. Compared to the 10 DAPs parental strains, their respective DAPr strains exhibited (i) significantly reduced susceptibility to killing by all three peptides (P < 0.05), (ii) increased cell membrane fluidity, and (iii) significantly thicker cell walls (P < 0.0001). There was no consistent pattern of surface charge profiles distinguishing DAPs and DAPr strain pairs. Reduced in vitro susceptibility to two HDPs and one bacterium-derived CAP tracked closely with DAPr in these 10 recent MRSA clinical isolates. These results suggest that adaptive mechanisms involved in the evolution of DAPr also provide MRSA with enhanced survivability against HDPs. Such adaptations appear to correlate with MRSA variations in cell membrane order and cell wall structure. DAPr strains with or without mutations in the mprF locus demonstrated significant cross-resistance profiles to these unrelated CAPs.",

A promising biotechnology tool emerged when a structure-based substitution at Asp-207 was shown to be an infrared fluorophore that uses a biologically available tetrapyrrole chromophore. We report multiple crystal structures of this D207H variant of the Deinococcus radiodurans CBD, in which His-207 is observed to form a hydrogen bond with either the tetrapyrrole A-ring oxygen or the Tyr-263 hydroxyl. Based on the implications of this duality for fluorescence properties, Y263F was introduced and shown to have stronger fluorescence than the original D207H template. Our structures are consistent with the model that the Y263F change prevents a red light-induced far-red light absorbing phytochrome chromophore configuration. With the goal of decreasing size and thereby facilitating use as a fluorescent tag in vivo, we also engineered a monomeric form of the CBD. Unexpectedly, photoconversion was observed in the monomer despite the lack of a PHY domain. This observation underscores an interplay between dimerization and the photochemical properties of phytochrome and suggests that the monomeric CBD could be used for further studies of the photocycle. The D207H substitution on its own in the monomer did not result in fluorescence, whereas Y263F did. Combined, the D207H and Y263F substitutions in the monomeric CBD lead to the brightest of our variants, designated Wisconsin infrared phytofluor (Wi-Phy).",Fluorescence;Photoreceptors;Protein Engineering;Protein Structure;X-ray Crystallography;IFP1.4;Wi-Phy;Biliverdin;Chromophore-binding Domain;Phytochrome

There is major interest in the therapeutic intervention on such aberrant aggregation phenomena, and the utilization of polyaromatic scaffolds has lately received considerable attention. In this regard, the molecular and structural basis of the anti-amyloidogenicity of polyaromatic compounds, required to evolve this molecular scaffold toward therapeutic drugs, is not known in detail. We present here biophysical and biochemical studies that have enabled us to characterize the interaction of metal-substituted, tetrasulfonated phthalocyanines (PcTS) with α-synuclein (AS), the major protein component of amyloid-like deposits in Parkinson disease. The inhibitory activity of the assayed compounds on AS amyloid fibril formation decreases in the order PcTS[Ni(II)] ∼ PcTS > PcTS[Zn(II)] ≫ PcTS[Al(III)] ≈ 0. Using NMR and electronic absorption spectroscopies we demonstrated conclusively that the differences in binding capacity and anti-amyloid activity of phthalocyanines on AS are attributed to their relative ability to self-stack through π-π interactions, modulated by the nature of the metal ion bound at the molecule. Low order stacked aggregates of phthalocyanines were identified as the active amyloid inhibitory species, whose effects are mediated by residue specific interactions. Such sequence-specific anti-amyloid behavior of self-stacked phthalocyanines contrasts strongly with promiscuous amyloid inhibitors with self-association capabilities that act via nonspecific sequestration of AS molecules. The new findings reported here constitute an important contribution for future drug discovery efforts targeting amyloid formation.",Amyloid;Biophysics;NMR;Parkinson Disease;Synuclein

An important relation from which hydrodynamic radii of the aggregate is routinely measured is the classic Stokes-Einstein equation.

They signal by assembling a receptor heterotetramer composed of two TβRI:TβRII heterodimers. To investigate whether the two heterodimers bind and signal autonomously, one of the TGF-β protomers was substituted to block receptor binding. The substituted dimer, TGF-β3 WD, bound the TβRII extracellular domain and recruited the TβRI with affinities indistinguishable from TGF-β3, but with one-half the stoichiometry. TGF-β3 WD was further shown to retain one-quarter to one-half the signalling activity of TGF-β3 in three established assays for TGF-β function. Single-molecule fluorescence imaging with GFP-tagged receptors demonstrated a measurable increase in the proportion of TβRI and TβRII dimers upon treatment with TGF-β3, but not with TGF-β3 WD. These results provide evidence that the two TβRI:TβRII heterodimers bind and signal in an autonomous manner.

In PD, mutations in alpha-synuclein (αsyn) or multiplication of the SNCA gene encoding αsyn, result in a phenotype of cellular inclusions, cell death, and brain dysfunction. While the historical point of view has been that the macroscopic aggregates containing αsyn are the toxic species, in the last several years evidence has emerged that suggests instead that smaller soluble species - likely oligomers containing misfolded αsyn - are actually the toxic moiety and that the fibrillar inclusions may even be a cellular detoxification pathway and less harmful. If soluble misfolded species of αsyn are the toxic moieties, then cellular mechanisms that degrade misfolded αsyn would be neuroprotective and a rational target for drug development. In this review we will discuss the fundamental mechanisms underlying αsyn toxicity including oligomer formation, oxidative stress, and degradation pathways and consider rational therapeutic strategies that may have the potential to prevent or halt αsyn induced pathogenesis in PD.",Alpha-synuclein;Parkinson’s disease;chaperones;oligomers;heat shock proteins;oxidative stress;degradation;neurodegeneration

Epigenomic and genomic lesions in pathways regulating B-cell activation, cell cycle progression, protein homeostasis, DNA damage response, cell proliferation and apoptosis contribute to its pathogenesis. While patients typically respond to first-line chemotherapy, relapse is the rule resulting in a median survival of 5–7 years. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR appears as a key pathway in the pathogenesis and can be targeted with small molecules. Most experience is with mTOR inhibitors of the rapamycin class. Second-generation mTOR inhibitors and the PI3K inhibitor CAL-101 are novel options to more effectively target this pathway. Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibition by PCI-32765 has promising activity and indicates immunoreceptor signaling as a novel therapeutic target. Up to 50% of relapsed patients respond to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib suggesting that MCL may be particularly sensitive to disruption of protein homeostasis and/or induction of oxidative stress. Recent work has focused on elucidating the mechanism of bortezomib-induced cytotoxicity and the development of second-generation proteasome inhibitors. DNA hypomethylating agents and histone deacetylase inhibitors effect epigenetic de-repression of aberrantly silenced genes. These epigenetic pharmaceuticals and HSP90 inhibitors can synergize with proteasome inhibitors. Finally, BH3 mimetics are emerging as tools to sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy. Participation in clinical trials offers patients a chance to benefit from these advances and is essential to maintain the momentum of progress. Innovative trial designs may be needed to expedite the clinical development of these targeted agents.",

Since genotype 1 viruses account for most HCV disease yet differ substantially in sequence from that of JFH-1, we studied the role of NS5A in the production of the H77S virus. While less efficient than JFH-1, genotype 1a H77S RNA produces infectious virus when transfected into permissive Huh-7 cells. The exchange of complete NS5A sequences between these viruses was highly detrimental to replication, while exchanges of the C-terminal domain III sequence (46% amino acid sequence identity) were well tolerated, with little effect on RNA synthesis. Surprisingly, the placement of the H77S domain III sequence into JFH-1 resulted in increased virus yields; conversely, H77S yields were reduced by the introduction of domain III from JFH-1. These changes in infectious virus yield correlated well with changes in the abundance of NS5A in RNA-transfected cells but not with RNA replication or core protein expression levels. Alanine replacement mutagenesis of selected Ser and Thr residues in the C-terminal domain III sequence revealed no single residue to be essential for infectious H77S virus production. However, virus production was eliminated by Ala substitutions at multiple residues and could be restored by phosphomimetic Asp substitutions at these sites. Thus, despite low overall sequence homology, the production of infectious virus is regulated similarly in JFH-1 and H77S viruses by a conserved function associated with a C-terminal Ser/Thr cluster in domain III of NS5A.",

The subcellular localization of activated mDia2 depends on interactions with actin filaments and the plasma membrane. We investigated the poorly understood mechanism of plasma membrane targeting of mDia2 and found that the entire N-terminal region of mDia2 preceding the actin-polymerizing formin homology domains 1 and 2 (FH1–FH2) module was potently targeted to the membrane. This localization was enhanced by Rif, but not by other tested small GTPases, and depended on a positively charged N-terminal basic domain (BD). The BD bound acidic phospholipids in vitro, suggesting that in vivo it may associate with the plasma membrane through electrostatic interactions. Unexpectedly, a fragment consisting of the GTPase-binding region and the diaphanous inhibitory domain (G-DID), thought to mediate the interaction with GTPases, was not targeted to the plasma membrane even in the presence of constitutively active Rif. Addition of the BD or dimerization/coiled coil domains to G-DID rescued plasma membrane targeting in cells. Direct binding of Rif to mDia2 N terminus required the presence of both G and DID. These results suggest that the entire N terminus of mDia2 serves as a coincidence detection module, directing mDia2 to the plasma membrane through interactions with phospholipids and activated Rif.",

These six CusB molecules form a channel extending contiguously from the top of the pump. The affinity of the CusA and CusB interaction was found to be in the micromolar range. Finally, we predicted a three-dimensional structure of the trimeric CusC outer membrane channel, and develop a model of the tripartite efflux assemblage.

We investigated the impact of the yeast activator Blm10 on proteasomal peptide and protein degradation. We found enhanced degradation of peptide substrates in the presence of Blm10 and demonstrated that Blm10 has the capacity to accelerate proteasomal turnover of the unstructured protein tau-441 in vitro. Mechanistically, proteasome activation requires the opening of a closed gate, which allows passage of unfolded proteins into the catalytic chamber. Our data indicate that gate opening by Blm10 is achieved via engagement of its C-terminal segment with the CP. Crucial for this activity is a conserved C-terminal YYX motif, with the penultimate tyrosine playing a preeminent role. Thus, Blm10 utilizes a gate opening strategy analogous to the proteasomal ATPases HbYX-dependent mechanism. Because gating incompetent Blm10 C-terminal point mutants confers a loss of function phenotype, we propose that the cellular function of Blm10 is based on CP association and activation to promote the degradation of proteasome substrates.",Enzyme Kinetics;Proteasome;Protein Degradation;Protein-Protein Interactions;Structural Biology

In this research, we studied the roles of these four acidic residues in PARN thermal stability by mutational analysis. It was found that Mg2+ significantly decreased the rate but increased the aggregate size of the 54 kDa wild-type PARN in a concentration-dependent manner. All of the four mutants decreased PARN thermal aggregation, while the aggregation kinetics of the mutants exhibited dissimilar Mg2+-dependent behavior. A comparison of the kinetic parameters indicated that Asp28 was the most crucial one to the binding of the two Mg2+ ions, while metal B might be more important in PARN structural stability. The spectroscopic and aggregation results also suggested that the alterations in the active site structure by metal binding or mutations might lead to a global conformational change of the PARN molecule.",aggregation kinetics;magnesium ions;poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN);structural stability;thermal aggregation;two-metal-ion catalysis

Attempts to use reverse vaccinology to generate an HIV-1 vaccine on the basis of the structure of viral epitopes bound to monoclonal neutralizing antibodies have failed so far because it was not possible to extrapolate from an observed antigenic structure to the immunogenic structure required in a vaccine. Vaccine immunogenicity depends on numerous extrinsic factors such as the host immunoglobulin gene repertoire, the presence of various cellular and regulatory mechanisms in the immunized host and the process of antibody affinity maturation. All these factors played a role in the appearance of the neutralizing antibody used to select the epitope to be investigated as potential vaccine immunogen, but they cannot be expected to be present in identical form in the host to be vaccinated. It is possible to rationally design and optimize an epitope to fit one particular antibody molecule or to improve the paratope binding efficacy of a monoclonal antibody intended for passive immunotherapy. What is not possible is to rationally design an HIV-1 vaccine immunogen that will elicit a protective polyclonal antibody response of predetermined efficacy. An effective vaccine immunogen can only be discovered by investigating experimentally the immunogenicity of a candidate molecule and demonstrating its ability to induce a protective immune response. It cannot be discovered by determining which epitopes of an engineered antigen molecule are recognized by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody. This means that empirical immunogenicity trials rather than structural analyses of antigens offer the best hope of discovering an HIV-1 vaccine.",Vaccine Immunogen;Reverse Vaccinology;Discontinuous Epitope;Antipeptide Antibody;Membrane Proximate External Region

Several observations suggested that the usual allosteric mechanism might not apply to the activation of IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH) by monovalent cations. Therefore we investigated the mechanism of K+ activation in IMPDH by delineating the kinetic mechanism in the absence of monovalent cations. Surprisingly, the K+-dependence of kcat derives from the rate of flap closure, which increases by ≥65-fold in the presence of K+. We performed both alchemical free energy simulations and potential of mean force calculations using the orthogonal space random walk strategy to computationally analyze how K+ accelerates this conformational change. The simulations recapitulate the preference of IMPDH for K+, validating the computational models. When K+ is replaced with a dummy ion, the residues of the K+ binding site relax into ordered secondary structure, creating a barrier to conformational exchange. K+ mobilizes these residues by providing alternate interactions for the main chain carbonyls. Potential of mean force calculations indicate that K+ changes the shape of the energy well, shrinking the reaction coordinate by shifting the closed conformation toward the open state. This work suggests that allosteric regulation can be under kinetic as well as thermodynamic control.",

Zimniak)","This review begins with the premise that an organism's life span is determined by the balance between two countervailing forces: (i) the sum of destabilizing effects, and (ii) the sum of protective longevity-assurance processes. Against this backdrop, the role of electrophiles is discussed, both as destabilizing factors and as signals that induce protective responses. Because most biological macromolecules contain nucleophilic centers, electrophiles are particularly reactive and toxic in a biological context. The majority of cellular electrophiles are generated from polyunsaturated fatty acids by a peroxidation chain reaction that is readily triggered by oxygen-centered radicals, but propagates without further input of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, the formation of lipid-derived electrophiles such as 4-hydroxynon-2-enal (4-HNE) is proposed to be relatively insensitive to the level of initiating ROS, but to depend mainly on the availability of peroxidation-susceptible fatty acids. This is consistent with numerous observations that life span is inversely correlated to membrane peroxidizability, and with the hypothesis that 4-HNE may constitute the mechanistic link between high susceptibility of membrane lipids to peroxidation and shortened life span. Experimental interventions that directly alter membrane composition (and thus their peroxidizability) or modulate 4-HNE levels have the expected effects on life span, establishing that the connection is not only correlative but causal. Specific molecular mechanisms are considered, by which 4-HNE could (i) destabilize biological systems via non-targeted reactions with cellular macromolecules, and (ii) modulate signaling pathways that control longevity assurance mechanisms.",aging;longevity assurance;reactive oxygen species;lipid peroxidation;membrane peroxidizability;polyunsaturated fatty acids;oxidative damage;electrophilic damage;electrophiles;4-HNE;4-hydroxynonenal;4-hydroxynon-2-enal;aldehydes

Separation of mildly disrupted A431 cell membranes on sucrose density gradients revealed cofractionation of CDS and PI synthase activities with cholesterol-poor, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and partial overlap with plasma membrane caveolae. Cofractionation of CDS activity with caveolae was also observed when low-buoyant density caveolin-enriched membranes were prepared using a carbonate-based method. However, immunoisolation studies determined that CDS activity localized to ER membrane fragments containing calnexin and type III inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate receptors but not to caveolae. Membrane fragmentation in neutral pH buffer established that CDP-diacylglycerol and PI syntheses were restricted to a subfraction of the calnexin-positive ER. In contrast to lipid rafts enriched for caveolin, cholesterol, and GM1 glycosphingolipids, the CDS-containing ER membranes were detergent soluble. In cell imaging studies, CDS and calnexin colocalized in microdomain-sized patches of the ER and also unexpectedly at the plasma membrane.

Chromatin is a repressive barrier that plays an important role in protecting genomic DNA and regulating access to it. This barrier must be temporarily removed during transcription, replication, and repair, but it also must be rapidly restored to the original state afterwards. Further, the properties of chromatin are dynamic and must be adjusted as conditions dictate. FACT was identified as a factor that destabilizes nucleosomes in vitro, but it has now also been implicated as a central factor in the deposition of histones to form nucleosomes, as an exchange factor that swaps the histones within existing nucleosomes for variant forms, and as a tether that prevents histones from being displaced by the passage of RNA polymerases during transcription. FACT therefore plays central roles in building, maintaining, adjusting, and overcoming the chromatin barrier. This review summarizes recent results that have begun to reveal how FACT can promote what appear to be contradictory goals, using a simple set of binding activities to both enhance and diminish the stability of nucleosomes.",

After secretion, the pro-proteases fold to their active conformations in a process that includes the autolytic removal of the pro-peptide. We review the life cycle of the thermolysin-like protease from Bacillus stearothermophilus in light of the calcium dependent stability and instability of the N-terminal domain. The protease binds calcium ions in the regions that are involved in the autolytic maturation process. It is generally assumed that the calcium ions contribute to the extreme stability of the protease, but experimental evidence for TLP-ste indicates that at least one of the calcium ions plays a regulatory role.

Here we demonstrate that the distinctive parH site (∼100-bp) consists of an array of degenerate tetramer boxes interspersed by AT-rich spacers. Although numerous consecutive AT-steps are suggestive of inherent curvature, parH lacks an intrinsic bend. Sequential deletion of parH tetramers progressively reduced centromere function. Nevertheless, the variant subsites could be rearranged in different geometries that accommodated centromere activity effectively revealing that the site is highly elastic in vivo. ParG cooperatively coated parH: proper centromere binding necessitated the protein's N-terminal flexible tails which modulate the centromere binding affinity of ParG. Interaction of the ParG ribbon–helix–helix domain with major groove bases in the tetramer boxes likely provides direct readout of the centromere. In contrast, the AT-rich spacers may be implicated in indirect readout that mediates cooperativity between ParG dimers assembled on adjacent boxes. ParF alone does not bind parH but instead loads into the segrosome interactively with ParG, thereby subtly altering centromere conformation. Assembly of ParF into the complex requires the N-terminal flexible tails in ParG that are contacted by ParF.",

Despite their diverse functions, all remodellers share highly conserved ATPase domains, many shown to translocate DNA. Understanding remodelling requires biophysical knowledge of the DNA translocation process: how the ATPase moves DNA and generates force, and how translocation and force generation are coupled on nucleosomes. Here, we characterize the real-time activity of a minimal RSC translocase ‘motor' on bare DNA, using high-resolution optical tweezers and a ‘tethered' translocase system. We observe on dsDNA a processivity of ∼35 bp, a speed of ∼25 bp/s, and a step size of 2.0 (±0.4, s.e.m.) bp. Surprisingly, the motor is capable of moving against high force, up to 30 pN, making it one of the most force-resistant motors known. We also provide evidence for DNA ‘buckling' at initiation. These observations reveal the ATPase as a powerful DNA translocating motor capable of disrupting DNA–histone interactions by mechanical force.",ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complex;DNA translocase;optical tweezers;step size

This strategy was applied to study the interaction between aminoglycoside N-(6′)-acetyltransferase-Ii and one of its substrates, acetyl coenzyme A. It was found that homotropic allostery between the two active sites of the homo-dimeric enzyme is modulated by opposing mechanisms.

Much less is known regarding interactions that might involve the tapasin C-terminal Ig-like domain. Additionally, the tapasin transmembrane/cytoplasmic region enables tapasin to bridge the MHC class I molecule to the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). In this investigation, we made use of two tapasin mutants to determine the relative contribution of the tapasin C-terminal Ig-like domain and the tapasin transmembrane/cytoplasmic region to the assembly of MHC class I molecules. Deletion of a loop within the tapasin C-terminal Ig-like domain (Δ334-342) prevented tapasin association with the MHC class I molecule Kd. Although tapasin Δ334-342 did not increase the efficiency of Kd folding, Kd surface expression was enhanced on cells expressing this mutant relative to tapasin-deficient cells. In contrast to tapasin Δ334-342, a soluble tapasin mutant lacking the transmembrane/cytoplasmic region retained the ability to bind to Kd molecules, but did not facilitate Kd surface expression. Furthermore, when soluble tapasin and tapasin Δ334-342 were co-expressed, soluble tapasin had a dominant negative effect on the folding and surface expression of not only Kd, but also Db and Kb. In addition, our molecular modeling of the MHC class I-tapasin interface revealed novel potential interactions involving tapasin residues 334-342. Together, these findings demonstrate that the tapasin C-terminal and transmembrane/cytoplasmic regions are critical to tapasin's capacity to associate effectively with the MHC class I molecule.",antigen processing and presentation;Kd;MHC class I;peptide-loading complex;tapasin;transporter associated with antigen processing

These recruitment sites bind modular-docking sequences called docking sites and are potentially attractive sites for the development of non-ATP competitive inhibitors. The D-recruitment site (DRS) and the F-recruitment site (FRS) bind D-sites and F-sites, respectively. For example, peptides that target the FRS have been proposed to inhibit all ERK2 activity (J. Biol. Chem. 2001, 276, 965-973), however it has not been established whether this inhibition is steric or allosteric in origin. To facilitate inhibitor design and to examine potential coupling of recruitment sites to other ligand recognition sites within ERK2 Energetic coupling within ERK2 was investigated using two new modular peptide substrates for ERK2. Modeling shows that one peptide (Sub-D) recognizes the DRS, while the other peptide (Sub-F) binds the FRS. A steady-state kinetic analysis reveals little evidence of thermodynamic linkage between peptide substrate and ATP. Both peptides are phosphorylated through a random-order sequential mechanism with a kcat/Km comparable to Ets-1, a bona fide ERK2 substrate. Occupancy of the FRS with a peptide containing a modular docking sequence has no effect on the intrinsic ability of ERK2 to phosphorylate Sub-D. Occupancy of the DRS with a peptide containing a modular docking sequence has a slight effect (1.3 ± 0.1-fold increase in kcat) on the intrinsic ability of ERK2 to phosphorylate Sub-F. These data suggest that while docking interactions at the DRS and the FRS are energetically uncoupled, the DRS can exhibit weak communication to the active site. In addition, they suggest that peptides bound to the FRS inhibit the phosphorylation of protein substrates through a steric mechanism. The modeling and kinetic data suggest that the recruitment of ERK2 to cellular locations via its DRS may facilitate the formation of F-site selective ERK2 signaling complexes, while recruitment via the FRS will likely inhibit ERK2 through a steric mechanism of inhibition. Such recruitment may serve as an additional level of ERK2 regulation.",

In the nucleus, La binds primarily to 3′ oligoU containing RNAs, while in the cytoplasm La interacts with an array of different mRNAs lacking a 3′ UUUOH trailer. An example of the latter is the binding of La to the IRES domain IV of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA, which is associated with viral translation stimulation. By systematic biophysical investigations, we have found that La binds to domain IV using an RNA recognition that is quite distinct from its mode of binding to RNAs with a 3′ UUUOH trailer: although the La motif and first RNA recognition motif (RRM1) are sufficient for high-affinity binding to 3′ oligoU, recognition of HCV domain IV requires the La motif and RRM1 to work in concert with the atypical RRM2 which has not previously been shown to have a significant role in RNA binding. This new mode of binding does not appear sequence specific, but recognizes structural features of the RNA, in particular a double-stranded stem flanked by single-stranded extensions. These findings pave the way for a better understanding of the role of La in viral translation initiation.",

The protein kinase SRPK1 phosphorylates approximately 10 serines in the arginine-serine-rich domain (RS domain) of the SR protein SRSF1 in a C-to-N-terminal direction, a modification that directs this essential splicing factor from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Transient-state kinetic experiments illustrate that the first phosphate is added rapidly onto the RS domain of SRSF1 (t1/2 = 0.1 sec) followed by slower, multi-site phosphorylation at the remaining serines (t1/2 = 15 sec). Mutagenesis experiments suggest that efficient phosphorylation rates are maintained by an extensive hydrogen bonding and electrostatic network between the RS domain of the SR protein and the active site and docking groove of the kinase. Catalytic trapping and viscosometric experiments demonstrate that while the phosphoryl transfer step is fast, ADP release limits multi-site phosphorylation. By studying phosphate incorporation into selectively pre-phosphorylated forms of the enzyme-substrate complex, the kinetic mechanism for site-specific phosphorylation along the reaction coordinate was assessed. The binding affinity of the SR protein, the phosphoryl transfer rate and ADP exchange rate were found to decline significantly as a function of progressive phosphorylation in the RS domain. These findings indicate that the protein substrate actively modulates initiation, extension and termination events associated with prolonged, multi-site phosphorylation.",

Binding of cGMP to Pαβγ is suppressed during its formation, implying that cGMP binding is not involved in Pαβγγ activation. Once bound to Pαβγ [3H]cGMP is not dissociated even in the presence of a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled cGMP, binding of cGMP changes the apparent Stokes radius of Pαβγ, and the amount of [3H]cGMP-bound Pαβγ trapped by a filter is spontaneously increased during its incubation. These results suggest that Pαβγ slowly changes its conformation after cGMP binding, i.e., after formation of Pαβγ containing two cGMPs. Binding of Pγ greatly shortens the time to detect the increase in the filter-trapped level of [3H]cGMP-bound Pαβγ, but alters neither the level nor its Stokes radius. These results suggest that Pγ accelerates the conformational change, but does not add another change. These observations are consistent with the view that Pαβγ changes its conformation during its deactivation and that the binding of cGMP and Pγ is crucial for this change. These observations also imply that Pαβγγ changes its conformation during its activation and that release of Pγ and cGMP is essential for this change.",PDE;PDE6;cGMP binding;GAF domains;transducin;retinal phototransduction;G protein-mediated signal transduction;cGMP-binding-dependent protein conformational change

We have solved the crystal structure of the FOXP3 forkhead domain, as a ternary complex with the DNA-binding domain of nuclear factor of activated T cells-1 (NFAT1) and a DNA oligonucleotide from the interleukin-2 promoter. A striking feature of this structure is that FOXP3 forms a domain-swapped dimer that bridges two molecules of DNA. Structure-guided or autoimmune disease (IPEX)-associated mutations in the domain-swap interface diminished dimer formation by the FOXP3 forkhead domain without compromising FOXP3 DNA binding. These mutations also eliminated T cell suppressive activity conferred by FOXP3, both in vitro and in a murine model of autoimmune diabetes in vivo. We conclude that FOXP3-mediated suppressor function requires dimerization through the forkhead domain, and that mutations in the dimer interface can lead to the systemic autoimmunity observed in IPEX patients.",

To evaluate such conformational changes and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of subsequent protein function, experimental identification of conformational substates and characterization of conformational equilibria are mandatory. We apply pressure modulation in combination with FTIR spectroscopy to reveal equilibria between spectroscopically resolved substates of the lipidated signaling protein N-Ras. Pressure has the advantage that its thermodynamic conjugate is volume, a parameter that is directly related to structure. The conformational dynamics of N-Ras in its different nucleotide binding states in the absence and presence of a model biomembrane was probed by pressure perturbation. We show that not only nucleotide binding but also the presence of the membrane has a drastic effect on the conformational dynamics and selection of conformational substates of the protein, and a new substate appearing upon membrane binding could be uncovered. Population of this new substate is accompanied by structural reorientations of the G domain, as also indicated by complementary ATR-FTIR and IRRAS measurements. These findings thus illustrate that the membrane controls signaling conformations by acting as an effective interaction partner, which has consequences for the G-domain orientation of membrane-associated N-Ras, which in turn is known to be critical for its effector and modulator interactions. Finally, these results provide insights into the influence of pressure on Ras-controlled signaling events in organisms living under extreme environmental conditions as they are encountered in the deep sea where pressures reach the kbar range.",high pressure;protein–membrane interactions;Ras protein signaling

These signaling responses of course include the classical mobilization of Ca2+ and activation of protein kinase C that are cornerstones of PLC-dependent signaling, but the activities of a broad range of membrane, cytoskeletal, and cytosolic proteins also are directly regulated by PLC-mediated changes in membrane concentrations of PtdIns(4,5)P2. Thus, signaling responses exhibiting many different characteristics radiate from PLC-β isozymes. The forms that these signaling nodes take both spatially and functionally remain poorly understood, but application of increasingly sophisticated live cell-imaging capabilities offers great promise for new understanding. Strong insight into the physiological functions that depend on Gq/PLC-β signaling complexes is available, but much is yet to be learned about their roles in human physiology and pathophysiology. Understanding of these nodes at the mechanistic level has increased recently with the availability of three-dimensional structures of G protein-bound PLC-β isozymes. This information should in turn provide both reagents and new research directions that increase insight into inositol lipid signaling at the cellular and intact animal levels. The absence of pharmacological agents that selectively target PLC isozymes has definitely slowed research progress, and an out-standing contribution would be made by discovery of such molecules. PLC-β-selective inhibitors may also have clinical value. For example, a large preponderance of uveal melanomas have somatic mutations in Gαq or Gα11 that result in constitutive activation of these signaling proteins and their downstream signaling responses.120,121",

Second, membrane systems should be metastable at large length scales, ensuring the correct function of the particular organelle and its turnover during cellular division. Lipids, through their ability to exist with many shapes (polymorphism), provide an adequate construction material for cellular membranes. They can self-assemble into shells that are very flexible, albeit hardly stretchable, which allows for their far-reaching morphological and topological behaviors.

Expansion of the glutamine region facilitates aggregation of the impacted protein, and aggregation has been linked to neurotoxicity. Studies of synthetic peptides have contributed substantially to our understanding of the mechanism of aggregation, because the underlying biophysics of polyglutamine-mediated association can be probed independent of their context within a larger protein. In this report, interrupting residues were inserted into polyglutamine peptides (Q20), and the impact on conformational and aggregation properties was examined. A peptide with 2 alanine residues formed laterally-aligned fibrillar aggregates which were similar to the uninterrupted Q20 peptide. Insertion of 2 proline residues resulted in soluble, nonfibrillar aggregates, which did not mature into insoluble aggregates. In contrast, insertion of a β-turn template DPG rapidly accelerated aggregation and resulted in a fibrillar aggregate morphology with little lateral alignment between fibrils. These results are interpreted to indicate that (a) long-range nonspecific interactions lead to the formation of soluble oligomers, while maturation of oligomers into fibrils requires conformational conversion, and (b) that soluble oligomers dynamically interact with each other, while insoluble aggregates are relatively inert. Kinetic analysis revealed that the increase in aggregation caused by the DPG insert is inconsistent with the nucleation-elongation mechanism of aggregation featuring a monomeric β-sheet nucleus. Rather, the data support a mechanism of polyglutamine aggregation by which monomers associate into soluble oligomers, which then undergo slow structural rearrangement to form sedimentable aggregates.",kinetic analysis;oligomers;peptide collapse;polyglutamine;nucleation-elongation

These inhibitors have been of great importance to the biochemical characterization of PPP-family protein phosphatases since their discovery, but also maintain in natura biological significance with their endogenous regulatory properties (protein inhibitors) and toxicity (small molecule inhibitors). Recently, two unique PPP-family protein phosphatases, named the Shewanella-like protein phosphatases (SLP phosphatases), from Arabidopsis thaliana were characterized and found to be phylogenetically similar to the PPP-family protein phosphatases protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), while completely lacking sensitivity to the classic PPP-family phosphatase small molecule inhibitors okadaic acid and microcystin-LR. SLP phosphatases were also found to be absent in metazoans, but present in a wide range of bacteria, fungi and protozoa responsible for human disease.

","Using the single-protein-production (SPP) system, a protein of interest can be exclusively produced in high yield from its ACA-less gene in Escherichia coli expressing MazF, an ACA-specific mRNA interferase. It is thus feasible to study a membrane protein by solid-state NMR (SSNMR) directly in natural membrane fractions. In developing isotope-enrichment methods, we observed that 13C was also incorporated into phospholipids, generating spurious signals in SSNMR spectra. Notable, with the SPP system a protein can be produced in total absence of cell growth caused by antibiotics.

Glutathione synthetase from the Antarctic eubacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis (PhGshB) has been expressed, purified and successfully crystallized. An overall improvement of the crystal quality has been obtained by adapting the crystal growth conditions found with vapor diffusion experiments to the without-oil microbatch method.

Importantly, we found that the kinetics of conformational exchange and the extent of ground and excited states in detergent micelles and lipid bilayers are different, revealing a possible regulatory role of the membrane composition on the allosteric regulation of SERCA.

The “central helix” of complexin is anchored to one SNARE complex while its “accessory helix” extends away at ~45° and bridges to a second complex, occupying the vacant v-SNARE binding site to inhibit fusion. That the accessory helix competes with the v-SNARE for t-SNARE binding was expected, but surprisingly, the interaction occurs inter-molecularly.

However, because of their transient and highly polymorphic properties, the details of their self-association remain elusive. Here we explore oligomer structure using a model system—macrocyclic peptides. Key amyloidogenic sequences from Aβ and tau were incorporated into macrocycles, thereby restraining them to β-strands, but limiting the growth of the oligomers so they may crystallize and cannot fibrillate. We determined the atomic structures for four such oligomers, and all four reveal tetrameric interfaces in which β-sheet dimers pair together by highly complementary, dry interfaces, analogous to steric zippers found in fibers, suggesting a common structure for amyloid oligomers and fibers. In amyloid fibers, the axes of the paired sheets are either parallel or antiparallel, whereas the oligomeric interfaces display a variety of sheet-to-sheet pairing angles, offering a structural explanation for the heterogeneity of amyloid oligomers.",

","Cells that comprise tissues often need to coordinate cytoskeletal events to execute morphogenesis properly. For epithelial tissues, some of that coordination is accomplished by polarization of the cells within the plane of the epithelium. Two groups of genes – the Dachsous (Ds) and Frizzled (Fz) systems – play key roles in the establishment and maintenance of such polarity. There has been great progress in uncovering the how these genes work together to produce planar polarity, yet fundamental questions remain unanswered. Here, we study the Drosophila larval ventral epidermis to begin to address several of these questions. We show that ds and fz contribute independently to polarity and that they do so over spatially distinct domains. Furthermore, we find that the requirement for the Ds system changes as field size increases. Lastly, we find that Ds and its putative receptor Fat (Ft) are enriched in distinct patterns in the epithelium during embryonic development.",Dachsous;Denticle;Drosophila;Fat;Frizzled;Planar cell polarity

However, ubiquitination-independent mechanisms of MDM2 have also been implicated. Here we show that MDM2 inhibits p53 DNA binding activity in vitro and in vivo. MDM2 binding promotes p53 to adopt a mutant-like conformation, losing reactivity to antibody Pab1620, while exposing the Pab240 epitope. The acidic domain of MDM2 is required to induce p53 conformational change and inhibit p53 DNA binding. Alternate reading frame binding to the MDM2 acidic domain restores p53 wild type conformation and rescues DNA binding activity. Furthermore, histone methyl transferase SUV39H1 binding to the MDM2 acidic domain also restores p53 wild type conformation and allows p53-MDM2-SUV39H1 complex to bind DNA. These results provide further evidence for an ubiquitination-independent mechanism of p53 regulation by MDM2 and reveal how MDM2-interacting repressors gain access to p53 target promoters and repress transcription. Furthermore, we show that the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin cooperates with the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib by stimulating p53 DNA binding and transcriptional activity, providing a rationale for combination therapy using proteasome and MDM2 inhibitors.",DNA-Protein Interaction;E3 Ubiquitin Ligase;p53;Proteasome;Protein Folding;ARF;Bortezomib;MDM2;MDMX;Conformation

Several host factors, including the human DEAD-box protein DDX1, are also known to be required for efficient Rev function. In this study, spontaneous assembly and dissociation of individual Rev-RRE complexes, in the presence or absence of DDX1, was observed in real-time via single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Binding of up to eight fluorescently-labeled Rev monomers to a single RRE molecule was visualized, and the event frequencies and corresponding binding and dissociation rates for the different Rev:RRE stoichiometries were determined. The presence of DDX1 eliminated a second kinetic phase present during the initial Rev binding step, attributed to non-productive nucleation events, resulting in increased occurrence of higher order Rev:RRE stoichiometries. This effect was further enhanced upon the addition of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog (AMP-PNP), whereas ADP had no effect beyond that of DDX1 alone. Notably, the first three Rev monomer binding events were accelerated in the presence of DDX1 and AMP-PNP, while the dissociation rates remained unchanged. Measurements performed across a range of DDX1 concentrations suggest that DDX1 targets Rev rather than the RRE to promote oligomeric assembly. Moreover, DDX1 is able to restore the oligomerization activity of a Rev mutant that is otherwise unable to assemble on the RRE beyond a monomeric complex. Taken together, these results suggest that DDX1 acts as a cellular cofactor by promoting oligomerization of Rev on the RRE.",viral RNA transport;cellular cofactors of HIV;ribonucleoprotein assembly;RNA-protein interactions;single-molecule fluorescence microscopy

To understand the underlying molecular mechanism, we have characterized the interactions of calmodulin with two peptides derived from human L-selectin. The peptide ARR18 corresponds to the entire cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin (residues Ala317–Tyr334 in the mature protein), and CLS corresponds to residues Lys280–Tyr334, which contains the entire transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of L-selectin. Monitoring the interaction by fluorescence spectroscopy and other biophysical techniques, we found that calmodulin can bind to ARR18 in aqueous solutions or the L-selectin cytoplasmic domain of CLS reconstituted in the phosphatidylcholine bilayer, both with an affinity of approximate 2 μM. The association is calcium-independent, dynamic and involves both lobes of calmodulin. In a phospholipid bilayer, the positively charged L-selectin cytoplasmic domain of CLS is associated with anionic phosphatidylserine lipids at the membrane interface through electrostatic interactions. Under conditions where the phosphatidylserine content mimics that in the inner leaflet of the cell plasma membrane, the interaction between calmodulin and CLS becomes undetectable. These results suggest that the association of calmodulin with L-selectin in the cell can be influenced by the membrane bilayer, and that anionic lipids may modulate ectodomain shedding of transmembrane receptors.",Ectodomain shedding;protein interaction;fluorescence spectroscopy;L-selectin;calmodulin

The biosynthesis of this compatible solute involves the activation of inositol to CDP-inositol via the action of a recently discovered CTP:inositol-1-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (IPCT) activity. In most cases, IPCT is part of a bifunctional enzyme comprising two domains: a cytoplasmic domain with IPCT activity and a membrane domain catalyzing the synthesis of di-myo-inositol-1,3′-phosphate-1′-phosphate from CDP-inositol and l-myo-inositol phosphate. Herein, we describe the first X-ray structure of the IPCT domain of the bifunctional enzyme from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus DSMZ 7324. The structure of the enzyme in the apo form was solved to a 1.9-Å resolution. The enzyme exhibited apparent Km values of 0.9 and 0.6 mM for inositol-1-phosphate and CTP, respectively. The optimal temperature for catalysis was in the range 90 to 95°C, and the Vmax determined at 90°C was 62.9 μmol · min−1 · mg of protein−1. The structure of IPCT is composed of a central seven-stranded mixed β-sheet, of which six β-strands are parallel, surrounded by six α-helices, a fold reminiscent of the dinucleotide-binding Rossmann fold. The enzyme shares structural homology with other pyrophosphorylases showing the canonical motif G-X-G-T-(R/S)-X4-P-K. CTP, l-myo-inositol-1-phosphate, and CDP-inositol were docked into the catalytic site, which provided insights into the binding mode and high specificity of the enzyme for CTP. This work is an important step toward the final goal of understanding the full catalytic route for DIP synthesis in the native, bifunctional enzyme.",

Transplantation of iPS cells showed higher expression levels of OC, Osx, and Runx2 genes, both 12 and 24 days postsurgery. At 24 days postsurgery in the iPS cell group, histological analysis showed much more new alveolar bone and cementum formation with regenerated periodontal ligament between them. The results showed the commitment role that EMD contributes in mesenchymal progenitors to early cells in the osteogenic lineage. iPS cells combined with EMD provide a valuable tool for periodontal tissue engineering, by promoting the formation of new cementum, alveolar bone, and normal periodontal ligament.",

Hence, when mimicking the process of amelogenesis in vitro, crystal growth has to be coupled to proteolytic digestion of the amelogenin assemblies that are known to play a pivotal role in conducting the proper crystal growth. Experimental settings based on controlled and programmable titration of amelogenin sols digested by means of MMP-20 with buffered calcium and phosphate solutions were employed to imitate the formation of elongated, plate-shaped crystals. While amelogenin can act as a promoter of nucleation and crystal growth alone, in this study we show that proteolysis exerts an additional nucleation- and growth-promoting effect. Hydrolysis of full-length amelogenin by MMP-20 decreases the critical time needed for the protein and peptides to adhere and to cover the substrate. The formation and immobilization of a protein layer subsequently reduces the time for calcium phosphate crystallization. Coupling the proteolytic reaction to titration in the presence of 0.4 mg/ml rH174 has been shown to have the same effect on the crystal growth promotion as quadrupling the concentration of rH174 to 1.6 mg/ml. Controlling the rate and the extent of the proteolytic cleavage can thus be used to control the nucleation and growth rates in a protein-guided crystallization system.",

We present the first high resolution crystal structure of the kinase domain of HER2 in complex with a selective inhibitor to understand protein activation, inhibition, and function at the molecular level. HER2 kinase domain crystallizes as a dimer and suggests evidence for an allosteric mechanism of activation comparable with previously reported activation mechanisms for EGFR and HER4. A unique Gly-rich region in HER2 following the α-helix C is responsible for increased conformational flexibility within the active site and could explain the low intrinsic catalytic activity previously reported for HER2. In addition, we solved the crystal structure of the kinase domain of EGFR in complex with a HER2/EGFR dual inhibitor (TAK-285). Comparison with previously reported inactive and active EGFR kinase domain structures gave insight into the mechanism of HER2 and EGFR inhibition and may help guide the design and development of new cancer drugs with improved potency and selectivity.",Cancer Therapy;Crystal Structure;Protein-Drug Interactions;Receptor Tyrosine Kinase;X-ray Crystallography;EGFR;ErbB Family;HER2;Allosteric Activation

Therefore, N gene has long been thought an ideal target for the design of small interference RNA (siRNA). siRNA is a class of small non-coding RNAs with a size of 21-25nt that functions post-transcriptionally to block targeted gene expression. In this study, we analyzed the N gene coding sequences derived from 16 different isolates, and found that nucleotide deletions and substitutions are mainly located at the first 440nt sequence. Combining previous reports and the above sequence information, we create three novel siRNAs that specifically target the conserved and unexploited regions in the N gene. We show that these siRNAs could effectively and specifically block the isolated N gene expression in mammal cells. Furthermore, we provide evidence to show that N gene can effectively up-regulate M gene mediated interferon β (IFNβ) production, while blocking N gene expression by specific siRNA significantly reduces IFNβ gene expression. Our data indicate that the inhibitory effect of siRNA on the isolated N gene expression might be influenced by the sequence context around the targeted sites.",siRNA;SARS-CoV;nucleocapsid gene;RT-PCR;EGFP

Studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicate that nucleosome occupancy is partially encoded by intrinsic antinucleosomal DNA sequences, such as poly(A) sequences, as well as by binding sites for trans-acting factors that can evict nucleosomes, such as Reb1 and the Rsc3/30 complex. Here, we use genome-wide nucleosome occupancy maps in 13 Ascomycota fungi to discover large-scale evolutionary reprogramming of both intrinsic and trans determinants of chromatin structure. We find that poly(G)s act as intrinsic antinucleosomal sequences, comparable to the known function of poly(A)s, but that the abundance of poly(G)s has diverged greatly between species, obscuring their antinucleosomal effect in low-poly(G) species such as S. cerevisiae. We also develop a computational method that uses nucleosome occupancy maps for discovering trans-acting general regulatory factor (GRF) binding sites. Our approach reveals that the specific sequences bound by GRFs have diverged substantially across evolution, corresponding to a number of major evolutionary transitions in the repertoire of GRFs. We experimentally validate a proposed evolutionary transition from Cbf1 as a major GRF in pre-whole-genome duplication (WGD) yeasts to Reb1 in post-WGD yeasts. We further show that the mating type switch-activating protein Sap1 is a GRF in S. pombe, demonstrating the general applicability of our approach. Our results reveal that the underlying mechanisms that determine in vivo chromatin organization have diverged and that comparative genomics can help discover new determinants of chromatin organization.",

A fluidlike rheological behavior was found for sphingomyelin. Lateral mobilities, measured from particle tracking experiments, were correlated with the monolayer viscosities through the usual hydrodynamic relationships. In conclusion, ceramide increases the solid character of sphingomyelin-based membranes and decreases their fluidity, thus drastically decreasing the lateral mobilities of embedded objects.

Structural comparison of Mm-cpn in ATP-free, ATP-bound, and ATP-hydrolysis states reveals that ATP binding alone causes the chaperonin to close slightly with a ~45° counterclockwise rotation of the apical domain. The subsequent ATP hydrolysis drives each subunit to rock toward the folding chamber and to close the lid completely. These motions are attributable to the local interactions of specific active site residues with the nucleotide, the tight couplings between the apical and intermediate domains within the subunit, and the aligned interactions between two subunits across the rings. This mechanism of structural changes in response to ATP is entirely different from those found in group I chaperonins.",

NMD also influences the expression of many physiological transcripts. SMG-1 is a large kinase essential to NMD that phosphorylates Upf1, which seems to be the definitive signal triggering mRNA decay. However, the regulation of the kinase activity of SMG-1 remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal the three-dimensional architecture of SMG-1 in complex with SMG-8 and SMG-9, and the structural mechanisms regulating SMG-1 kinase. A bent arm comprising a long region of HEAT (huntington, elongation factor 3, a subunit of PP2A and TOR1) repeats at the N terminus of SMG-1 functions as a scaffold for SMG-8 and SMG-9, and projects from the C-terminal core containing the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase domain. SMG-9 seems to control the activity of SMG-1 indirectly through the recruitment of SMG-8 to the N-terminal HEAT repeat region of SMG-1. Notably, SMG-8 binding to the SMG-1:SMG-9 complex specifically down-regulates the kinase activity of SMG-1 on Upf1 without contacting the catalytic domain. Assembly of the SMG-1:SMG-8:SMG-9 complex induces a significant motion of the HEAT repeats that is signaled to the kinase domain. Thus, large-scale conformational changes induced by SMG-8 after SMG-9-mediated recruitment tune SMG-1 kinase activity to modulate NMD.",nonsense-mediated mRNA decay;NMD;SMG-1;SMG-8;SMG-9;cryo-EM

While the mechanisms that regulate endocrine responsiveness and cell fate are not fully understood, interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF1) is strongly implicated as a key regulatory node in the underlying signaling network. IRF1 is a tumor suppressor that mediates cell fate by facilitating apoptosis and can do so with or without functional p53. Expression of IRF1 is downregulated in endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells, protecting these cells from IRF1-induced inhibition of proliferation and/or induction of cell death. Nonetheless, when IRF1 expression is induced following IFNγ treatment, antiestrogen sensitivity is restored by a process that includes the inhibition of prosurvival BCL2 family members and caspase activation. These data suggest that a combination of endocrine therapy and compounds that effectively induce IRF1 expression may be useful for the treatment of many ER+ breast cancers. By understanding IRF1 signaling in the context of endocrine responsiveness, we may be able to develop novel therapeutic strategies and better predict how patients will respond to endocrine therapy.",

These modified-natural surfactants are further compared to dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), a synthetic model surfactant of DPPC:palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) (7:3), and endogenous bovine natural surfactant. Atomic force microscopy reveals significant differences in the lateral structure and molecular organization of these surfactant preparations.

Constitutively active mutants are ubiquitously found among GPCRs and increase the inherent basal activity of the receptor, which often correlates with a pathological outcome. Here, we have used the M257Y6.40 constitutively active mutant of the photoreceptor rhodopsin in combination with the specific binding of a C-terminal fragment from the G protein alpha subunit (GαCT) to trap a light activated state for crystallization. The structure of the M257Y/GαCT complex contains the agonist all-trans-retinal covalently bound to the native binding pocket and resembles the G protein binding metarhodopsin-II conformation obtained by the natural activation mechanism; i.e., illumination of the prebound chromophore 11-cis-retinal. The structure further suggests a molecular basis for the constitutive activity of 6.40 substitutions and the strong effect of the introduced tyrosine based on specific interactions with Y2235.58 in helix 5, Y3067.53 of the NPxxY motif and R1353.50 of the E(D)RY motif, highly conserved residues of the G protein binding site.",constitutive activity;GPCRs;light-activated;rhodopsin

Interactions involving two of these sites, the D-recruitment site (DRS) and the F-recruitment site (FRS), have been shown to play a key role in signal transduction by ERK/MAP kinases. The dynamic nature of these recruitment events makes NMR uniquely suited to provide significant insight into these interactions. While NMR studies of kinases in general have been greatly hindered by their large size and complex dynamic behavior leading to the sub-optimal performance of standard methodologies, we have overcome these difficulties for inactive full-length ERK2 and obtained an acceptable level of backbone resonance assignments. This allowed a detailed investigation of the structural perturbations that accompany interactions involving both canonical and non-canonical recruitment events. No crystallographic information exists for the latter. We found that the chemical shift perturbations in inactive ERK2, indicative of structural changes in the presence of canonical and non-canonical motifs, are not restricted to the recruitment sites, but also involve the linker that connects the N- and C-lobes and, in most cases, a gatekeeper residue that is thought to exert allosteric control over catalytic activity. We also found that, even though the canonical motifs interact with the DRS utilizing both charge-charge and hydrophobic interactions, the non-canonical interactions primarily involve the latter. These results demonstrate the feasibility of solution NMR techniques for a comprehensive analysis of docking interactions in a full-length ERK/MAP kinase.",

Correspondence to: ude.mvu@eilbuoD.eivlyS","3′ processing is an essential step in the maturation of all messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and is a tightly coupled two-step reaction: endonucleolytic cleavage at the poly(A) site is followed by the addition of a poly(A) tail, except for metazoan histone mRNAs, which are cleaved but not polyadenylated. The recognition of a poly(A) site is coordinated by the sequence elements in the mRNA 3′ UTR and associated protein factors. In mammalian cells, three well-studied sequence elements, UGUA, AAUAAA, and GU-rich, are recognized by three multisubunit factors: cleavage factor Im (CFIm), cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), and cleavage stimulation factor (CstF), respectively. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, UA repeats and A-rich sequence elements are recognized by Hrp1p and cleavage factor IA. Structural studies of protein–RNA complexes have helped decipher the mechanisms underlying sequence recognition and shed light on the role of protein factors in poly(A) site selection and 3′ processing machinery assembly.

This review focused on such genes and analyzed shared biological pathways. Genetic markers were selected from a web-based collection (Alzgene). For each SNP in the database, it was possible to perform a meta-analysis. The quality of studies was assessed using criteria such as size of research samples, heterogeneity across studies, and protection from publication bias. This produced a list of 15 top-rated genes: APOE, CLU, PICALM, EXOC3L2, BIN1, CR1, SORL1, TNK1, IL8, LDLR, CST3, CHRNB2, SORCS1, TNF, and CCR2. A systematic analysis of gene ontology terms associated with each marker showed that most genes were implicated in cholesterol metabolism, intracellular transport of beta-amyloid precursor, and autophagy of damaged organelles. Moreover, the impact of these genes on complement cascade and cytokine production highlights the role of inflammatory response in AD pathogenesis. Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions are prominent issues in AD genetics, but they are not specifically featured in the Alzgene database.",

Given that they provide near-complete suppression of any background, SONICC images can be used to determine the presence or absence of protein crystals through both manual inspection and automated analysis. Because SONICC creates high-resolution images, nucleation and growth kinetics can also be observed. SONICC can detect metastable, homochiral crystalline forms of amino acids crystallizing from racemic solutions, which confirms Ostwald’s rule of stages for crystal growth. SONICC’s selectivity, based on order, and sensitivity, based on background suppression, make it a promising technique for numerous fields concerned with chiral crystal formation.",second harmonic generation;protein crystallization;drug formulation

Whereas experiments typically reveal only a few readily discernible exponential relaxations, simulations often indicate complex multistate behavior. Here, a theoretical framework is presented that reconciles these two approaches. The central concept is “dynamical fingerprints” which contain peaks at the time scales of the dynamical processes involved with amplitudes determined by the experimental observable. Fingerprints can be generated from both experimental and simulation data, and their comparison by matching peaks permits assignment of structural changes present in the simulation to experimentally observed relaxation processes. The approach is applied here to a test case interpreting single molecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments on a set of fluorescent peptides with molecular dynamics simulations. The peptides exhibit complex kinetics shown to be consistent with the apparent simplicity of the experimental data. Moreover, the fingerprint approach can be used to design new experiments with site-specific labels that optimally probe specific dynamical processes in the molecule under investigation.",Markov models;conformation dynamics;fluorescence correlation;kinetic experiments;T-jump

Molecular modeling of the three S1 pockets reveals substrate-enzyme interactions that are critical determinants for specificity. The substrate selectivity profiles suggest that IRAP largely combines the S1 specificity of ERAP1 and ERAP2, consistent with its proposed biological function. IRAP however, does not achieve this dual specificity by simply combining structural features of ERAP1 and 2, but rather by a unique amino acid change at position 541.

Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) titrations show that monomeric α-syn binds 1.0 equivalent of Cu2+ at the protein N-terminus. Next, an EPR competition technique demonstrates that α-syn binds Cu2+ with a Kd ≈ 0.10 nM. Finally, EPR and Electron Spin Echo Modulation (ESEEM) applied to a suite of mutant and truncated α-syn constructs reveal a coordination sphere arising from the N-terminal amine, the Asp2 amide backbone and side chain carboxyl group, and the His50 imidazole. The high binding affinity identified here, and in accord with previous measurements, suggests that copper uptake and sequestration may be a part of α-syn’s natural function, perhaps modulating copper’s redox properties. The findings further suggest that the long-range interaction between the N-terminus and His50 may have a weakening effect on α-syn interaction with lipid membranes thereby mobilizing monomeric α-syn and hastening fibrillogenesis.",

Molecular dynamics simulations illustrate how the simultaneous binding of substrate peptide, ATP and two Mg2+ ions is able to induce a more rigid and closed organization of the active site that functions to orient the phosphates, stabilize the buildup of negative charge, and shield the subsequently activated γ-phosphate from solvent.",

Results agree with a variety of experimental data including size cutoff for cargo transport with (30-nm diameter) and without (< 10 nm) nuclear localization signals (NLS), macroscopic transport rates (hundreds per second), and single cargo transit times (milliseconds). The recently observed bimodal cargo distribution is predicted, as is the relative invariance of single cargo transit times out to large size (even as macroscopic transport rate decreases). Additional predictions concern the effects of the number of NLS tags, the RanGTP gradient, and phenylalanine-glycine nucleopore protein (FG-Nup) structure, flexibility, and cross-linking. Results are consistent with and elucidate the molecular mechanisms of some existing hypotheses (selective phase, virtual gate, and selective gate models). A model emerges that is a hybrid of a number of preexisting models as well as a Brownian ratchet model, in which a cargo-karyopherin complex remains bound to the same FG-Nups for its entire trajectory through the nuclear pore complex until RanGTP severs the cargo-Nup bonds to effect release into the nucleus.",mathematical modeling;molecular motor;nuclear-cytoplasmic transport;nucleoporins;filament dynamics

The biophysical mechanisms underlying transport, however, remain unclear due to the lack of information about biophysical factors playing role in transport. Based on published experimental data, we have established a coarse-grained model of an intact NPC structure to examine nucleocytoplasmic transport with refined spatial and temporal resolutions. Using our model, we estimate the transport time versus cargo sizes. Our findings suggest that the mean transport time of cargos smaller than 15 nm is independent of size, while beyond this size, there is a sharp increase in the mean transport time. The model confirms that kap-FG hydrophobicity is sufficient for active cargo transport. Moreover, our model predicts that during translocation, small and large cargo-complexes are hydrophobically attached to FG-repeat domains for 86 and 96% of their transport time, respectively. Inside the central channel FG-repeats form a thick layer on the wall leaving an open tube. The cargo-complex is almost always attached to this layer and diffuses back and forth, regardless of the cargo size. Finally, we propose a plausible model for transport in which the NPC can be viewed as a lubricated gate. This model incorporates basic assumptions underlying virtual-gate and reduction-of-dimensionality models with the addition of the FG-layer inside the central channel acting as a lubricant.",

Acidosis decreases the calcium sensitivity and contractile efficiency of cardiac muscle. By contrast, skeletal and neonatal muscles are much less sensitive to changes in pH. The pH sensitivity of cardiac muscle can be reduced by replacing cardiac troponin I with its skeletal or neonatal counterparts. The isoform-specific response of troponin I is dictated by a single histidine, which is replaced by an alanine in cardiac troponin I. The decreased pH sensitivity may stem from the protonation of this histidine at low pH, which would promote the formation of electrostatic interactions with negatively charged residues on troponin C. In this study, we measured acid dissociation constants of glutamate residues on troponin C and of histidine on skeletal troponin I (His-130). The results indicate that Glu-19 comes in close contact with an ionizable group that has a pKa of ∼6.7 when it is in complex with skeletal troponin I but not when it is bound to cardiac troponin I. The pKa of Glu-19 is decreased when troponin C is bound to skeletal troponin I and the pKa of His-130 is shifted upward. These results strongly suggest that these residues form an electrostatic interaction. Furthermore, we found that skeletal troponin I bound to troponin C tighter at pH 6.1 than at pH 7.5.

In response to Wnt signals, TCF/LEF members undergo a transcriptional switch from repression to activation mediated in part by nuclear β-catenin binding and recruitment of co-activator complexes. In mammals, the specificity and fine tuning of this transcriptional switch is also achieved by the cell-context-dependent expression of four members (TCF7, TCF7L1, TCF7L2, and LEF1) and numerous variants, which display differential DNA binding affinity and specificity, repression strength, activation potential, and regulators. TCF7/LEF1 variants are generated by alternative promoters, alternative exon cassettes, and alternative donor/acceptor splicing sites, allowing combinatorial insertion/exclusion of modular functional and regulatory domains. In this review we present mounting evidence for the interdependency of TCF7/LEF1 variant expression and functions with cell lineage and cell state.

For this reason, it is desirable to obtain capture agents with high affinity, selectivity, and stability. The most commonly used capture agents for biomolecular analysis include antibodies, antibody fragments, complementary DNA (cDNA), and aptamers. While antibody production relies on immune challenge and hybridoma formation, nucleic acid capture agents can be obtained from solid-phase DNA synthesis or multiple rounds of selective enrichment (SELEX) to identify or evolve the most effective capture agent. Beyond the capture agent itself, careful attention must be paid to the manner by which surface attachment is achieved, as consideration of such factors as molecular orientation, specific attachment site, and capture agent stability over time may greatly influence the sensor performance. If a sensor array is to be multiplexed, a quality that is often very desirable when multiparameter analysis provides increased information from a single sample, the potential for capture agent cross reactivity is an additional concern. Spatial control over functionalization must also be maintained.

","Repair of G·T mismatches arising from deamination of 5-methylcytosine (m5C) involves excision of thymine and restoration of a G·C pair via base excision repair (BER). Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) is one of two mammalian enzymes that can specifically remove thymine from G·T mispairs. While TDG can excise other bases, it maintains stringent specificity for a CpG context, suggesting deaminated m5C is an important biological substrate. Recent studies reveal TDG is essential for embryogenesis; it helps maintain an active chromatin complex and initiates BER to counter aberrant de novo CpG methylation, which may involve excision of actively deaminated m5C. The relatively weak G·T activity of TDG has been implicated in the hypermutability of CpG sites, which largely involves C→T transitions arising from m5C deamination. Thus, it is important to understand how TDG recognizes and process substrates, particularly G·T mispairs. Here, we extend our detailed studies of TDG by examining the dependence of substrate binding and catalysis on pH, ionic strength, and temperature. Catalytic activity is relatively constant for pH 5.5-9, but falls sharply for pH >9 due to severely weakened substrate binding, and, potentially, ionization of the target base. Substrate binding and catalysis diminish sharply with increasing ionic strength, particularly for G·T substrates, due partly to effects on nucleotide flipping. TDG aggregates rapidly and irreversibly at 37 °C, but can be stabilized by specific and nonspecific DNA. The temperature dependence of catalysis reveals large and unexpected differences for G·U and G·T substrates, where G·T activity exhibits much steeper temperature dependence. The results suggest that reversible nucleotide flipping is much more rapid for G·T substrates, consistent with our previous findings that steric effects limit the active-site lifetime of thymine, which may account for the relatively weak G·T activity. Our findings provide important insight into catalysis by TDG, particularly for mutagenic G·T mispairs.",base excision repair;5-methylcytosine deamination;G·T mispair;CpG sites;fluorescence

We prepared H3(T118ph) by expressed protein ligation and determined its influence on nucleosome dynamics. We find H3(T118ph) reduces DNA–histone binding by 2 kcal/mol, increases nucleosome mobility by 28-fold and increases DNA accessibility near the dyad region by 6-fold. Moreover, H3(T118ph) increases the rate of hMSH2–hMSH6 nucleosome disassembly and enables nucleosome disassembly by the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler.

We then investigated the possible influence of this interaction on excitation contraction (EC) coupling. A peptide with the F loop sequence and an antibody to the SPRY2 domain each enhanced RyR1 activity at low concentrations and inhibited at higher concentrations. A peptide containing the ASI/basic sequence bound to SPRY2 and binding decreased ∼10-fold following mutation or structural disruption of the basic residues. Binding was abolished by mutation of three critical acidic F loop residues. Together these results suggest that the ASI/basic and SPRY2 domains interact in an F loop regulatory module.

Therefore the electrostatic regulatory interaction between the SPRY2 F loop residues (that bind to imperatoxin A) and the ASI/basic residues of RyR1 does not influence bi-directional DHPR-RyR1 signaling during skeletal EC coupling, possibly because the interaction is interrupted by the influence of factors present in intact muscle cells.",SPRY domain in RyR1;single RyR1 channel activity;alternatively spliced residues;skeletal muscle;excitation-contraction coupling

While the exact etiology of sporadic Parkinson's disease remains elusive, a growing body of evidence suggests that misfolded α-synuclein promotes inflammation and oxidative stress resulting in neurodegeneration. α-Synuclein has been directly linked to microglial activation in vitro and increased numbers of activated microglia have been reported in an α-synuclein overexpressing mouse model prior to neuronal loss. However, the mechanism by which α-synuclein incites microglial activation has not been fully described. Microglial activation is governed in part, by pattern recognition receptors that detect foreign material and additionally recognize changes in homeostatic cellular conditions. Upon proinflammatory pathway initiation, activated microglia contribute to oxidative stress through release of cytokines, nitric oxide, and other reactive oxygen species, which may adversely impact adjacent neurons. Here we show that microglia are directly activated by α-synuclein in a classical activation pathway that includes alterations in the expression of toll-like receptors. These data suggest that α-synuclein can act as a danger-associated molecular pattern.",microglial activation;pattern recognition receptors;DAMP;inflammation;Parkinson's disease

Experimental studies have provided strong evidence that the production and signaling effects of extracellular adenosine are dramatically enhanced during conditions of limited oxygen availability as occurs during ischemia. As such, adenosine would fit the bill of signaling molecules that are enhanced during situations of cellular distress. In contrast to a danger signal, we propose here that extracellular adenosine operates as a countermeasure, in fact as a safety signal, to both restrain potentially harmful immune responses and to maintain and promote general tissue integrity during conditions of limited oxygen availability.

Compact chromatin presents a barrier to these processes and is highly regulated by epigenetic markers binding to components of the nucleosome. Histone modifications directly influence chromatin dynamics and facilitate recruitment of additional factors such as chromatin remodelers and histone chaperones. One member of this last class of factors, FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription), is categorized as a histone chaperone critical for nucleosome reorganization during replication, transcription, and DNA repair. Significant discoveries regarding the role of histone chaperones and specifically FACT have come over the past dozen years from a number of independent laboratories.

However, only one area seems to be essential and sufficient for generating the respiratory rhythm: the preBötzinger complex (preBötC). Lesioning this area abolishes breathing and following isolation in a brain slice the preBötC continues to generate different forms of respiratory activities. The use of slice preparations led to a thorough understanding of the cellular mechanisms that underlie the generation of inspiratory activity within this network. Two types of inward currents, the persistent sodium current (INaP) and the calcium-activated non-specific cation current (ICAN), play important roles in respiratory rhythm generation. These currents give rise to autonomous pacemaker activity within respiratory neurons, leading to the generation of intrinsic spiking and bursting activity. These membrane properties amplify as well as activate synaptic mechanisms that are critical for the initiation and maintenance of inspiratory activity. In this review, we describe the dynamic interplay between synaptic and intrinsic membrane properties in the generation of the respiratory rhythm and we relate these mechanisms to rhythm generating networks involved in other behaviors.",Pacemaker;Respiration;Persistent sodium current;Calcium-activated non-specific cation current;preBötzinger complex;Rhythm generation;Bursting

These processes are highly regulated and require extrinsic factors such as chromatin remodelers and histone chaperones. The histone chaperone FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) is a large heterodimeric complex with roles in transcription, replication, and repair. FACT promotes and subsequently restricts access to DNA as a result of dynamic nucleosome reorganization. However, until now, there lacked a truly quantitative assessment of the critical contacts mediating FACT function. Here, we demonstrate that FACT binds histones, DNA, and intact nucleosomes at nanomolar concentrations. We also determine roles for the histone tails in free histone and nucleosome binding by FACT. Furthermore, we propose that the conserved acidic C-terminal domain of the FACT subunit Spt16 actively displaces nucleosomal DNA to provide access to the histone octamer. Experiments with tri-nucleosome arrays indicate a possible mode for FACT binding within chromatin. Together, the data reveal that specific FACT subunits synchronize interactions with various target sites on individual nucleosomes to generate a high affinity binding event and promote reorganization.",Chromatin Remodeling;Chromatin Structure;Chromosomes/Non-histone Chromosomal Proteins;Histone Chaperone;Nucleosome;FACT

Recent genetic studies reveal that mutations in the gene GBA are the most widespread genetic risk factor for parkinsonism identified to date. GBA encodes for glucocerebrosidase (GCase), the enzyme deficient in the lysosomal storage disorder, Gaucher disease (GD). In this work, we investigated the possibility of a physical linkage between α-syn and GCase, examining both wild type and the GD-related N370S mutant enzyme. Using fluorescence and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we determined that α-syn and GCase interact selectively under lysosomal solution conditions (pH 5.5) and mapped the interaction site to the α-syn C-terminal residues, 118–137. This α-syn-GCase complex does not form at pH 7.4 and is stabilized by electrostatics, with dissociation constants ranging from 1.2 to 22 μm in the presence of 25 to 100 mm NaCl. Intriguingly, the N370S mutant form of GCase has a reduced affinity for α-syn, as does the inhibitor conduritol-β-epoxide-bound enzyme. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies verified this interaction in human tissue and neuronal cell culture, respectively. Although our data do not preclude protein-protein interactions in other cellular milieux, we suggest that the α-syn-GCase association is favored in the lysosome, and that this noncovalent interaction provides the groundwork to explore molecular mechanisms linking PD with mutant GBA alleles.",Fluorescence;NMR;Protein Conformation;Protein-Protein Interactions;Synuclein

We previously found that I1–9 binds to superfibronectin, which is an artificial FN aggregate induced by anastellin. In the present study, we found that I1–9 bound to the aggregate formed by anastellin and a small FN fragment, III1–2. An engineered disulfide bond in III2, which stabilizes folding, inhibited aggregation, but a disulfide bond in III1 did not. A gelatin precipitation assay showed that I1–9 did not interact with anastellin, III1, III2, III1–2, or several III1–2 mutants including III1–2KADA. (In contrast to previous studies, we found that the III1–2KADA mutant was identical in conformation to wild-type III1–2.) Because I1–9 only bound to the aggregate and the unfolding of III2 played a role in aggregation, we generated a III2 domain that was destabilized by deletion of the G strand. This mutant bound I1–9 as shown by the gelatin precipitation assay and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis, and it inhibited FN matrix assembly when added to cell culture. Next, we introduced disulfide mutations into full-length FN. Three disulfide locks in III2, III3, and III11 were required to dramatically reduce anastellin-induced aggregation. When we tested the disulfide mutants in cell culture, only the disulfide bond in III2 reduced the FN matrix. These results suggest that the unfolding of III2 is one of the key factors for FN aggregation and assembly.",Extracellular Matrix;Fibronectin;Protein Assembly;Protein Self-assembly;Protein Stability;Protein-Protein Interactions

The MG ligand consists of three phenyl rings emanating from a central carbon, while TMR has two of the three rings connected by an ether linkage. The binding pockets for MG and TMR in the aptamer, known from high-resolution structure, differ only in the conformation of a few nucleotides. Herein, we applied isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to compare the thermodynamics for binding of MG and TMR to the aptamer. Binding heat capacities were obtained from ITC titrations over the temperature range of 15 to 60 °C. Two temperature regimes were found for MG binding: one from 15 to 45 °C where MG bound with a large negative heat capacity and an apparent stoichiometry (n) of ~0.4, and another from 50 to 60 °C where MG bound with positive heat capacity and n~1.1. The binding of TMR, on the other hand, revealed only one temperature regime for binding, with a more modest negative heat capacity and n~1.2. The large difference in heat capacity between the two ligands suggests that significantly more conformational rearrangement occurs upon the binding of MG than TMR, which is consistent with differences in solvent accessible surface area calculated for available ligand-bound structures. Lastly, we note that binding stoichiometry of MG was improved not only by raising the temperature, but also by lowering the concentration of Mg2+ or increasing the time between ITC injections. These studies suggest that binding of a dynamical ligand to a functional RNA requires the RNA itself to have significant dynamics.",RNA dynamics;heat capacity;thermodynamics;aptamer

Aβ aggregation is the key pathogenic event in Alzheimer disease, where Aβ oligomers are the major culprits. The fundamental mechanism of these metal ions on Aβ remains elusive. Here, we employ 4,4′-Bis(1-anilinonaphthalene 8-sulfonate) and tyrosine fluorescence, CD, stopped flow fluorescence, guanidine hydrochloride denaturation, and photo-induced cross-linking to elucidate the effect of Zn2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, and Al3+ on Aβ at the early stage of the aggregation. Furthermore, thioflavin T assay, dot blotting, and transmission electron microscopy are utilized to examine Aβ aggregation. Our results show that Al3+ and Zn2+, but not Cu2+ and Fe3+, induce larger hydrophobic exposures of Aβ conformation, resulting in its significant destabilization at the early stage. The metal ion binding induces Aβ conformational changes with micromolar binding affinities and millisecond binding kinetics. Cu2+ and Zn2+ induce similar assembly of transiently appearing Aβ oligomers at the early state. During the aggregation, we found that Zn2+ exclusively promotes the annular protofibril formation without undergoing a nucleation process, whereas Cu2+ and Fe3+ inhibit fibril formation by prolonging the nucleation phases. Al3+ also inhibits fibril formation; however, the annular oligomers co-exist in the aggregation pathway. In conclusion, Zn2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, and Al3+ adopt distinct folding and aggregation mechanisms to affect Aβ, where Aβ destabilization promotes annular protofibril formation.

","In this design strategy, pioneered by Mirkin and coworkers, both 2D and 3D supramolecular assemblies are accessible using hemilabile ligands and transition metals.11 The hemilabile, flexible ligands coordinate in a bidentate chelating mode to the metal center such that one of the metal-ligand bonds is weaker than the other. The formation of the kinetically controlled product is driven by the chelating effect of the bidentate ligands and the π–π interaction between the two central bridging units (Scheme 1). The weak ligands of this condensed intermediate structure can be selectively displaced upon treatment with small molecules or ions that have stronger affinity for the metal center, thereby generating the thermodynamically controlled product. One important feature of this approach is the conformational flexibility of the ligand. The coordinative lability of the metal centers imparts flexibility to the supramolecular arrays, making this design strategy different from the other approaches in which the final products are rigid. The flexibility of the architectures also makes the ensembles potential candidates for applications that require conformational changes, such as in molecular sensing, catalysis and host-guest chemistry. The fact that the metal centers are free for further coordination without the supramolecular assembly being destroyed makes this approach amenable for the construction of more complex topologies.",

The JNK-JIP1 interaction represents an attractive target for the inhibition of JNK-mediated signaling. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations have been performed on the apo-JNK1, and the JNK1•L-pepJIP1 and JNK1•D-pepJIP1 complexes to investigate the interaction between the JIP1 peptides and JNK1. Dynamic domain studies based on essential dynamics (ED) analysis of apo-JNK1 and the JNK1•L-pepJIP1 complex have been performed to analyze and compare details of conformational changes, hinge axes, and hinge bending regions in both structures. The activation loop, the αC helix and the G loop are found to be flexible and to exhibit changes in dynamics upon L-pepJIP1 binding. The conformation of the activation loop for the apo state is similar to the inactive form of apo ERK2, while for the JNK1•L-pepJIP1 complex, it is more like the inactive form of ERK2 bound to pepHePTP. ED analysis shows that, after the binding of L-pepJIP1, the N- and C- terminal domains of JNK1 display both a closure and a twisting motion centered around the activation loop, which functions as a hinge. In contrast, no domain motion is detected for the apo state whose open conformation is favored, consistent with a previous study of Src and Lck kinases that interlobe opening motion was needed for the possible intramolecular self-activation. The present study suggests that L-pepJIP1 regulates the inter-domain motions of JNK1 and potentially the active site via an allosteric mechanism. The binding free energies of L-pepJIP1 and D-pepJIP1 to JNK1 are estimated using the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann and Generalized-Born surface area (MM-PB/GBSA) methods. The contribution of each residue at the interaction interface to the binding affinity of L-pepJIP1 with JNK1 has been analyzed by means of computational alanine-scanning mutagenesis and free energy decomposition. Several critical interactions for binding (e.g. Arg156/L-pepJIP1 and Glu329/JNK1) have been identified. The binding free energy calculation indicates that the electrostatic interaction contributes critically to specificity, rather than to binding affinity between the peptide and JNK1. Notably, the binding free energy calculations predict that D-pepJIP1 binding to JNK1 is significantly weaker than the L form, contradicting the previous suggestion that D-pepJIP1 acts as an inhibitor towards JNK1. We have performed experiments using purified JNK1 to confirm that indeed, D-pepJIP1 does not inhibit the ability of JNK1 to phosphorylate c-Jun in vitro.",

The dominant negative effect of p53 mutants results from their aggregation propensity which causes co-aggregation of WT p53. We explored the mechanism of p53 inactivation in hypoxia and hypothesized whether WT p53 could rescue Mt p53 in hypoxic tumors. WT p53 exists in mutant conformation in hypoxic core of MCF-7 solid tumors, and its conformation is oxygen-dependent. Under simulated hypoxia in cells, WT p53 undergoes conformational change in acquiring mutant conformation. An in vivo chaperone assay shows that WT p53 functions as a molecular chaperone in rescuing conformational and structural p53 mutants in cancer cells both at the transcription and proteome levels. WT p53 chaperone therapy is further shown to cause significant regression of tumor xenografts through reconversion of the mutant phenotype to wild-type p53. The chaperone function of WT p53 is directly linked to the induction of apoptosis in both cancer cells and tumor xenografts. As oncogenic p53 mutants are linked to chemoresistance in hypoxic tumors, p53 chaperone therapy will introduce new dimensions to existing cancer therapeutics. We propose that in cancer cells, WT p53 chaperoning may either exist as a cellular event to potentially reverse the dominant negative effect of its oncogenic mutants or to stabilize yet unidentified factors.",Apoptosis;Chaperone Chaperonin;Hypoxia;p53;Tumor Therapy;Molecular Chaperone;Mutant Conformation;Wild-type Conformation;p53 Chaperone Therapy

However, the affinity between the Polη UBZ and ubiquitin was shown to be low with a previously reported Kd of 73~81 μM. This low-affinity binding between Polη UBZ and ubiquitin has been difficult to reconcile with its presumed role in translesion synthesis as suggested by genetic and cell biology studies. In this work, we constructed a minimal S. cerevisiae Polη UBZ domain and probed the Polη UBZ-ubiquitin interaction using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique. Our quantitative binding data between the wild-type or mutant Polη UBZ and ubiquitin revealed an interesting divergence between the Polη UBZ from S. cerevisiae and humans. Moreover, we found that the C-terminal portion of yeast Polη (amino acid 515~632) binds ubiquitin with a much higher affinity than the minimal UBZ domain. Further, distinct ubiquitin-binding kinetics were observed for the C-terminal portion of Polη and the isolated UBZ domain. This observation raised the interesting possibility that the Polη C-terminal portion binds ubiquitin in a novel mode that affords higher affinity. Our findings have broader implication in understanding the generally weak interaction between the known ubiquitin-binding domains and ubiquitin.",Ubiquitin binding zinc finger;PCNA;translesion synthesis;polymerase eta

In most prokaryotes and simple eukaryotes these two enzymes are encoded by separate genes, whereas in mammals they are expressed as a bifunctional gene product called UMP synthase (UMPS), with OPRT at the N terminus and OMPDC at the C terminus. Leishmania and some closely related organisms also express a bifunctional enzyme for these two steps, but the domain order is reversed relative to mammalian UMPS. In this work we demonstrate that L. donovani UMPS (LdUMPS) is an essential enzyme in promastigotes and that it is sequestered in the parasite glycosome. We also present the crystal structure of the LdUMPS in complex with its product, UMP. This structure reveals an unusual tetramer with two head to head and two tail to tail interactions, resulting in two dimeric OMPDC and two dimeric OPRT functional domains.

One such mechanism is the exchange of arginine (Arg+) from the extracellular region with its intracellular decarboxylated form, agmatine (Agm2+). The net result of this process is the export of a virtual proton from the cytoplasm per antiport cycle. Crystal structures of the arginine/agmatine antiporter from Escherichia coli, AdiC, have been recently resolved in both the apo and Arg+-bound outward-facing conformations, which permit us to assess for the first time the time-resolved mechanisms of interactions that enable the specific antiporter functionality of AdiC. Using data from ∼1 μs of molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the protonation of Glu-208 selectively causes the dissociation and release of Agm2+, but not Arg+, to the cell exterior. The impact of Glu-208 protonation is transmitted to the substrate binding pocket via the reorientation of Ile-205 carbonyl group at the irregular portion of transmembrane (TM) helix 6. This effect, which takes place only in the subunits where Agm2+ is released, invites attention to the functional role of the unwound portion of TM helices (TM6 Trp-202–Glu-208 in AdiC) in facilitating substrate translocation, reminiscent of the behavior observed in structurally similar Na+-coupled transporters.",Amino Acid Transport;Computer Modeling;Membrane Proteins;Molecular Dynamics;Protein Conformation;Protein Structure

Gap junction channel assembly, function and turnover are regulated by phosphorylation under both normal and disease conditions. The carboxyl terminus (CT) of Cx43 contains numerous amino acid residues that are phosphorylated by protein kinases. However, our knowledge of the specific residues and kinases involved is incomplete. The objective of this study was to identify amino acid residues in the Cx43-CT that are targets of the multi-functional protein kinase, Ca2+/calmodulin protein kinase II (CaMKII), an enzyme known to play critical roles in Ca2+ homeostasis, transcription, apoptosis and ischemic heart disease. We subjected fusion protein containing the Cx43-CT to phosphorylation by CaMKII in vitro, digestion with Lys-C and trypsin followed by enrichment for phosphorylated peptides using TiO2, and analysis in an LTQ XL Orbitrap with collision-induced dissociation and electron transfer dissociation. We deduced the sites of modification by interpreting tandem spectra from these “orthogonal” methods of gas phase peptide fragmentation. We have identified 15 serine residues, including one novel site, in the Cx43-CT that are phosphorylated by CaMKII, the activity of which may be important in regulating Cx43 in normal and diseased hearts.",serine phosphorylation;Orbitrap;ETD;CID;C-terminal fusion protein

","Despite a 95% sequence similarity, the aggregation of human and mouse α-synuclein is remarkably different, as the human form is slower than the mouse form in forming fibrils, but is associated with Parkinson’s disease both in humans and transgenic mice. Here, the amino acid code underlying these differences is investigated by comparing the lag times, growth rates and secondary structure propensities of a systematic series of eight human-mouse chimeras. Fluorescence analysis of the human-mouse variants shows that the A53T substitution dominates the growth kinetics, while the lag phase is affected by a combination of the A53T and S87N substitutions. The secondary structure propensities derived from an NMR chemical shift analysis of the monomeric forms of the human-mouse variants enables us to establish a link between the changes in the conformational properties in the region of position 53 upon mutation and the corresponding changes in growth rates. These results suggest that the presence of an alanine residue at position 53 may be an evolutionary adaptation to minimize Parkinson’s disease in humans and indicates that effective drug development efforts may be directed to target this N-terminal region of the sequence.",Amloid fibril formation;Nuclear magnetic resonance;Fluorescence;Intrinsically disordered protein;Parkinson’s diseases

Thus, tissues, and not individual cells, are the proper level of observation for the study of carcinogenesis. This paradigm shift from a reductionist approach to a systems biology approach is long overdue. Indeed, cell phenotypes are emergent modes arising through collective non-linear interactions among different cellular and microenvironmental components, generally described by “phase space diagrams”, where stable states (attractors) are embedded into a landscape model. Within this framework, cell states and cell transitions are generally conceived as mainly specified by gene-regulatory networks. However, the system s dynamics is not reducible to the integrated functioning of the genome-proteome network alone; the epithelia-stroma interacting system must be taken into consideration in order to give a more comprehensive picture. Given that cell shape represents the spatial geometric configuration acquired as a result of the integrated set of cellular and environmental cues, we posit that fractal-shape parameters represent “omics descriptors of the epithelium-stroma system. Within this framework, function appears to follow form, and not the other way around.",system biology;cancer;fractal analysis;complexity;carcinogenesis;non linear dynamics

Thus, each bin/microstate is defined by both a range of HB values and a range of rmsd values. In this way, a discretized trajectory s(t) ∈ [1,2,...N]∀t ∈ [0,Tf] was obtained, where Tf is the total simulation time. Uniform binning (i.e., all bins having the same width along each of the two observables) resulted in poor statistics for some of the transitions between microstates, which compromised the accuracy of the rate matrix diagonalization (data not shown). Thus, a variable binning strategy was adopted, which requires a few iterations of the following algorithm. Starting from a single two-dimensional bin containing all the data points, bins containing more than ntb = 12 000 points were evenly split into four smaller identical bins with halved width along each dimension, and the data points were redistributed in the four smaller bins. No splitting was performed for bins whose width was equal or smaller than (ΔHB = 0.25 × Δrmsd = 0.625), both to limit the total number of bins and to prevent artificial splitting of very similar conformations. This procedure favors a more uniform distribution of the data points into the bins (i.e., the microstates), and eventually leads to more accurate estimates for transition probabilities between microstates. The binning procedure was applied separately for the simulations at 300, 330, and 360 K, resulting in different numbers of bins/microstates at each temperature.

Furthermore, sequence reshuffling does not change the distributions of non-local interactions and, to a large extent, amino acids in the dimer volume. To rationalize these results, we demonstrate that Gaussian statistics applies surprisingly well to the end-to-end distances of the peptides in the dimer implying that non-bonded interactions between distant along the chain amino acids are effectively screened. This observation suggests that peptides in the dimer behave as ideal chains in polymer melt, in which amino acids lose their “identity” and therefore the memory of sequence position. As a result large-scale properties of the dimer become universal or sequence independent.

Although their lectin function of binding monoglucosylated sugar moieties of glycoproteins is well documented, their chaperone activity in suppressing protein aggregation is less well understood. Here, we use a series of deletion mutants of calreticulin to demonstrate that its aggregation suppression function resides primarily within its lectin domain. Using hydrophobic peptides as substrate mimetics, we show that aggregation suppression is mediated through a single polypeptide binding site that exhibits a Kd for peptides of 0.5–1 μm. This site is distinct from the oligosaccharide binding site and differs from previously identified sites of binding to thrombospondin and GABARAP (4-aminobutyrate type A receptor-associated protein). Although the arm domain of calreticulin was incapable of suppressing aggregation or binding hydrophobic peptides on its own, it did contribute to aggregation suppression in the context of the whole molecule. The high resolution x-ray crystal structure of calreticulin with a partially truncated arm domain reveals a marked difference in the relative orientations of the arm and lectin domains when compared with calnexin. Furthermore, a hydrophobic patch was detected on the arm domain that mediates crystal packing and may contribute to calreticulin chaperone function.",Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER);Glycoprotein Biosynthesis;Lectin;Peptide Interactions;X-ray Crystallography;Calreticulin;Molecular Chaperone;Protein Folding

The activity of AR requires regions within the N-terminal domain (NTD) in a manner that is distinct from the activation of related steroid hormone receptors. Unequivocal evidence has been amassed to consider that the AR axis is the most critical pathway for the progression of prostate cancer. Qualitatively distinct insight into AR pathobiology has been garnered that include AR-regulated gene expression is stage-specifically modulated during disease progression and that ligand requirement for AR activity could be rendered dispensable due to expression of constitutively active AR splice variants that are devoid of LBD. The recent appreciation of the clinical challenge that stems from non-gonadal androgens that are not inhibited by traditional hormonal therapies has been tangibly translated into the development of more potent drugs that can potentially lead towards achieving an androgen-free environment. The pre-clinical evidence that proves the AR NTD is a druggable target also forecasts further paradigm shift in the management of advanced prostate cancer. These advancements together with the identification of more robust AR antagonists and their promising clinical outcome has renewed the hope that targeting the AR pathway remains a sound strategy in the clinical management of prostate cancer. Here, we address these developments with a greater emphasis to the rapidly growing literature on AR splice variants.",Androgen receptor;splice variants;castration-resistant prostate cancer;CRPC;NTD;amino-terminus;LBD;prostate cancer

Recent cross-linking data further reveal that at least two of the activators utilize the same binding surface within Med15 for transcriptional activation. To determine whether these three activators use a shared binding mechanism for Med15 recruitment, we characterized the thermodynamics and kinetics of Med15·activator·DNA complex formation by fluorescence titration and stopped-flow techniques. Combination of each activator·DNA complex with Med15 produced biphasic time courses. This is consistent with a minimum two-step binding mechanism composed of a bimolecular association step limited by diffusion, followed by a conformational change in the Med15·activator·DNA complex. Furthermore, the equilibrium constant for the conformational change (K2) correlates with the ability of an activator to stimulate transcription. VP16, the most potent of the activators, has the largest K2 value, whereas Gcn4, the least potent, has the smallest value. This correlation is consistent with a model in which transcriptional activation is regulated at least in part by the rearrangement of the Med15·activator·DNA ternary complex. These results are the first detailed kinetic characterization of the transcriptional activation machinery and provide a framework for the future design of potent transcriptional activators.",Kinetics;Protein-Protein Interactions;Transcription;Transcription Coactivators;Transcription Factors

Early reports suggested that SIRT6 performs ADP-ribosylation, whereas more recent studies have suggested that SIRT6 functions mainly as a histone deacetylase. Thus, the molecular functions of SIRT6 remain uncertain. Here, we perform biochemical, kinetic, and structural studies to provide new mechanistic insight into the functions of SIRT6. Utilizing three different assays, we provide biochemical and kinetic evidence that SIRT6-dependent histone deacetylation produces O-acetyl-ADP-ribose but at a rate ∼1,000 times slower than other highly active sirtuins. To understand the molecular basis for such low deacetylase activity, we solved the first crystal structures of this class IV sirtuin in complex with ADP-ribose and the non-hydrolyzable analog of O-acetyl-ADP-ribose, 2′-N-acetyl-ADP-ribose. The structures revealed unique features of human SIRT6, including a splayed zinc-binding domain and the absence of a helix bundle that in other sirtuin structures connects the zinc-binding motif and Rossmann fold domain. SIRT6 also lacks the conserved, highly flexible, NAD+-binding loop and instead contains a stable single helix. These differences led us to hypothesize that SIRT6, unlike all other studied sirtuins, would be able to bind NAD+ in the absence of an acetylated substrate. Indeed, we found that SIRT6 binds NAD+ with relatively high affinity (Kd = 27 ± 1 μm) in the absence of an acetylated substrate. Isothermal titration calorimetry and tryptophan fluorescence binding assays suggested that ADP-ribose and NAD+ induce different structural perturbations and that NADH does not bind to SIRT6. Collectively, these new insights imply a unique activating mechanism and/or the possibility that SIRT6 could act as an NAD+ metabolite sensor.",Enzyme Catalysis;Enzyme Mechanisms;Histone Deacetylase;Metabolic Regulation;NAD;Sirtuins;Transcription;Transcription Regulation;SIRT6

To elucidate the structural mechanism of activation, we have studied RLC phosphorylation in tarantula thick filaments, whose high resolution structure is known. In the relaxed state, tarantula RLCs are ~50% non- and 50% mono-phosphorylated, while on activation mono-phosphorylation increases and some RLCs become bi-phosphorylated. Mass spectrometry shows that relaxed-state mono-phosphorylation occurs on Ser35 while Ca2+-activated phosphorylation is on Ser45, both located near the RLC N-terminus. The sequences around these serines suggest they are the targets for protein kinase C (PKC) and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) respectively. The atomic model of the tarantula filament shows that the two myosin heads (“free” and “blocked”) are in different environments, with only the free head serines readily accessible to kinases. Thus PKC Ser35 mono-phosphorylation in relaxed filaments would occur only on the free heads. Structural considerations suggest these heads are less strongly bound to the filament backbone, and may oscillate occasionally between attached and detached states (“swaying” heads). These heads would be available for immediate actin interaction upon Ca2+-activation of the thin filaments. Once MLCK becomes activated, it phosphorylates free heads on Ser45. These heads become fully mobile, exposing blocked-head Ser45 to MLCK. This would release the blocked-heads, allowing their interaction with actin. On this model, twitch force would be produced by rapid interaction of swaying free heads with activated thin filaments, while prolonged exposure to Ca2+ on tetanus would recruit new, MLCK-activated heads, resulting in force potentiation.",Myosin regulation;myosin regulatory light chain;striated muscle;twitch potentiation;post-tetanic potentiation

Some inactive conformations are, however, observed repeatedly in different kinases, perhaps reflecting an important role in catalysis. In this review, we analyze one of these recurring conformations, first identified in CDK and Src kinases, which turned out to be central to understanding of how kinase domain of the EGF receptor is activated. This mechanism, which involves the stabilization of the active conformation of an α helix, has features in common with mechanisms operative in several other kinases.",

Residues in the intracellular loop domain (ILD) have recently been shown to define part of the ion permeation pathway in several closely related members of the pentameric ligand gated ion channel family. In this study, we investigated the role the ILD of the GABAAR α1 subunit plays in channel function. Deletion of the α1 ILD resulted in a significant increase in GABA EC50 and maximal current amplitude, suggesting that the ILD must be intact for proper receptor function. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a mutagenic screen of all amino acids harboring ionizable side chains within this domain to investigate the contribution of individual charged residues to ion permeation. Using macroscopic and single channel voltage-clamp recording techniques, we found that mutations within a subdomain of the α1 ILD near M3 altered GABA apparent affinity; interestingly, α1(K312E) exhibited reduced partial agonist efficacy. We introduced point mutations near M4, including α1(K383E) and α1(K384E), that enhanced receptor desensitization. Mutation of 5 charged residues within a 39-residue span contiguous with M4 reduced relative anion permeability of the channel and may represent a weak intracellular selectivity filter. Within this subdomain, the α1(K378E) mutation induced a significant reduction in single channel conductance, consistent with our hypothesis that the GABAAR α1 ILD contributes directly to the permeation pathway.",Biophysics;Cell Surface Receptor;GABA Receptors;Ion Channels;Site-directed Mutagenesis;Conductance;Patch Clamp Electrophysiology

Glutamate mediates the vast majority of fast excitatory transmission in the brain, while γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), another amino acid neurotrasmitter, mediates the vast majority of fast inhibitory transmission. As an example, it has been estimated that, in the whole brain, there are approximately two to three hundred thousand serotonergic neurons out of a hundred billion total neurons (Baker et al., 1991). In humans, neocortex represents about 85% of the total brain mass. Modern stereological methods have estimated that about 80% of neurons in neocortex are spiny and excitatory and form 85% of all synapses, while about 20% of the neurons are smooth and inhibitory, forming 15% of the synapses (Douglas and Martin, 2007). These data indicate that glutamate neurons and synapses by far outnumber all other neurotransmitter systems in the brain, with the only exception of GABAergic system. In other words the brain, under the point of view of chemical neurotransmission, is largely a glutamatergic excitatory machine, regulated by a relatively smaller GABAergic inhibitory component and modulated by a much smaller number of neurons releasing a variety of other neurotransmitters (including monoamines). It is well-known that monoamines, by regulating fast chemical neurotransmission, modulate all forms of brain function, including sleep/wakefulness, biological drive-related activities mediated by the hypothalamus, emotional/motivational activities mediated by limbic circuitry and value-based behaviors in the neocortex (Othmer et al., 1998; Pralong et al., 2002). However, it is ultimately the changes in excitatory transmission, counterbalanced by the inhibitory component, that actually mediate these functions, in particular cognition and emotion which, as we discuss in the following section, are inextricably intermingled.",Glutamate;major depression;mood disorder;antidepressant;stress;NMDA receptor

Sublethal infection of mice with an H1N1 influenza virus related to that of the 1918 pandemic triggers massive airway damage followed by apparent regeneration. We show here that p63-expressing stem cells in the bronchiolar epithelium undergo rapid proliferation after infection and radiate to interbronchiolar regions of alveolar ablation. Once there, these cells assemble into discrete, Krt5+ pods and initiate expression of markers typical of alveoli. Gene expression profiles of these pods suggest that they are intermediates in the reconstitution of the alveolar-capillary network eradicated by viral infection.

In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the formation of retinal mosaics and the regulation of photopigment (opsin) expression in the fly, mouse and human retina. Despite distinct evolutionary origins, as well as major differences in morphology and phototransduction machineries, there are significant similarities in the stepwise cell-fate decisions that lead from progenitor cells to terminally differentiated photoreceptors that express a particular opsin. Common themes include i) the use of binary transcriptional switches that distinguish classes of photoreceptors, ii) the use of gradients of signaling molecules for regional specializations, iii) stochastic choices that pattern the retina and iv) the use of permissive factors with multiple roles in different photoreceptor types.",photoreceptor;opsin;colour vision;retinal mosaic;transcription factors

Cytokine signals, epigenetic modifications and other microenvironmental factors can substantially and, in some cases, rapidly and reversibly alter the phenotype of these cells and influence their function.

A reverse G•U wobble was observed in a recent crystal structure of the precleaved state. This unusual base pair positions a Mg2+ ion to participate in catalysis. Herein, we used molecular dynamics (MD) and X-ray crystallography to characterize the conformation and metal binding characteristics of this base pair in product and precleaved forms. Beginning with a crystal structure of the product form, we observed formation of the reverse G•U wobble during MD trajectories. We also demonstrated that this base pair is compatible with the diffraction data for the product-bound state. During MD trajectories of the product form, Na+ ions interacted with the reverse G•U wobble in the RNA active site, and a Mg2+ ion, introduced in certain trajectories, remained bound at this site. Beginning with a crystal structure of the precleaved form, the reverse G•U wobble with bound Mg2+ remained intact during MD simulations. When we removed Mg2+ from the starting precleaved structure, Na+ ions interacted with the reverse G•U wobble. In support of the computational results, we observed competition between Na+ and Mg2+ in the precleaved ribozyme crystallographically. Non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann calculations revealed a negatively charged patch near the reverse G•U wobble. This anionic pocket likely serves to bind metal ions and to help shift the pKa of the catalytic nucleobase, C75. Thus, the reverse G•U wobble motif serves to organize two catalytic elements, a metal ion and catalytic nucleobase, within the active site of the HDV ribozyme.",

Obesity occurs when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure; however, individuals vary widely in their propensity to gain weight and accrue fat mass, even at identical levels of excess caloric input. Clinical, epidemiological, and biological studies show that obesity is largely programmed during early life, including the intrauterine period. The environmental obesogen hypothesis holds that prenatal or early life exposure to certain endocrine disrupting chemicals can predispose exposed individuals to increased fat mass and obesity. Obesogen exposure can alter the epigenome of multipotent stromal stem cells, biasing them toward the adipocyte lineage at the expense of bone. Hence, humans exposed to obesogens during early life might have an altered stem cell compartment, which is preprogrammed toward an adipogenic fate. This results in a higher steady state number of adipocytes and potentially a lifelong struggle to maintain a healthy weight, which can be exacerbated by societal influences that promote poor diet and inadequate exercise. This review focuses on the developmental origins of the adipocyte, the relationship between adipocyte number and obesity, and how obesogenic chemicals may interfere with the highly efficient homeostatic mechanisms regulating adipocyte number and energy balance.",obesogen;endocrine disrupter;EDC;PPARγ;nuclear receptor;adipogenesis;obesity;stem cells;multipotent stromal cells;MSCs;epigenetics;transgenerational

It is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, has multiple aetiologies, and increases the risk of death from stroke. Pharmacological therapy is the mainstay of treatment for AF, but currently available anti-arrhythmic drugs have limited efficacy and safety. An improved understanding of how anti-arrhythmic drugs affect the electrophysiological mechanisms of AF initiation and maintenance, in the setting of the different cardiac diseases that predispose to AF, is therefore required. A variety of animal models of AF has been developed, to represent and control the pathophysiological causes and risk factors of AF, and to permit the measurement of detailed and invasive parameters relating to the associated electrophysiological mechanisms of AF. The purpose of this review is to examine, consolidate and compare available relevant data on in-vivo electrophysiological mechanisms of AF suppression by currently approved and investigational anti-arrhythmic drugs in such models. These include the Vaughan Williams class I-IV drugs, namely Na+ channel blockers, β-adrenoceptor antagonists, action potential prolonging drugs, and Ca2+ channel blockers; the “upstream therapies”, e.g., angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, statins and fish oils; and a variety of investigational drugs such as “atrial-selective” multiple ion channel blockers, gap junction-enhancers, and intracellular Ca2+-handling modulators. It is hoped that this will help to clarify the main electrophysiological mechanisms of action of different and related drug types in different disease settings, and the likely clinical significance and potential future exploitation of such mechanisms.",Atrial fibrillation;Cardiac arrhythmia mechanisms: reentry;afterdepolarisations;In-vivo animal models;Pathological electrical remodelling;Pharmacological treatment;Anti-arrhythmic drug mechanisms

Surprisingly, PVAT has been reported to share characteristics of both brown and white adipose, but a detailed direct comparison to interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) has not been performed. Here we show by full genome DNA microarray analysis that global gene expression profiles of PVAT are virtually identical to BAT, with equally high expression of Ucp-1, Cidea, and other genes known to be uniquely or very highly expressed in BAT. PVAT and BAT also displayed nearly identical phenotypes upon immunohistochemical analysis, and electron microscopy confirmed that PVAT contained multilocular lipid droplets and abundant mitochondria. Compared with white adipose tissue (WAT), PVAT and BAT from C57BL6/J mice fed a high-fat diet for 13 wk had markedly lower expression of immune cell-enriched mRNAs, suggesting resistance to obesity-induced inflammation. Indeed, staining of BAT and PVAT for macrophage markers (F4/80 and CD68) in obese mice showed virtually no macrophage infiltration, and FACS analysis of BAT confirmed the presence of very few CD11b+/CD11c+ macrophages in BAT (1.0%) compared with WAT (31%). In summary, murine PVAT from the thoracic aorta is virtually identical to interscapular BAT, is resistant to diet-induced macrophage infiltration, and thus may play an important role in protecting the vascular bed from inflammatory stress.",obesity;microarray;macrophages;lipid droplet proteins;diabetes
